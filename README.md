Archive of the original SCDiet.org site created by [Mik Aidt](https://twitter.com/mikaidt) and [Mike Simons](http://www.glassbird.com/)

Created to help people using Elaine Gottschall's version of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), from 1996 through 2016, this site lived at www.scdiet.org.

This archive contains the static HTML and images from the site.

Please see the versions tab for:

  1. The original version where pages were hardcoded with links to "http://www.scdiet.org"
  2. Versions where the references to "http://www.scdiet.org" have been removed in order to run this from alternative servers:
        1. The "archive" version where the files may placed at the **root directory** of a web server.
        2. The "archive subdirectory" where the files may be placed in the subfolder of an existing web server.
          - For this version, do a search/replace over all of the files, changing:
            - **From**: "||ARCHIVE_SUBDIRECTORY||/"
            - **To**: your folder name.  e.g. "/archive/"
