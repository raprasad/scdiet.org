              &gt;&gt;Hey y'all, I'm compiling a current list of success stories 
              and testimonials to the SCD for the scdiet.org site. If you have 
              something to say "for the record", now is the time to say it :-) 
              We're looking for stories from anyone on the diet- from one month 
              to one decade. <br>
              Thanks in advance, Mike Simons&gt;&gt; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here's our 
              story Mike:<br>
              My wife has had Crohn's Disease since 1973. Since that time she 
              has endured treatments of Azulfidine (bad side effects due to headache 
              and light sensitivity), one night in the hospital where they did 
              little more than watch her, and several rounds of prednisone (which 
              help for a while). Then there were numerous days in bed with the 
              heating pad and many days of fasting during days of bad pain. Hot 
              baths sometimes helped a little. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A friend from 
              Canada suggested that she try the SCD diet. After reading the positive 
              reviews in Amazon.com for "Breaking the Vicious Cycle" we decided 
              to try it in August, 1999. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We didn't know 
              what to expect. Within 24 hours the gas and pains were reduced significantly. 
              This was the first really encouraging news in 26 years since it 
              offered the possibility of long-term help. The "D" started to decrease 
              significantly in a period of days. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now we are at 
              the six-month mark. The results have been very encouraging. She 
              rarely spends days in bed, although there is still some pain. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has also 
              been a side benefit. I have not read too much of a link between 
              Crohn's pain and headache, but she often has the two together, or 
              one after the other. Since being on the SCD she has almost been 
              without headaches at all. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are both 
              Christians who love the Lord Jesus, and are thankful to God, to 
              Elaine, and others who have fought to get out the news about SCD. 
              We certainly didn't hear about it from the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation 
              or any of the Doctors we have consulted! Wouldn't it be great if 
              someone spent some real money to research this and refine it? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It takes some 
              work to prepare the food, pack it up to bring to church dinners 
              or to visit friends, but it has been more than worth it since it 
              has saved so much time and pain from being sick. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have been 
              glad to pass the SCD on to others. One family had a teenaged son 
              who had been having a rough time. His mom said that the diet had 
              definitely been helping him and was starting to get encouraged. 
              But the Doctors also had him on methotrexate. One day last December 
              bacteria from his gut got into his blood stream, and he died the 
              next day. His family said that they had not been informed that the 
              drug he was on lowered his immune system or they would not have 
              consented to it. Needless to say they were upset about the whole 
              thing. They had only wished that they had found out about the SCD 
              earlier. </font></p>

              Beginning SCD experiences with colitis <br>
              Date: Sun, 19 Mar 2000<br>
              From: Callahan callahan@webspan.net</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Hi Christopher, <br>
              You wanted to hear experiences starting the scd and colitis. Well, 
              I have u colitis and started SCD two years ago. I was in the midst 
              of a nasty flare coming off 6mp when I started scd (I'd been in 
              remission for four years with 6mp, but wanted off drugs). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is how 
              the beginning of scd had gone for me. Others with colitis have had 
              similar experiences. Most of us needed more time than the book mentions. 
              At least two months, then once all is okay many of us wound up with 
              the "three month flare" for me that got under control in a couple 
              of weeks. Hang in there. Like you, I also knew I was on the right 
              track. I wasn't getting worse and I was starting to slowly feel 
              better everyday!!! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D stopped 
              a short while after starting the diet. I drank at least eight large 
              glasses of water a day, every day! I didn't drink any juice,tea 
              coffee. Only cooked food agreed with me, I couldn't tolerate veggies 
              or nut flour in the early weeks. I didn't eat raw fruit (a little 
              cooked apple or pear and some cooked veggies once in a while). I 
              ate yogurt and farmers cheese and the cheese cake along with too 
              many hamburgers (all different types of meat for variety lamb, beef, 
              pork, or turkey) chicken breasts, fish, and soup. Loosing weight 
              was good for me. I was fat from years of drugs, malabsorption, low 
              fat high grain diet. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It took at least 
              eight weeks for the blood and Mucus to stop and feelings of urgency 
              to completely disappear. It seemed there was changes on a daily 
              basis so i just kept at it until one day i realized i could eat 
              the muffins, then a raw salad, raw fruit, whole nuts and was fine. 
              I used Rowassa suppositories for a month or so. I find them VERY 
              helpful in stopping the feeling of urgency. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hang in there 
              this diet does work for colitis it just might take longer. If your 
              not anemic the blood and mucus is not a big deal. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you're anemic 
              start eating liver. Buy organic no hormone or antibiotic chicken 
              livers. Empire kosher is a good brand. When took Predinsone all 
              the time it would take the predisone the same two months to completely 
              stop the blood and mucus so I figure why not use food to really 
              heal the gut in that amount of time! </font></p>

              Carl, 
              <br>
              For me the ONLY thing that broke my flare was the diet, as I had 
              reached the point of no return, where the drugs are no longer effective 
              and the only thing left is surgery. If the pharmaceuticals could 
              only bottle the diet, it's power would finally be recognized. <br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carl, <br>
              the ONLY thing that has worked for my 11 year old daughter Hannah 
              is the SCD diet. We have been doing this SCD thing for about a year, 
              and she leads a normal life with no restrictions on any activities, 
              with the exception being what she eats, and she is used to all that 
              now. But a few months ago she had a flare-up. She has never been 
              on meds, but our MD was prepared to send us to a pediatric GI to 
              start them if the flare-up didn't stop. He supported my decision 
              to try the introductory diet as outlined on page 51 of "Breaking 
              the Vicious Cycle" for four days. If there was no improvement within 
              that time frame, we were off to see what else would work. We started 
              the intro diet on a Monday, and saw a turnaround by Tuesday. We 
              saw the Doc. on that following Friday and he was VERY impressed 
              with how well she was doing. In hindsight, I think I could have 
              possibly stopped the flare-up in it's tracks before she became miserable 
              if I had jumped on the intro diet immediately. But you know, I forgot 
              about that part of the diet until some blessed soul mentioned it 
              on this site and I went back to the book, looked it up and implemented 
              it. Now I keep a container of the chicken soup with pureed carrots 
              in it in the freezer in case we have to quickly revert to the intro 
              diet again. Also, the yogurt seems to be a "miracle" food. I don't 
              know if it will work for you, but it is certainly worth a try. God 
              bless! <br>

              Weaning meds <br>
              Date: Sun, 19 Mar 2000 <br>
              From: Nancy Wuestefeld</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Hi all, <br>
              I just wanted do a little reminding to some of the new list members 
              that we DON'T advocate stopping all meds cold turkey and substituting 
              the SCD only. Some of us are on some meds that will bring on a flare 
              if this would be done.(i.e.. the dreaded Pred.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am presently 
              on 100 mg of 6 MP a day. When I started the SCD in Nov. of 1998, 
              I was on 150 mg a day and was taking 2 tabs of Asacol 3 times a 
              day. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The doc weaned 
              me off the Asacol first. No problem. GREAT, as a matter of fact, 
              that's 6 less pills a day! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then he started 
              weaning the 6 MP. We went VERRRRRRY slowly with that too. Only 25 
              mg (a half a pill) less for about 3 months, then another 25 mg less 
              for another 3 months... He explained to me that with the way the 
              drug is built up in the body, it would take a good six weeks at 
              least to tell if the lower dose will bring on a flare. I started 
              having a flare just about exactly 6 weeks after I'd gone down to 
              the 75 mg level. I went back up to 100 mg. a day and it took about 
              8 weeks for the diarrhea to slow back down considerably. I might 
              try another wean in about a year, but for now, I think this is where 
              I'll stay till my gut heals a little better on the SCD. (I have 
              Crohn's) </font></p>

              Ditto for me, I was browsing (lurking) on the same newsgroup and 
              saw the same sort of sprinkling, this Feb., 22 months into my flare. 
              I had seen reference to the "Gottschall diet" and SCD on some old 
              homemade IBD websites, and it sparked my curiosity. As soon as i 
              hit the <a href="http://www.scdiet.org/">scdiet.org</a> site I got 
              very excited and super curious to try it whole hog. For the life 
              of me, I can't imagine why anyone would not want to at least *try* 
              it. It takes a lot more perhaps to perservere if you doin't get 
              initial quick results (I haven';t but I believe in it enough not 
              to see any value in reverting, esp as I basically know it has helped 
              somewhat, and even something is better than nothing). Best-- Christopher

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear friends, 
              <br>
              It has occured to me recently that some might benefit from a different 
              perspective on time and the elimination of symptoms. I have seen 
              numerous newcomers to the diet jump right into trying to eliminate 
              every one of their symptoms by eliminating some guilty food. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It seems to 
              me that much of this smarts of the same old societal tendency to 
              want instant results. One reason many people can't use this diet 
              is that they are too impatient to either put in the time in cooking, 
              or wait for the results. And those results are unlikely to be instantaneous, 
              or even anything other than SLOW, in coming. Medication may bring 
              relatively quick results, much of the time. This diet is likely 
              to take quit a while. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, 
              I have been on this diet for 1 year and 5 months. I still have occasional 
              loose stools, though it's gotten to the point where I don't really 
              call it D, because it's usually only 1 or 2 events, and then is 
              back to solid. But still, after almost a year and a half I'm still 
              in a stage of gradual improvement. I often remind myself that BTVC 
              itself predicts that it can take 2 years to get to being symptom 
              free. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have reached 
              the point where I think about sypmtoms on a weekly basis, rather 
              than daily, but still I work to improve. Occassionally I find a 
              food which it is beneficial to reduce or eliminate - honey and excessive 
              fruit are in that category. But mostly I find that I can try to 
              fool around with eliminating things, and not get nearly the results 
              that come simply from being patient. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This takes time 
              folks, and it's so worth the investment. If you can speed things 
              up that's great, but you'll probably end up having to be patient 
              anyway. I'm sure there will be those who disagree, but I still think 
              patience has been my best policy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks for "listening."

              <br>
              Hello everyone, I'm new to the list and have been on the diet for 
              the past 12 weeks for my CD. Right now, the only of "bad stuff" 
              in my diet is a bit of sucrose in one scoop of Questran that I have 
              had to take every day since my resection in '92. (I haven't figured 
              out a way around it... yet) Other than that, I follow the diet religiously 
              and I cannot believe what a difference the diet has made in my overall 
              health. The pain in my lower right quadrant has disappeared, along 
              with the daily diarrhea and overall fatigue. My doctor is very supportive, 
              in fact, he said "if the diet works for you, stay on it...no reason 
              to get off a winning horse". And so, I feel like I am in the Preakness 
              of Intestinal Health!! Thank you to Elaine for writing the book, 
              and thanks to all on this list and the site for their information 
              and support. <br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks Elaine!! 
              I don't know if anyone remembers, but about four months ago I wrote 
              to the list requesting suggestions for my severe anemia (my hemoglobin 
              was down to 8.5). My doctor had me on double doses of iron pills, 
              and was very concerned. Elaine told me to stop the pills and stick 
              with the diet. Someone else suggested that I try liquid liver extract. 
              My doctor had me eating ground beef patties every night! I have 
              done all of these things... and... It has been a long, slow process, 
              but as today my blood levels are totally normal!! I am totally thrilled 
              and just wanted to say, "THANK YOU ELAINE!" I've been on the SCD 
              for five months and have made so much progress. My joint pain is 
              gone as are my horrible skin rashes. Unfortunately, I've also gained 
              15 pounds that I don't need (can't figure out why... my only carbs 
              are from veggies, 1 slice lois lang bread/day and ½ cup of yogurt)... 
              still need to work on that! I'm also more active than ever, lifting 
              weights, running and doing yoga! I love the SCD, Elaine and all 
              of you! Don't know what I'd do without you! <br>

              </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              This is my testimonial for the SCD. My undying gratitude to Elaine 
              for her work. I have a very nice life now, because of that little 
              blue book. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My diagnosis 
              was for a mild case of Crohns, what I always thought was a twice 
              yearly case of the stomach flu, which then became too frequent. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was diagnosed 
              the Christmas of 1995 and put on 5-ASA, which made me very ill, 
              so I quit it. After hospitalization for a blockage several months 
              later, I was on prednizone from June until January 1997, at which 
              time I changed over to budesonide. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had found 
              the book BTVC in a health food store on Yonge Street in Toronto 
              right after my diagnosis but was discouraged by all the restrictions 
              at first. I finally started the diet in the Fall of 1996, becoming 
              progressively sicker as time passed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In September 
              1997 I was too sick to work, and was afraid that the Crohns was 
              worsening as I now had D. Images of surgeons' scalpels danced in 
              my head. I remembered how my symptoms were originally and realized 
              I felt worse than I had when first diagnosed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All this time 
              I continued on the diet almost mindlessly. I really don't know why. 
              At the same time I went to my dentist, who, shocked at how bad I 
              looked, checked on the drugs in her directory (don't know the name) 
              and lo and behold, all the horrible things I had been dealing with 
              were listed as side effects. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concurrently 
              my GI thought it was time to see how things looked and I had a barium 
              x-ray. The results: no sign of Crohns whatsoever, no stricture, 
              no scarring. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I came off of 
              the drugs as quickly as I could and the rest is simply a story of 
              regaining my health slowly. I have never had another episode of 
              Crohns. The drugs actually gave me the symptoms, even though the 
              real thing had in fact been cleared up by the diet some time before. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It took a long 
              time to recover from the fatique, allergies, etc. that resulted 
              from the toxic drugs and even longer to recover from the emotional 
              damage. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks to the 
              SCD the fear of Crohns no longer dominates my life. I might add 
              that now the diet dominates my life (in a nice way). I have been 
              on SCD since 1996 and don't intend to ever leave it. I don't make 
              a fuss when I'm at someone's house, but other than that, I stick 
              to it about 95%. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I found the 
              SCD site after I was through the worst, but check in regularly because 
              I love to see other people getting better with the diet. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I continue to 
              check in with my GI, who asks me how I'm doing. I tell him I'm still 
              on the SCD and doing great. He has told me he has other patients 
              on it who do well too. I just wish he had mentioned it to me himself. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My mother lost

            <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello SCDers, 
              I discovered Elaine's book in 1996 after hearing her interviewed 
              on the CBC Vicki Gabreau's show. I tried it for a couple of weeks, 
              and had such success, I adopted it wholeheartedly for a year. It 
              changed my life. My friends remarked that the colour that had returned 
              to my complexion and when the dehydration was no longer a battle, 
              I could enjoy the hot weather again. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, a 
              stressful time with family health triggered another attack. I knew 
              what I had to do to get things under contol, but this time I noticed 
              an additional pleasant experience. Under normal conditions, I find 
              cooking a little daunting- so much choice, so little inspiration. 
              Now that I am back working with a finite number of ingredients, 
              I find my creativity blossoming. I look forward to experimenting 
              with the allowable ingredients to find new combinations or "faux"

              for giving me the tools to take control of an perennial problem, 
              and a reason to eat more nutritiously. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would like 
              to contact other people on the diet in the City of Toronto who are 
              interested in forming a monthly Pot Luck Dinner Club. We could share 
              stories, swap recipes, taste each others food, and eat with abandon. 
              Can you help me in contacting people, preferrably in the downtown 
              Toronto area, so that I can start rounding up interested people. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So nice that 
              all this is on a Web site now. It's encouraging to see so many people 
              in so many locations have discovered the diet. When I was on it, 
              I never met another soul who was following the same regime. The 
              new world of communications is a great way to get in contact with 
              kindred spirits. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'd love to 
              hear from anyone in Toronto who would like to join me in setting

              I am new to the list and would like to introduce myself. My name

              didn't really disrupt my life much. In Feb. '98, after beginning 
              a course of antibiotics, the disease became much worse, and I ended 
              up with full-blown pan colitis. I was hospitalized twice in 3 months, 
              received blood transfusions, and was extremely miserable and fearful 
              of where this experience would end. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a book 
              called "Breaking The Vicious Cycle", that I had repeatedly seen 
              in the book stores while I was browsing. The author claims that 
              if her diet is followed strictly for at least a couple of years, 
              people suffering from Crohn's, Colitis, Celiac's, and other intestinal 
              disorders can become symptom-free...and stay that way indefinitely. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was skeptical, 
              but ended up buying the book a year or so before becoming extremely 
              ill. I tried to follow the diet at that time, but failed. I think 
              it was because of a combination of things. I could not withstand 
              the skepticism of those around me, and all the eye-rolling and negative 
              remarks that made me feel foolish for thinking that something as 
              simple as a diet could help me. Also, my doctor certainly thought 
              the whole thing was a hoax, and he recommended against it. The other 
              reason I think that I could not continue to follow the diet was 
              because I WASN'T SICK ENOUGH!!! I felt pretty good, didn't need 
              any meds, and had no idea how horrible and devastating this disease 
              could be...and would be for me in the near future. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, about a 
              year later I found myself desperately ill, unable to look after 
              myself or my family, and I finally found the motivation to begin 
              the diet seriously and stick to it strictly. I did not know whether 
              or not it would work, but figured that if I ended up having to face 
              surgery, I didn't want to be wondering whether or not I could have 
              avoided it, and saved my colon if only I had given the diet a serious 
              try. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I felt that 
              trying the diet was very low risk. A couple of very well-respected 
              GIs had reviewed it and although they did not endorse it (they said 
              that they felt it needed to be studied under controlled conditions 
              before it could be recommended), they had admitted that it was a 
              balanced, palatable diet. They published a review of "Breaking The 
              Vicious Cycle", in the Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, I followed 
              the diet. I still suffered horribly for the first 4 months that 
              I was on the diet. After that, my bowel began to heal, and I found 
              myself feeling more and more incredibly well, energetic, better 
              than I'd felt in many years (even pre-UC.) Six months after beginning 
              the diet, my GI told me that my colon looked NORMAL. It has looked 
              that way for the past year. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just wanted 
              to pass on my experience to others who might benefit from it. The 
              incredible part about this diet is that it is only a diet. There 
              is no magic supplement, or secret ingredient that someone is making 
              tons of money on. It's just a matter of feeding yourself good food, 
              and putting an end to consuming harmful stuff that most of us eat 
              on a daily basis. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are many 
              others who have regained their health after following this diet 
              as well. Nine months after beginning the diet, I found the SCD list 
              on the internet, where there are about 250 others sharing information, 
              and support to newcomers, and many success stories. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have had Crohn's 
              Disease for 30 years. Recently had 3 Remacade infusions with no 
              improvement (if anything, I felt worse). My doctor scheduled me 
              to see a surgeon for an ileostomy the week before Christmas. After 
              thinking about it, I cancelled the appointment because I knew I 
              didn't want to to anything before Christmas. Also needed to mentally 
              prepare myself. Don't know why I never looked before but one night 
              while looking under Crohn's Disease on the Internet, I found a reference 
              to Elaine Gottschall's book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle. It has 
              only been about 3 weeks but I can't believe the difference it has 
              made. I can eat WITHOUT PAIN! Just on the off chance that the Remacade 
              was finally starting to work, on Christmas Day I had a very small 
              helping of potatoes and gravy, a little dressing and a piece of 
              pie - became bloaty and gassy. Things certainly aren't perfect after 
              this short time but so much improved that it is scary. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although I have 
              had a severe case of UC, after following this diet strictly for 
              6 months my GI told me that my colon looked normal. I have been 
              on the diet for about 18 months now, and since that examination 
              six months into the diet, my colon has continued to look normal. 
              And I feel very, very well. After being so ill, unable to look after 
              my family or myself, the experience of healing on this diet has 
              been so LIBERATING - I can hardly describe it. There are about 250 
              of us on the SCD list, and success stories are frequently shared. 
              I'm certainly not the only one. The diet requires will-power and 
              time, but you could not pay me enough to go off of it. I hope that 
              your daughter will look into it. </font></p>

              <br>
              Dear All, <br>
              March marks the 4th year I've been on the diet. The first year I 
              was not so fanatical in strict adherence because I was unaware of 
              so many hidden ingredients in some products. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also I ate in 
              a lot of restaurants. Before the diet I got so sick I could barely 
              walk, couldn't drive, was in constant pain. While visiting a friend 
              of Lucy's I was fortunate to be able to buy Elaine's book and try 
              it out. It was remarkable at first even with consuming some illegal 
              foods unknowingly. After getting on this list and finding out more 
              I was able to stick with it 100% for the last 3 years. The improvement 
              is incredible! I can't thank Elaine enough. Also, I just received 
              my copy of Lucy's new cookbook. It's really great. Am looking forward 
              to trying the recipes because I had been in a rut, just eating the 
              same old thing. Going through the new cookbook today, my husband 
              and I are drooling! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some unresolved 
              questions: in the beginning I could eat the yogurt but for the last 
              year I have avoided it because it gave me problems. Anyone else 
              have this problem? Any insights as to what is going on? Then there 
              was the time I got convinced that maybe I had yeast so I began eating 
              raw garlic squeezed on foods. Again, BIG problems with pain and 
              bloating. Fresh lemon juice can do this to me also. I don't have 
              bleeding and never did so didn't think these things would cause 
              a problem. Any insights? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, thank 
              you so much Elaine! You have given me back my life. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Dear Fran, 
              <br>
              Before getting on this list, I would often wonder "what's going 
              on out there!" I would hear from people about twice a week but I 
              knew there must be a lot I didn't know. Today has been remarkable. 
              I'm getting reports - good ones from every direction. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't know 
              why lemon juice would bother you but thank goodness you have identified 
              this idiosyncracy. As I have said before, some very sick people 
              with Crohn's can consume more than a quart of homemade yoghurt per 
              day and thrive; others are bothered. Have you tried the culture 
              <a href="http://www.lucyskitchenshop.com">Lucy</a> sells with the 
              maker? It makes such wonderful yoghurt and you always have it on 
              hand rather than the containers you have to buy and try to keep 
              fresh. Again, thank you for your letter.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Been meaning 
              to post this for a while. Now I am finally moved in to my new house 
              (which I bought - the first) and am catching up a little on the 
              list. I'm WAY behind, and I still have lots of boxes to unpack, 
              so I probably won't totally catch up soon. But, I'm getting there. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for the success, 
              I have finally gotten back to drinking the 3 quarts of water a day 
              that I think my body needs. My doc (who I never see anymore) once 
              told me that having had a resection my body absorbs water less well. 
              He thought that meant I should drink less water (this was years 
              ago, and even then I knew I felt better when I drank more) because 
              it wouldn't be absorbed. However, for the last few months I've been 
              fighting off a mild backslide into symptoms I hadn't had for a while 
              before that. In the last week or so, since getting back to drinking 
              my 3 quarts ago, these symptoms are GONE. I'm having the best, most 
              consistent BM's since before I was diagnosed, 11 1/2 years ago. 
              WOW!! Now, you might claim that being a teacher on summer vacation 
              could have more to do with it than the water intake, but my stress 
              level has not exactly been lower these last few weeks. Quite the 
              contrary, I've been moving, and this Monday I had the worst day 
              of stress in years. <font color="#999999">[story about previous 
              landlord removed]</font> I credit getting back to drinking all that 
              water. I just feel better in general, but having consistently brown 
              and solid BM's is a major step. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almost 19 months 
              on SCD, and I keep gettin' better. I'm getting to the point where 
              I can't imagine being much healthier. I think I'm healthier than 
              most of my friends and family, who think of themselves as being 
              in perfect health. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THANK YOU EVERYONE. 
              YOU WERE MY LIFELINE WHEN I FIRST STARTED, AND NOW MY LIFE IS BETTER 
              THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. SCD NOT ONLY CHANGED MY HEALTH, BUT IT CHANGED 
              MY OUTLOOK AND PRIORITIES. I'M A BETTER PERSON FOR HAVING BEEN THROUGH 
              THIS THAN I'D HAVE BEEN IF I'D NEVER HAD CROHN'S. THAT MAY SEEM 
              STRANGE, BUT I REALLY THINK IT HAS BEEN A VALUABLE GROWTH EXPERIENCE 
              FOR WHICH THERE COULD BE FEW SUBSTITUTES. </font></p>

              Date: Sun, 1 Oct 2000 <br>

              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi you all! 
              - I'm Ulla (25 yrs old) from Finland and I just wanted to write 
              a few lines about my situation and to thank you all for being there! 
              I've been diagnosed with colitis ulcerosa in -98 and been on and 
              off medication (mainly Prednisone) since then but with very little 
              help. This spring I was facing surgery (removal of the entire colon) 
              but then, in the nick of time, I was more than lucky to stumble 
              across some information on SCD in the Internet. Soon I got in touch 
              with the few people in Finland following the diet and since then 
              my life has changed dramatically! I've been on SCD for little over 
              3 months now and my condition has improved tremendously. I'm not 
              entirely symptom free yet (not that I'd expect that so soon) and 
              I've had my ups and downs but on the whole I feel like a new person: 
              no cramps, only occassional bleeding and also diarrhea has recently 
              eased up a bit. I'm able to work, exercise, meet my friends and 
              ENJOY my life! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've got indispensable 
              help from Kirsi (I'm sure you remember her) - she has done so much 
              for us SCDers in Finland! Without her help, knowledge and support 
              I wouldn't stand where I stand today. I've been also following this 
              list for quite some time and learning a lot from here. Naturally, 
              my deepest gratitude goes to Elaine for giving me my life back and 
              restoring my faith in the future. I can't even begin to describe 
              in words how GRATEFUL I am to you Elaine!! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then I just 
              have a few questions to ask. Firstly, I'm eating wide selection 
              of SCD legal foods (including raw veggies + fruit, nuts, almond 
              flour) despite my occasional symptoms because I want to ensure a 
              balanced and nutritious daily diet (I'm not taking any supplements 
              cause we have no legal ones in Finland). Could this, in your opinion, 
              risk the effectiveness of SCD in the long run? Ie. will an extensive 
              version of SCD adopted this early either slow down or even entirely 
              prevent SCD from having its full effect on me eventually (be it 
              in 6 mos or 2 yrs)? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secondly, when 
              is the next edition (8th) of BTVC coming out? I can't to wait to 
              get my hands on the new copy! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once again, 
              I wish you all great health + thank you! I hope my condition will 
              continue improving (sometimes I'm still afraid that this won't work 
              for me in the long run - I guess my fears of this illness occasionally 
              overshadow my belief in the diet!) Sorry for being this extensive, 
              <br>
              all the best, <br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To Ulla from 
              Elaine I am filled with joy after reading your letter. Our darling 
              Kirsi is really buckling down. Bless her and you. I can understand 
              your fears because UC and Crohns are really frightening diseases 
              and once we see a light, we are afraid to put too much hope. I wish 
              I had a remedy for that...If you cannot get vitamins in Finland, 
              so be it. Ask Kirsi what she did. She is a walking role model. I 
              remember her saying she had been sick for many, many years - way 
              back - so she is truly an inspiration. Give her two kisses from 
              all of us if you see her. The new edition is in press. But the only 
              differences are the web site additions and email resources. I do 
              not think one will be able to get it from any source for about two 
              months. But if you visit www.scdiet.org, you will be missing nothing. 
              Mike and MIk in Copenhagen have added audios and all kinds of things 
              so feel secure that that site will keep you up to date. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would love 
              for them to put some of the videos on but I am so naive about computers 
              that I can't even imagine being that fortunate. I have told the 
              group before: the world must see and hear the segment where the 
              girl is well as a result from the SCD and is asked why she waited 
              to go on it and then says &quot;WELL, I THOUGHT IF IT WERE ANY GOOD 
              MY DOCTOR WOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT IT!&quot; (It so happens that 
              her Toronto doctor was head of Crohns and Colitis.) It is such a 
              punchline I would love all the world to see and hear it.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keep

              Elaine, Thankyou! <br>
              Date: Sat, 28 Oct 2000 <br>
              From: "Katie" Ktfish@NYcap.rr.com</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi Elaine, <br>
              Now, I want to thankyou, thankyou, thankyou, for giving me my life 
              back. I have only been on the diet for 5 weeks and I feel like a 
              new person. Before I went on the diet I was on the verge of a colostomy. 
              That is what my colorectal surgeon was recommending. I have Crohn's 
              and my colon in the sigmoid and rectal areas is strictured to the 
              point where I can't even be scoped, haven't been able to for 10 
              years. I have had a peri-anal fistula since December of 99 that 
              wouldn't go away and kept abscessing. I have a 5 year old, 2 year 
              old and 12 month old baby. Since December I have barely been able 
              to take care of them, in a lot of pain from fistula, and going to 
              the bathroom 30 times a day. I couldn't wait for the day to be over 
              so I could just rest. I was not enjoying life. Now five weeks later 
              my fistula is almost gone, barely draining. I am going to the bathroom 
              once maybe twice a day, with no pain or difficulty. My bowel movements 
              aren't normal because of the stricture but it doesn't bother me. 
              I am enjoying playing with my children instead of wanting to be 
              left alone. I actually went shopping today, had lunch and did not 
              wonder where the bathrooms were for the first time since I was 12 
              (I am 34 now). I know this is long but I want you to know what a 
              miracle this diet has been for me and how far I have come in 5 short 
              weeks. I am so grateful to you Elaine for making this diet known 
              and researching it etc., and to all the people on the list for their 
              support and info. I hope this doesn't make anyone uncomfortable, 
              but I would like to share this with you Elaine. I knew about your 
              diet from the internet for about a month before I tried it. Being 
              a carbohydrate fiend I was really hoping that I could find something 
              else that would work. I kept praying to God for help and I kept 
              getting the thought in my head that I needed to try the diet, so 
              I did. You are the answer to my prayers Elaine. God bless you. Katie

              GOOD NEWS! <br>
              Date: Thu, 26 Oct 2000 <br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hello Everyone! 
              Just back from my doctor (Dr. Bolte in Manhattan). He is the one 
              who recommended I read BTVC. I have been on a "modified" SCD (no 
              yogurt, no almond flour) for 3.5 months. My intestinal permeability 
              test came back NORMAL today. No more leaky gut! I still have food 
              allergies, but he feels most will resolve over time. This seems 
              to be what everyone indicates on this listserv. I am so delighted! 
              I feel I am turning a corner and finally getting well! I'm still 
              going to get some intestinal parasite testing done, and I am going 
              to try the Ness Enzymes to see if they will further help me (Dr. 
              Bolte is ordering them for me). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this hopeful 
              time, I would like to thank everyone for their encouragement and 
              "tips" over the past several months. You are such a generous and 
              warm group of people. Your responses have meant so much to me. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I especially 
              want to thank you, Elaine, for writing that book! And thank you 
              so much for all the responses you've given me on this listserv. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hope over 
              time I will be able to eat that almond flour, which tastes so good. 
              And perhaps even the yogurt. Lucy, you may be hearing from me yet!

              Subject: It works!!!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello everyone, 
              In the interest of helping, I will abandon any modesty and let loose! 
              I've had Crohn's disease for 25 years, since I was 12. Four surgeries: 
              1) exploratory (1975), 2) resection (1987), 3) resection (1993), 
              4) perforation 1 month after surgery #3 resulting in emergency surgery. 
              One kidney stone (Crohn's isn't bad enough on its own - need some 
              side ailments as well :), and a fistula (those are reeeal fun) since 
              '93. 2 lost careers, yada, yada, yada... </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nothing but 
              watery Diarrhea since 1993. Still treating with the same thing they 
              used 25 years ago - prednisone. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, today 
              finishes up the second week of the SCD diet. After 8 days, things 
              started to "firm" up. In the last few days, I feel almost normal 
              - it's amazing. Not getting up in the middle of the night, etc. 
              The part I'm really looking forward to is getting my "head" back 
              - as you all know, having life revolve around the bathroom just 
              plain "messes you up". From what I've read about SCD, a return to 
              mental "normalcy" is a happy side effect, as well. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first week, 
              my main concern was making the transition without too much hardship 
              (sorry to say, but I'm a bread/pasta FREAK). So the main goal was 
              to follow the diet, even though some things were probably a bit 
              rough so early on. I ate a lot of hamburger (with tomatoes/onions) 
              and a few salads and coffee (got to have some vices!). The second 
              week I realized the diet is excellent and there is nothing lacking, 
              so my concern became to abstain from some of the harsher foods and 
              start healin'. So we cut out the burgers, tomatoes, onions, and 
              salads, and replaced them with chicken (an SCD version of shake 
              'n bake - it's awesome), soft-boiled eggs, and fish. Chicken/fish 
              are much easier for me to digest than red meat. The other thing 
              I find interesting is that I've been eating mild cheddar like a 
              machine and have had NO problems, and I'm as lactose intolerant 
              as they come. Also, for what it's worth, I pretty much do a fruit/juice 
              fast until noon everyday (from the Fit for Life book). After 12:00, 
              I start with the solid foods. This week's goal is to start tapering 
              off the coffee - I only drink 2 cups a day, but whoa to anyone who 
              tries to take them away! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let me thank 
              all of you for your input - I've learned more in 2 weeks than I 
              have in 25 years. And having Elaine here as an active participant 
              is incredible. It's reassuring knowing that there are others going 
              through the same thing. A small example -- I thought I was different 
              because bananas "kill" me - then yesterday I read that they do the 
              same thing to Cori. These similar experiences make us realize we're 
              not alone in this and that we're not all that different. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, I hope 
              this encourages others - I'm so excited, words can't describe it. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks, Jeff

              The excitement in your letter takes me back to the moment I first 
              realized that I'd stumbled on a miracle when I found the diet, and 
              how amazing it felt not to have to devote 90% of my energies in 
              locating the next bathroom. Welcome back to life Jeff, and enjoy.
