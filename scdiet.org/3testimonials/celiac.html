                    November 6, 1996</font></p>
                  <p align=left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear 
                    Ms. Gottschall:<br>
                    <br>
                    After reading not one, but two scathing reviews on your book 
                    <i>Breaking the Vicious Cycle</i>, I want to let you know 
                    that I disagree with both of them, and would like to have 
                    my say in your defense. <br>
                    <br>
                    The reviews in the Canadian Celiac Association newsletters 
                    (Spring and Summer, 1996) are irresponsible and in my opinion, 
                    enough to alarm any starving gluten intolerant soul in to 
                    bypassing your book and robbing themselves of an opportunity 
                    to get well.<br>
                    <br>
                    First a bit about me. After eight years of mysterious symptoms, 
                    dozens of doctors, gruelling, and often humiliating tests 
                    and general misery I discovered I was gluten intolerant. I 
                    probably would never have figures it out if it hadn't been 
                    for my sister.<br>
                    <br>
                    After checking herself into a psychiatric ward in Vancouver, 
                    an observant nurse and doctor deduced that all my sister's 
                    miseries were linked to celiac disease. (A positive biopsy 
                    confirmed that she was indeed celiac.) Because of her history, 
                    my doctor and I discovered that gluten was also the cause 
                    of my maladies. I had no desire to go back on gluten to have 
                    the biopsy done. My doctor and specialist are both aware of 
                    my condition and the decision not to have the biopsy. Since 
                    my &quot;assumptive&quot; diagnosis, there have been two more 
                    positive biopsies in our family. My eight-year-old daughter 
                    has also since been diagnosed a celiac. My gastroenterologist 
                    and I decided the biopsy was unnecessary and unless further 
                    problems developed, she should remain on a gluten-free diet 
                    too.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, for both my daughter, another sister (in Manitoba) 
                    and I, the gluten-free diet did not work. Some symptoms were 
                    arrested, but none of us were thriving and we just weren't 
                    absorbing food. (My sister in Vancouver and a niece in Alberta 
                    have been successful with the fluten-free diet however.)<br>
                    <br>
                    A friend of mine (suffering from M.S.) recommended your book. 
                    She told me that although it wasn't curing her, it was definitely 
                    helping her live a healthier life.<br>
                    <br>
                    To make a long story short, we found the diet (for whatever 
                    reason) to be a godsend. Contrary to J. A. Campbell's point 
                    (#4), &quot;The diet is very restrictive and difficult to 
                    prepare...&quot;, I find all but the pizza recipe (where you 
                    have to squeeze water out of a zucchini a snap to cook) very 
                    easy. The almond muffins are no more difficult to prepare 
                    than any other kind of muffin. (In fact, easier, because you 
                    make the whole thing in one food processor - no dishes, no 
                    fuss.) I can make the yoghurt in my sleep and everyone (including 
                    guests) loves it. As for the zucchini, if I'm organized, I 
                    just let it drain from a strainer for ages and sill end up 
                    with a good pizza.<br>

                    As for not being nutritious, I have never been healthier. 
                    My daughter, once a sickly (often whiney) withdrawn child 
                    with thin heair and dark circles under her eyes is outgoing, 
                    rosy cheeked and happy. Everyone has noticed her thick, shiny 
                    hair. In fact, she ran a marathon in Owen Sound this year 
                    and placed 15th out of 79 children. Last year she ran the 
                    same race (before the diet) and placed 53rd, arrived weepy 
                    and slept all the way home in the car.<br>
                    <br>
                    Tackling the diet is overwhelming to be sure. Anything different 
                    is a challenge. Instead of diving in headfirst, I tried one 
                    recipe at a time. My sister (skeptical of your diet) visited 
                    me last summer and I showed her how to change her kitchen, 
                    shopping habits and cooking. She loved the food but didn't 
                    notice that some of her symptoms had disappeared until she 
                    went home and went back on the gluten-free diet. She is now 
                    back on your diet and happy with it.<br>
                    <br>
                    In #1, in the review by Mavis Molloy, she states that &quot;...it 
                    is both expensive and time consuming to prepare.&quot; Good 
                    food is time consuming to prepare, no matter what kind of 
                    diet it is. As for expense, again good, real food costs more 
                    than convenience food, but I find you need less <i>real</i> 
                    food than what most of us are used to eating to get the right 
                    amount of nutrition. And has she ever priced gluten-free bread? 
                    Rice flour? Not to mention the new gluten free treats that 
                    are being churned out (many fo them heavily-laden with new 
                    and exciting (untested) ingredients?<br>
                    <br>
                    She also says &quot;...that it is unnecessary to eliminate... 
                    starches such as corn, rice, potato, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, 
                    etc.&quot; So far I haven't met any celiacs who don't have 
                    problems with corn, and buckwheat isn't exactly a hit either.<br>
                    <br>
                    The most important fact about your book is totally missed 
                    by both reviewers. It boils down to common sense. I find you 
                    are very careful about explaining why and how things don't 
                    and do work - right down to common sense things like if you 
                    have four muffins at once, no matter what they're made of, 
                    they're not going to work. You'd be amazed at how many people 
                    don't have enough common sense to see why moderation is so 
                    important. If you're not absorbing nutrients it doesn't matter 
                    what your disease is called or who has researched what, it's 
                    time to try something else, before drugs and scalpels are 
                    necessary. As we know, radical surgery and drugs often cure 
                    the immediate problem but open the doors to others.<br>

                    I have been on the diet since January, 1996, still have a 
                    way to go, but my life has changed drastically since. I have 
                    much more enery, cirtually no pain anywhere (before my list 
                    of symptoms was endless) and no longer spend half my life 
                    in the bathroom where my life was literally going down the 
                    drain. I was underweight, had dry pale skin, dull-looking 
                    dry eyes, suffered from hair loss and was generally miserable. 
                    Now I am actively pursuing my art interests (something I always 
                    had inside me, but didn't have the energy or drive to tackle 
                    it.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Had I seen and heeded the alarming &quot;Celiac Beware&quot; 
                    headline in the CCA Newsletter before I tackled &quot;Breaking 
                    the Vicious Cycle&quot;, I'd be too tired to even write a 
                    letter like this.<br>
                    <br>
                    Feel free to use my letter (or me for that matter.) There's 
                    enough unnecessary suffering out there and there is nothing 
                    to lose by trying this book. <br>
                    Sincerely<br>
                    <br>
