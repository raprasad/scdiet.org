                    Date: Tue, 11 Apr 2000 <br>
                    From: Nancy Emerson</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
                    </font></p>
                  <p>
                  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you 
                  for asking for our stories and experiences with Crohn's disease. 
                  A greater number of available treatment options would be likely 
                  to result in more people being able to live healthy lives despite 
                  this disease. It is important that we find as many avenues as 
                  possible for making information available. </font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was 
                    my experience, starting with the time that I was first diagnosed 
                    with Crohn's (as a 17 year old senior in high school, almost 
                    12 years ago) that my GI doctor had no interest in treatments 
                    other than medication and surgery. General management through 
                    diet, or even remote connections to diet, other then the traditional 
                    low residue approach, were not of interest to him. Throughout 
                    my relationship with him, when I suggested that I thought 
                    I felt better when I ate a certain way, or drank a certain 
                    amount of water, he would dismiss the information. While my 
                    recollection is that some of my ideas did prove to be inaccurate, 
                    they were part of my process of learning how to play an active 
                    role in caring for myself. I was not encouraged in this direction. 
                    </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    I was diagnosed I spent just over 3 1/2 years going on and 
                    off prednisone. I took Flagyl a couple of times, briefly, 
                    as well. I then had a resection, which was recommended by 
                    my GI. We did not ask for second opinions. At the time I was 
                    not losing weight, though I was not responding to the prednisone 
                    as I had in the past. No other treatment options were discussed 
                    or explored prior to surgery. I did have an active fistula 
                    which was not healing. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    the surgery I returned to what I thought was remission. I 
                    was healthy enough to live my life in what I thought was normal 
                    fashion. The disease was inactive enough that I was not prevented 
                    from pursuing activities I wanted to pursue, though I do recall 
                    having increased need for bathrooms far more than is normal 
                    in people without Crohn's. I never was even close to as healthy 
                    as I am now. My doctor wanted me to take Asacol based on one 
                    study he had seen which showed that it 'might increase the 
                    duration of a remission'. I felt that this wasn't strong enough 
                    evidence to support my taking medication longterm. I didn't 
                    take it. I remained in the same state of health for almost 
                    5 years. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When I 
                    got sick again I was more sick than I had ever been before. 
                    I lost weight and had very active digestive symptoms. I did 
                    not wish to return to a cycle of being on and off medication, 
                    and feared that it would just lead to more surgery. I also 
                    beleived there had to be a 'better way,' and I felt certain 
                    that my doctor would be no help in helping me find that way. 
                    So I did not return to him, and as a result got more and more 
                    sick. I tried a naturopath briefly, and she helped, but not 
                    enough and I stopped going. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then I 
                    did a little internet research. At that point I had been very 
                    sick for about a year, and I had lost about 25 pounds. (I 
                    hadn't been even close to overweight, and didn't have any 
                    weight to lose.) I found the book Breaking the Vicious Cycle 
                    by Elaine Gottschall, ordered it, and started the diet. It 
                    helped immediately. I wasn't able, however, to make myself 
                    follow the diet completely, and while I stopped getting worse, 
                    I also didn't get better. I felt I was doing 'the best I could' 
                    at following the diet. I think I was following it in about 
                    95% of what I ate, and I knew staying at the same level of 
                    health was not acceptable - I was too sick. I got discouraged 
                    and went off the diet after about 4 months. At that point 
                    I was desperate, and I started seeing some doctors. I saw 
                    an allergist who did some tests, which weren't very helpful, 
                    but he did recommened following the Specific Carbohydrate 
                    Diet (SCD), as described in Elaine's book. I saw my family 
                    doctor who was clearly scared by my condition and he insisted 
                    I see a GI. I saw a new GI, who was very skeptical about the 
                    SCD, and who wanted to start running tests. I then saw my 
                    original GI, who told me I was not taking care of myself, 
                    and that I was being entirely unrealistic about thinking that 
                    any diet could help me. I needed medication and tests to determine 
                    how sick I was, and I was clearly not living in reality if 
                    I didn't realise this myself. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I guess 
                    those responses, while very frustrating, caused me to realise 
                    my options. I didn't like what any of my doctors had to say, 
                    but I knew that if I couldn't solve the problem myself I would 
                    have no choice. I also knew that the healthiest I had been 
                    was when I was on the SCD, even if it was only 95%. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I restarted 
                    the SCD, after being off it for 2 months. This time I had 
                    much more resolve, as I knew what the alternatives were going 
                    to be. I followed the diet 100%, with no exceptions, ever, 
                    and I started feeling better within days. I began putting 
                    weight back on, slowly, within weeks, and in less than 6 months 
                    I had regained all the weight I had lost. I've since gained 
                    more, but I feel healthier than I ever have before in my life. 
                    Perhaps I was this healthy in childhood, before I really remember 
                    the details, but I certainly haven't felt this good since 
                    before my diagnosis. The years after surgery didn't even come 
                    close. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have 
                    been following the SCD for just over 22 months. I still have 
                    occasional mild symptoms, and I'm still gaining health. My 
                    improvement at the beginning was noticeable daily, and it 
                    then slowed to weekly. It is now noticeable from month to 
                    month, but it is still definite forward progress over time. 
                    I look forward to eventually living a life which is completely 
                    free of symptoms of Crohn's disease. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I continue 
                    to see a family doctor, though not the one I saw two years 
                    ago. He does bloodwork, and helps me monitor my B12 and calcium 
                    levels. As a result of surgery I will probably always need 
                    B12 supplementation. Also, as a result of prednisone, I have 
                    reduced bone density. I am no longer anemic, for the first 
                    time since before Crohn's disease, and without supplements. 
                    My current family doctor is supportive, at least in that he 
                    recognizes that 'if it works keep doing it'. My only requirements 
                    from a family doctor are that he be willing to work with me 
                    on monitoring bloodwork, and that if I were to end up in the 
                    hospital with an injury or another ailment he would support 
                    my requirement for special food. I would have family deliver 
                    it to me if need be, but I want to know that, if I need his 
                    support, I will have it. </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I do not 
                    see a GI doctor. My GI from early in my illness continued 
                    a near complete lack of interest even after I improved. I 
                    have in my file the letter he wrote to my family doctor claiming 
                    I 'wasn't seeing the forest for the trees' and that he was 
                    extremely worried about my condition as well as the direction 
                    in which I was headed. I returned to see him after I had gained 
                    about 15 pounds and had been on the diet for 2-3 months. He 
                    was not interested. After I thoroughly described my improvement 
                    he reminded me that Crohn's can go into spontaneous remission. 
                    I discussed with him that I was not in remission, as at that 
                    point I still had significant symptoms. The point, for me, 
                    was that I was getting continuously and rapidly better. He 
                    wrote down the title of Elaine's book, but gave me the impression 
                    he did so only because he felt I wouldn't be satisfied otherwise. 
                    </font>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I did 
                    experience the relapse Elaine describes at 3 months, and it 
                    wasn't for another 3 months that I regained those backward 
                    steps. Since then I have improved constantly and steadily, 
                    and expect to continue to do so until no more symptoms remain. 
                    At my current rate I would expect to reach this point after 
                    about 2 1/2 years on the SCD. If it takes longer that's okay. 
                    I will be pleased if I can one day eat foods which are currently 
                    not allowed, but if this doesn't happen it's fine. My health 
                    is more important than any specific food I may miss. Even 
                    if I can add some foods back in I expect that my current eating 
                    habits will continue to define my overall habits and patterns. 
                    I can't imagine any diet which varies from SCD dramatically 
                    giving me this level of health. </font>
