              kept up eating this way, he could very well end up with colon cancer.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;..Sorry 
              if I say this too often but the diet has been wonderful for me. 
              Yes, the diet has helped tremendously. I leave out fructose, lactose 
              and gluten. I don't wake up in the night any more, bleeding has 
              almost stopped, and everything is MUCH better for this UC sufferer.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;..after 
              4 months I can say that my CD symptoms have improved. It is definitely 
              worth a try..&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;..I was 
              still on your diet and I went to the specialist and asked if he 
              would take me off the steroids! ... </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
              disagreed but helped me ease off them anyway. The last day I left 
              his office, he said to me, "You will be back in six months." That 
              was 5 years ago. By religiously sticking to your diet and not eating 
              too much raw fruit, I managed to gain 30 lbs in two years. Getting 
              back the weight I had lost made me feel like a new man. &quot;</font></p>

            <p>&quot;..<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
              I received the book and read the diet, I thought, "No way. Many 
              of the things she says are safe to eat have caused me problems in 
              the past." However, with the encouragement of another person on 
              the diet, and still waiting to be seen by a specialist, I committed 
              myself to follow the diet strictly for one month, the recommended 
              length of time to see if the diet will help. Within a week, I noticed 
              definite positive changes. My abdomen felt weird after eating. Then 
              I realized that I was waiting for the usual digestion pains to come 
              and THEY DIDN'T! By the end of the month, I was symptom-free.</font>.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;..<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Within 
              one month on the diet my pain was gone. In another three months, 
              all my symptoms disappeared. I followed the diet for a year and 
              a half. I now eat what I want and have been Crohn's "free" for about 
              two years. If this diet helped me, it can help anybody. I've referred 
              several other people to the book and they've all had great results.</font>.&quot;</p>
