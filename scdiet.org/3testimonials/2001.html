            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello, I was 
              on 6-MP for 5 years. It took 6 months to work but it worked better 
              than anything else I've ever been on. When I got sick again, the 
              specialist told me it loses it's effect after about 5 years unless 
              they put me on a much higher dose, which can be dangerous. I also 
              had to have my blood taken once a month to check for liver damage 
              I believe. Anyways I still didn't know about this diet at the time. 
              (I was on 2 pills/day, which I think were 50mg. each). It is also 
              very good for perianal disease which is what I had. My opinion is 
              get on this diet as soon as possible and take what medication you 
              need to to get well and give the diet time. I speak from the heart 
              because I now have an ileostomy. <br>

              Subject: Doctor visit. <br>
              Date: Tue, 16 Jan 2001 </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi everyone, 
              I just thought I would report about my first doctor visit after 
              starting the diet. Last time I saw my Gastroenterologist in August 
              I had a perianal fistula draining tons of pus. I was going to the 
              bathroom 30 times a day. Had lost 20 pounds in two months and was 
              in a lot of pain and exhausted. Getting dressed seemed like a huge 
              task. I started the diet at the end of September. Within 8 weeks 
              I had gained back 10 pounds, fistula was drying up, in general feeling 
              fantastic. I stopped taking my asacol the third week into the diet. 
              I cancelled my next doctor appointment but made another one for 
              after the Holidays. I ordered three copies of breaking the viscious 
              cycle and brought one with me, as I am sure many of you have done(The 
              other copy is for my colorectal surgeon). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My doctor told 
              me that he had never heard of the diet or the book when I showed 
              it to him. He is a wonderful caring doctor so I believe him. At 
              first he gave me the line of if it works for you than keep doing 
              it. Then as he looked back over my records and realized how sick 
              I had been he seemed more and more interested. I briefly explained 
              the concept to him and he was intrigued. He looked at the area where 
              I have the fistula and said that it has never looked better and 
              he was very impressed. He said that he would like to show his partner 
              the book. Then when the nurse came in he explained to her how sick 
              I had been and that the diet had done wonders for me. He also ordered 
              some blood work for me because I was anemic last time I was there. 
              He asked me if I had taken the iron and prenatal vitamin he had 
              ordered. I told him that I had taken the vitamin but not the iron. 
              He said that he would bet my blood work would be fine since I was 
              doing so well. I can't wait to get the results. I gave him the book 
              with my number in it and he said that he would give it to some of 
              his patients that weren't responding to conventional treatments. 
              I asked him to at least tell people about it. He said that the down 
              side is that a lot of people will not follow the diet, that he could 
              give them the diet tell them that it works and that they will not 
              follow it. He said that he has a lot of celiac patients and that 
              they know if they don't eat gluten that they will be fine. Many 
              still eat the gluten and make themselves sick. I have to agree with 
              him. I am always frustrated when I tell people about the diet and 
              they won't try it. But there are a lot that will try the diet also 
              so I keep trying. Regardless, he seemed interested. My Dr. is William 
              Notis and he is in Albany, NY. <br>
              Katie <br>
              P.S. He wasn't pleased that I stopped the Asacol, but he didn't 
              give me a hard time about it, especially since I was doing so well. 
              I said why take something if you don't feel sick?</font></p>

              for me. I've had UC since 1995 and been on med. ever since. 1998 
              I was hospitalized 6 weeks. I was a mess. Thanks to SCD I am well 
              now and the doctor is reducing my med. I was so impressed by BTVC 
              that I found a publisher in Germany who would publish the translation, 
              with Elaine's consent. I finished the translation a few weeks ago 
              and it will be published around June 2001. Thank you Elaine ...

              explain it to him. I didn't know what his response would be but 
              he was very receptive. In fact I asked if he would read it if I 
              bought it for him and he smiled and said yes. Yeah! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He's been wanting 
              to put me on 6MP so I could get off the Prednisone but yesterday 
              told me to keep up the diet because it's working, to slowly get 
              off the Prednisone and to hold off on the 6MP. He was really impressed 
              with my progress. </font></p>

              I'm into my third day on SCD, and I can finally see for myself what 
              everyone is raving about!! I have had two blissful days of NO cramping/bloating/gas/loose 
              BMs!! (Admittedly, I wasn't all that bad as far as symptoms went 
              before Friday, but nevertheless, I never felt great at the end of 
              a day). I've been eating an egg for breakfast, and then chicken 
              soup, grape jelly (I used to hate jelly, but this is yummy! Nice 
              and tart), a bit of yoghurt (about two tablespoons per day - no 
              problems so far) , and some fish and ground beef. Have some cheesecake 
              in the oven at the mometn, so that will expand the repertoire somewhat!</font></p>

              the minutes until I could leave this playground. </font></p>

              the bathroom and climbing the castle with my kids and pushing them 
              in the swings and enjoying life. Thankyou isn't really enough. But 
              I don't know what else to say. I am just so grateful. Katie</font></p>

              a 85% failure rate, and that Crohn's is a lifelong disease, I began 
              to loose hope for a normal life. Before beginning the sc diet, I 
              was sick every day for two weeks. Since I began, I have been sick 
              one day in two months! (And I've cut down my drugs!) I have no more

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well said. Today 
              is my first anniversary of being on SCD. When I think about how 
              ill I was a year ago, and how depressed and overwhelmed I felt, 
              I have trouble believing it was me. A year ago I believed all the 
              stats listed by the CCFA - three quarter of all Crohn's patients 
              will require surgery in their lives, and of those two thirds will 
              require at least a second surgery. They may be correct, but I won't 
              be one of those people. SCD has given me back control over my illness.. 
              and now the only choice I have left to make is whether to be on 
              the diet or not. Given that I no longer spend 3 or 4 hours in the 
              bathroom a day, I can eat without worrying about losing it one way 
              or another an hour later, I'm not double over in pain and exhausted 
              all the time, and I'm not losing body parts - it's not a hard choice 
              to make. I can't imagine complaining.. Elaine has given me hope, 
              and put my life back in my own hands.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi everyone, 
              My name is Annie. I am just approaching my one year anniversary 
              on the SCD diet and I thought I would share a bit with you. I was 
              diagnosed in April of 1999 with UC. Even though that was the official 
              "start" of my disease, I realize now, I had, if not UC, then really 
              irritable bowel, for many years before that. I had just convinced 
              myself that explosive D was normal for me. Well, anyway, I did seven 
              months of prednazone as well as Asacol, and went into remission, 
              if that's what you want to call it. Someone pointed me in the direction 
              of Elaine's book in September of 1999. It made complete sense to 
              me but it seemed so difficult at the time. There was so much to 
              give up and I was sure I didn't have the will power. After all, 
              I was in remission and that was only slightly worse then what I 
              considered normal. But then, I had my first major flair in January 
              2000. And I mean major. I lost 20 pounds in 3 weeks. I begged my 
              husband to put me out of my misery. He kept trying to convince me 
              my two year old needed me. But all I could think of was he would 
              be better off with a healthy Mom, who could get off the toilet and 
              have the strength just to play with him. When I called my DR and 
              begged to be put back on the prednazone, his associate asked "how 
              many flair ups a year do you have?" The thought had never occurred 
              to me that I would have more than one a year. That was when I started 
              SCD and I have never looked back.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Consistently 
              over the past year I have put on the weight I had lost. And have 
              gotten stronger with more energy. I am not symptom free. But I feel 
              better than I have in years, quite literally. I can take a hike 
              or travel some place without the constant worry of will I find a 
              bathroom in time. My weight does not fluctuate 5 to 10 pounds a 
              day. My stomach is not swollen or loudly gurgling at all the wrong 
              moments. Most importantly, my child has a mother back. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm not saying 
              I haven't had my temptations. I'm sure just like the rest of you, 
              the holidays were very difficult. But I just have to think of the 
              alternative and I can resist anything. I never want to be as sick 
              as I was in January and I'll do anything to make sure I don't. I 
              do not want to do drugs for the rest of my life, that makes me feel 
              old. And most importantly I do not want to ever have surgery, I 
              like my colon, thank you. I do not feel like I am deprived anything 
              on this diet nor do I miss the old lousy foods I used to eat. For 
              I have gained so very much, my health. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have my life 
              back. I am not tied to a toilet. I feel and look great. Thank you, 
              Elaine for showing me I can lead a normal life. I wish you all the 
              strength and the will power to stay on the diet. I wish you all 
              health and happiness. And I look forward to many more anniversaries 
              on this fantastic diet. much love, Annie </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My name is Samantha. 
              I am 16 years old and I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease in March 
              of 2000. In about November of 1999 I started getting very sick. 
              I had flu like symptoms and after about a month of that going on, 
              I finally went to my normal check up doctor. She had no clue what 
              was wrong with me. I soon went to a pediatric endocrinologist. He 
              also had no clue what was wrong so he gave me some medicine because 
              he thought I just had an infection that never went away. I soon 
              started getting even sicker. I couldn't keep anything I tried to 
              eat down. Finally, in March of 2000 I went in for a colonoscopy 
              and endoscopy. That is when they relized that I have Crohn's Disease. 
              I was then put on numerous pills. I was up to about 15 pills a day. 
              I was on prednisone which made me balloon up. None of the pills 
              helped. My doctor then told my family and I about the Specific Carbohydrate 
              diet. I was not very happy about the way it sounded since I really 
              liked my sweets and b! read. But, I decided to give it a try. In 
              early June I started it and I have been on it since. I've been on 
              it for almost 7 months and I feel great. I cheat on the diet every 
              once in awhile, but not a lot. I know I will never be able to go 
              back to eating all the bad foods I did, but, it's worth it because 
              I can lead a normal life now and not spend half the day in the bathroom. 
              I would recomend this diet to anyone that suffers from Crohn's or 
              Colitis</font></p>

              the diet. Also, it might be possible to apply some datamining on

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I do more lurking 
              than writing these days, but we just finished with Matt's checkup 
              at his GI and I want to say a hearty AMEN, HALLULIAH, AND PRAISE 
              THE LORD! The doc was very accepting of the fact that we had weaned 
              Matt off the meds, was happy that Matt was doing so well, and told 
              me to keep doing whatever it is we're doing. He wasn't going to 
              endorse the diet of course (you know, a scientific study of this 
              is impossible, blah, blah, yadda, yadda). I had grabbed the book 
              on my way out of the door and took it out of my purse when he asked 
              about it again. He flipped through it without really looking at 
              it, but just the fact that he is at least supporting me in our choice 
              to maintain this remission with diet is such an encouragement for 
              me. Matt's weight has gone up a bit, his color is good, doctor felt 
              his stomach and said it feels very good. Ended his &quot;stomach 
              check&quot; with a hearty little slap on Matt's belly, surprising 
              Matt and causing him to sit up. It was quite funny! He said to come 
              back in a year and hopefully that we won't have to be calling him 
              for any medications. Only things I'm wondering about is he didn't 
              take any blood this time to check sed rate or iron levels. He explained 
              that he feels that whether Matt is symptomatic is a better indicator 
              of his condition. I wonder if this means he has a lot of confidence 
              in the diet, or does it mean he's blowing us off? Well, no matter. 
              Thanks to this great list and to you Elaine for being a warrior!..........................Lisa

              and am returning to more normal BM. I've learned my lesson. A few 
              meals of grains and starches is not worth weeks of pain. I was amazed 
              at how quickly the symptoms came back. It's just not worth it! No 
              food tastes that good. During flare-ups, I've found that I don't 
              tolerate fiber at all, so I stick to the starter diet plus homemade
