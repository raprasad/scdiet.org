              Subject: <b>Re: HELP</b> <br>

              <br>

              <br>

              Dear Steve, <br>

              I don't usually correspond, I'm more of a silent member of the group, 

              but after reading your message I feel compelled to respond. I'll 

              tell you a little bit about myself and my history with Crohn's Disease. 

              I was diagnosed at the age of fifteen (I'm now 21) and much to my 

              surprise because I didn't feel I was &quot;dealing&quot; with anything 

              by any stretch of the imagination. I thought it was &quot;normal&quot; 

              to be slightly fatigued and have boughts of diarreah which were 

              few and far between. A colonoscopy soon showed I actually had extensive 

              Crohn's all the way through the digestive tract and was anemic (which 

              was causing the fatigue as a result of malabsorption and chronic 

              bleeding - sometimes the blood loss can be so small over such a 

              long period of time that we don't notice it.) </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Anyways, I 

              more or less grumbled along without taking the drugs for about a 

              year and then resorted to the horrible stuff - worst of all the 

              prednisone. During all of this the SCD had always been surfacing, 

              but I never really took it seriously, fooling myself with the reasoning 

              &quot;I'm just not sick enough&quot;. What I'm about to tell you 

              next, makes me wish I had taken the SCD sooner and embraced it as 

              the foundation to intestinal health that it is. In my last year 

              of high school, I had a SEVERE exacerbation of my disease. I ended 

              up in the hospital for a total of six weeks on TPN (kind-of like 

              an intravenous feeding to give the intestine rest), MAJOR doses 

              of prednisone, and the horror of surgery hanging over my head. <br>

              My GI at the time felt that a complete colectomy (meaning having 

              a pouch) was the only solution - without it I would deteriorate 

              more and put my life in jeapordy is what he thought. I had never 

              been so scared, but you can understand, as a young person, I was 

              determined to leave no stone unturned in order to avoid &quot;the 

              knife&quot;. I talked my GI into letting me go home and and do nasogastric 

              feeding (every night I would insert a tube through my nose, down 

              my throat, and into my stomach to feed myself with liquid stuff 

              much like Boost or Ensure), this in itself was horrible but still 

              better to me than surgery and the pouch. This feeding sort of masked 

              the symptoms of CD and then when I started to try to eat normally 

              (still not smart enough to try the SCD, because there was no arguing 

              that now I categorically was sick enough!) I was TERRIBLY ILL, couldn't 

              leave the house as I needed a bathroom literally 24 hrs/day and 

              now I was extremely underweight. Words cannot express how miserable 

              I was. <br>

              </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FINALLY, with 

              the help of my parents I started the SCD. It's been 2 1/2 years 

              since I made the commitment and I haven't looked back, I consider 

              it my lifeline. It truly has given me my life back. My days are 

              happy and fulfilled and best of all I'm physically entact. I'm not 

              scared anymore of surgery because I have the best prevention of 

              that in the SCD. <br>

              I know I've been rather long-winded and I don't want to scare you 

              I simply think you should see a professional, find out what is going 

              on and if your official diagnoses is IBD, then I cannot more highly 

              recommend the SCD. It's non-invasive and works - I'm living proof. 

              <br>

              All the best! <br>

            My husband has Crohn's disease - about 8 years now. He has been through 

            alot. <br>

            Nine months ago he went on this food plan. We found Elaine's book 

            through a co-worker of mine. He is soooo much better. His last colonoscopy 

            was excellent. There is hope. <br>

              this list for a while and just decided to get on and say something. 

              I was diagnosed with Crohn's when I had horrible gut pains. It was 

              the night before I was to go into the Darrien Jungle in Panama on 

              a missions trip. I has been a wild ride since then, but the diet

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well I have 

              been on this wonderful diet for over 2 years now and I feel &quot;Thank 

              God&quot; cured! I am eating things that I really shouldn't be eating 

              with no adverse reaction. I stuck with the diet 110% for over a 

              year. After that I started to introduce foods real slow and nothing. 

              I was 125 LB. on 12/24/96 and now I am 186 LB. I don't run to the 

              bathroom 12 times a day, I don't feel any pain in my gut, and no 

              bleeding. I am currently eating on a regular basis bread, pasta, 

              rice, milk, potatoes and sugar type foods. I did not just throw 

              all these foods down my throat. First I introduced pasta for a few 

              weeks, then bread, for a couple of moths, etc. <br>

              I recommended a few people to this diet and to this web e-mail list. 

              <br>

              Well as I said I was going to check in every few months. This is 

              the only time I have chance, I am busy with work. <br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have been 

              on the diet for two and a half years and now my UC is 99% in remission. 

              This past New Years I was able to finally drop the small dose (5mg) 

              of prednisone that I had gradually tapered to. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other people 

              have said this, but I want to echo that these diseases hit all of 

              us slightly differently. I don't believe the diet cures UC, rather 

              it helps put/keep us in remission. The only cheating I engage in 

              is to drink coffee, and once a week I may have a sauce that has 

              a little corn starch for thickening or a marinade that has a tablespoon 

              of balsamic vinegar. I consume no pototoes, pasta, rice, wheat, 

              sugar, chocoloate, beer, etc. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To beginners, 

              I would say that you will get used to this restricted diet. A lot 

              of our group have posted some very interesting recipes but I have 

              found that most of these dishes are too time consuming and so I 

              stick to a limited diet of meat, vegetables, fruit, honey, cheese, 

              raisins, nuts, cookies, and the Laing and banana breads. For dessert 

              I have either the ice cream, the carrot cake, or cookies. Perhaps 

              the extent to which you seek variety in the SCD is related to how 

              much you live to eat or eat to live. I guess I have reluctantly 

              but easily settled for the latter. :) </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I agree with 

              others who say they will never go back to the diet we used to eat 

              pre-SCD. So far I have found that I can cheat lightly maybe once 

              a week, but not in any big way such as by eating ice cream or regular 

              Italian food. </font>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Lori,<br>

              Just to empathise with you: I tried the diet twice last year and, 

              like you, was worse on it despite following it religiously. I too 

              lost about 10 pounds and got so thin and weak I had to stop. It 

              was a great disappointment, especially in view of the fact that 

              the diet seems to work for so many. I think I must be allergic to 

              one of the basic foods but I couldn't work out which.</font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I continue 

              to take herbal medicine and have never been on strong drugs in four 

              years of UC. I took Asacol for 1 month and then for two weeks a 

              year later. The second time I proved allergic to it and had to stop. 

              I am wondering about going onto sulfasalazine to get the D under 

              control and reduce bathroom visits from present 12 times per day. 

              Then, maybe I would put on some weight and could afford to retry 

              the diet. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hope you manage 

              to find another way to get back onto the road to recovery, but with 

              CD and in the absence of the diet I know its difficult. I sometimes 

              think a dedicated SCD clinic would be a great idea as starting the 

              diet is so difficult. Except the medical profession would probably 

              rubbish it! </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the way, 

              Rachel, although not on the SCD at present I still read this list 

              for its general UC/CD advice and I really value your efforts. Well 

              done and you should feel proud that you have helped so many back 

              to health. I sometimes feel I would rather lose a limb than continue 

              suffering UC!! IBD blights your life like nothing else, so to be 

              able to help even one person is marvellous. </font>

              </font> </p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi Paula, <pbr>I 

              have been on the diet almost 3 years now...(has it been that long?) 

              wow! and I have UC. I've only been diagnosed for the past 3 1/2 

              years. I would say that the diet works for me. I started the diet 

              when I was having no symptoms and coming down off of some prednisone. 

              I did great for the first 16 months or so. I had a bit of a relapse 

              then which was in August, which always seems to be a hard time of 

              year for me for some reason. Unfortunately, at that time I didn't 

              have the knowledge, belief and patience to stick with the basic 

              diet and gradually wait for my body to heal. I eventually gave in 

              and went running to the doctor after about 4 weeks. I was put back 

              on prednisone. At this low point I questioned the whole diet. Something 

              told me though to stick with it. Someone on this list told me that 

              the road to success is sometimes marked with some setbacks but that 

              the general trend is toward better health. After a bit of a rough 

              late summer early fall episode again this past year things have 

              been smooth sailing. I just stuck to meat, yogurt, nut muffins and 

              well cooked veggies during that time...no lettuce or raw veggies 

              and things eventually got better again. I currently take Pentasa 

              only twice a day which is half of what I should take..I don't really 

              think I even need that but I humor my doctor. I haven't yet tried 

              introducing anything non-SCD because there's nothing that I want 

              bad enough to risk what I have now. I am the mother of 2 boys who 

              need their mom in good condition. They are my inspiration and the 

              reason I stick with it. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My story is 

              not a major success story, as I was not on the brink of having my 

              colon removed, but I believe a success none the less. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have been 

              on this list or it's previous incarnations for 3 years. I mostly

              well for me I get a lot of support from everyone. I miss it when 

              I'm away from it for a few days. I'm grateful for this list and

              </font> </p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I've been 

              on the SCD with fanatical adherence for 1 year and 8 months. I've 

              had 2 relapses in that time. In spite of having this last one which 

              lasted about 1 1/2 months, the results of my colonoscopy were quite 

              good. I went for it a few weeks ago when I was still in a relapse. 

              As badly as I had been feeling the entire month leading up to my 

              procedure, the doctor said my colon was 98% perfect with just a 

              slight inflamation at the end 2 inches. Every time I've mentioned 

              the diet in the past, he rolls his eyes with the usual response 

              &quot;diet has no effect on this condition&quot;. Well this time 

              he said, it looks excellent! Just keep doing whatever you're doing. 

              Well, needless to say I felt very excited. One thing I did discover 

              during this most recent relapse, is that even when just the very 

              tip is irritated, you can still feel really terrible. I began using 

              just the rowasa suppositories just at the tip instead of the rowasa 

              and cortezone enemas that seemed to increase my diarrhea and actually 

              inflame the area more. But that little suppository, right at the 

              very tip, did the trick. Just prior to the colonoscopy, I was getting 

              very depressed, thinking that all my fanatical adherence had been 

              in vain. So to all of you that may be in the throes of what seems 

              to be a never ending relapse, have faith, for sometimes the symptoms 

              can trick you into believing your condition is much worse than it 

              actually is. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and maybe 

              only a slight inflamation at the end of your colon!<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you so 

              much for providing the SCD information on the internet. I have suffered 

              from chronic diahrea since 1986. Last year my digestive system deteriorated 

              to the point that nothing would slow down the diahrea. I was desperate 

              and decided to search the internet for &quot;diahrea&quot;. I found 

              the SCD site. After reading the information, I decided to put it 

              to the test. I ordered the book and begain a basic SCD diet. The 

              diahrea stopped immediately. Here is my story. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I first began 

              sufferering bowel problems in 1986. After six months of tests by 

              a Gastro Intestinal specialist, I finally figured out that eating 

              bread was making me sick. I stopped eating bread and wheat products 

              and was able to survive. My digestive system wasn't normal, but 

              I could get by if I didn't eat wheat products. The GI doctor told 

              me I might have celiac disease. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the years, 

              my digestive system was very sensitive and I would have occasional 

              bouts of diahrea. Periods of stress would make things much worse. 

              I was also suffering from other allergic problems during this time. 

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, 1998, 

              things got much worse. I started having chronic diahrea, that I 

              couldn't stop, even with immodium. I narrowed my diet down to a 

              few basics like vegetables, meat, rice and potatoes, but it didn't 

              help. I didn't know what to do. Out of desparation, I decided to 

              search the internet for anything related to diahrea. I found the 

              SCD site and began reading the information. I decided that it was 

              worth a try. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I ordered the 

              book and started on a basic SCD. Things improved immediately. Instead 

              of having to go to the toilet every fifteen minutes, I now only 

              went once a day. The stools weren't normal, but at least I was getting 

              some nutrition. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 

              to the chronic diahrea problems I had last year, I had other health 

              problems. I lost a lot of weight and began having heart palpitations. 

              Then I started having pains in my arms and shoulders. I went to 

              a cardiologist, but after doing a stress test, he determined that 

              the problem wasn't coronary blockage. He just called it stress. 

              I have always been very active, hiking, racquetball, basketball, 

              tennis, etc. I passed the treadmill test with flying colors. (At 

              that time I was still in pretty good shape. Since then I have had 

              to cut back my activity, but still do some walking and light hiking.) 

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I begain the 

              SCD diet in October of 1998. It is now March, 1999. Because of the 

              other health problems I have been fighting, I decided to work with 

              an MD who goes beyond the standard &quot;cookie cutter&quot; medicine 

              practices. This doctor had me do a stool analysis for bacteria and 

              yeast by the Great Smokey Mountain laboratory in Tennesee. The test 

              identified a bacteria called Citro Bacter Frieundi that has been 

              associated with diahrea and cross immune problems. The test also 

              identified an anti-biotic that could be used to kill the bad bacteria. 

              I took Septra DS for two weeks to kill the bad bacteria. (I just 

              recently completed the anti-biotic 3 weeks ago.) After taking the 

              anti-biotic and then taking pro-biotics, in order to restore good 

              bacteria, I have seen a significant improvement in my digestive 

              system. The stools now appear normal. Before that, even though the 

              SCD diet had stopped the diahrea, the stools were not formed or 

              normal. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am still on 

              the SCD diet. I plan to try introducing some brown rice and maybe 

              potatoes in about a month. For now I'm just excited that my bowels 

              have improved so much. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am still dealing 

              with some strange burning pains that I get in my arms. I have insomnia, 

              and when I don't sleep, I am miserable the next day, with these 

              weird pains. Has anyone else with intestinal problems had weird 

              pains. One of the other things I have done, to improve my health, 

              is have my silver dental fillings removed. I believe that this provided 

              some improvements. The burning pains are much less than they were 

              before, and I don't have near the throat drainage I used to have. 

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, I feel 

              that I'm now on the right path, the SCD diet saved my life, and
