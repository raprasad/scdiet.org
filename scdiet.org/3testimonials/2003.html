              weight is almost where it should be after about 8 years. My husband

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 
              link came through on the other listserve I am on. I loved the way 
              it was written. It is not the first report of recovery using SCD. 
              (link to<a href="http://hometown.aol.com/hopeforautism33/myhomepage/index.html"> 
              SCD and Autism</a>)</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. 
              &quot;...The SCD was the single most important ingredient that led 
              to Maria's recovery. But it wasn't the only one. These treatments 
              also helped:...&quot;</font></p>

            </p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The traditional 
              treatments for IBD are outrageous! I will never go to a GI doctor 
              again unless he/she is one who actually has this condition. Oh, 
              sure, take all these expensive medications each of which has it's 
              own set of side effects, which may or may not be as bad as the disease. 
              Surrender yourself to victimhood and lay yourself on the altar of 
              conventional medicine. OR - follow the SCD diet, modify it as needed 
              to find your own level of comfort. It has taken a few years for 
              me to find my own needs, which are more strict than the SCD, but 
              I eat a reasonable amount of meat-chicken-fish, hard cheese, homemade 
              yogurt, and many raw veggies. I can eat at restaurants (tell them 
              [I am] on the Atkin's diet, everyone knows what that is)...being 
              pain free, diarrhea free is a great motivator. Best luck to all! 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Editor's note: 
              The SCD and Atkins are not the same. The SCD is more restrictive 
              about the types of carbohydrates that are ingested and less concerned 
              about their quantities. The Aktins allows for bread and starches, 
              the SCD does not. Certain aspects of the Atkins may appear similar 
              to restauranteurs, but we see the two diets as different and suggest 
              SCDers to simply &quot;say what you want&quot; when <a href="../4faq/diningout.html">dining

              Rhonda S.<br>
              Date: Wednesday, August 6, 2003</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was diagnosed 
              with Crohn's Colitis 5 1/2 years ago. Six months after the diagnosis, 
              I came to the realization that the medicine the doctor prescribed 
              was not going to &quot;fix&quot; me or even control the symptoms, 
              for that matter. It was taking increased dosages of medicine to 
              maintain a not-so-normal state.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I started the 
              SCD diet because it was the only option I found that offered any 
              hope. At first, I thought it was the end of the world. My pre-SCD 
              diet was almost totally based on flour, sugar, rice, pasta, potatoes 
              - all the bad stuff! No wonder I got sick!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My recovery 
              was not as quick as some in the other testimonials on this site. 
              I saw only marginal results for the first year or so. However, my 
              mother always said I was stubborn - so I stuck with it. I thought 
              about giving up a few times, but each time I ate a complex carbohydrate 
              I felt really bad.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Over the last 
              2 years, I can tell my digestive system gets stronger all the time. 
              After five years, I am just now symptom-free and medication-free.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In that five 
              years, my eating life has been transformed. I never thought I would 
              say this, but cooking has become a hobby (as opposed to eating fast 
              food). I have expanded my horizons to new foods, herb gardening 
              and wine collecting.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My advice to 
              anyone on the diet is: this disease did not develop overnight, so 
              don't expect to cure it overnight. Don't give up, even if you don't 
              see notable results right away. Sometimes being stubborn is a good 
              thing.</font></p>

              on April 8, 2002. Unfortunately, my symptoms got worse before they

              - I am now med-free and symptom-free! It happened sooner than I

              Subject: One year anniversary, thank you Elaine!!! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
              Hi everyone, <br>
              I've been meaning to do this for a couple </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">weeks 
              now and just haven't had the time, it's Eric's one year anniversary 
              on the diet!!! So in keeping with the tradition of the list I'll 
              tell his story, here goes: <br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this time 
              last year Eric was sooo sick that he barely got outta bed, he couldn't 
              work, and we were living with my parents (7 people in a 4 bedroom 
              house). He was diagnosed in January of 2002 with a fistula that 
              went from his intestine to his bladder, this type of fistula is 
              very difficult to heal without surgery, in fact, in all the reading 
              that I did when they told us that that is what he had, it all said 
              that surgery was the only way to take care of it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He had constant 
              bladder infections and as you can imagine with a passage from his 
              intestine to his bladder, he was peeing things that he shouldn't...very 
              painful to say the least. They put him on Remicade infusions which 
              he had reactions to, they put him on 6MP which he also had an allergic 
              reaction to and they couldn't figure out what was going on (long 
              story but it made him very, very ill). All these medications that 
              were supposed to be helping were making him even worse. He had constant 
              D and vomiting and he lost a lot of weight. To make a long story 
              short he was in bad shape. He started the diet in March of last 
              year and today he is doing awesome and has been for quite sometime. 
              The fistula has closed, (something they never thought would happen 
              without surgery which he was on the verge of when he started the 
              diet), he is at a healthy weight, he is symptom free, he is working 
              and has been promoted to general manager, we were able to move back 
              to our <br>
              house...things are just going really, really well. Eric was never 
              this well even when he was in <br>
              &quot;remission&quot; pre-SCD, he never felt good, he threw up and 
              had D a lot of the time but according to the doctor he was in &quot;remission&quot;, 
              and he averaged 2 weeks in the hospital a year. He hasn't been this 
              healthy in years. I have my husband back and he has his life back!!! 
              This is the greatest gift anyone could ever give us! Thank you so 
              much, Elaine!!! And our families thank you too. I also want to say 
              thank you to Rachel, Tanya and all the other old-timers that helped 
              me thru in the beginning, most of whom aren't here anymore...I miss 
              them but I'm very, very happy that they are well and have gotten 
              on with their lives. Elaine, I just don't have the words, you have 
              touched so many lives, you are our angel and there is a very special 
              place in our hearts for you. We could never, ever <br>
              repay you for what you have done for us and thank you just doesn't 
              do it, but thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A year ago and 
              two weeks ago, I was admitted to the ER with an acute case of Crohn's 
              colitis. I weighed 90 lbs., was running multiple fevers in excess 
              of 104 degrees F, had D to the tune of 32x/day, had lost 2 pints 
              of blood and could barely walk.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After eleven 
              days in the hospital, they gave me a choice: I could stay and receive 
              more aggressive drug therapies (the 60mg of IV prednisone they had 
              me on wasn't making a dent); or I could go home and &quot;see what 
              happened&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I went home. 
              The next day, I talked my friend through Whole Foods on his cell 
              phone, making him read me every label on the items I needed to begin 
              the SCD. With the last of my strength, I made the soup and some 
              homemade gelatin. And each subsequent day, I built on the little 
              ground I had already gained until two weeks later, I was able to 
              go to my doctor without lining my pockets with weights to cover 
              the weight loss.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within one month, 
              I was able to do my laundry by myself again. Within three months, 
              I was able to get back to work. Within five months, I was off all 
              of my medications.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past 
              year, I have had one flare, brought on by hormonal birth control. 
              I went on all my meds again, but this time I was able to wean myself 
              off of them in a mere four weeks--I was now that healthy. A year 
              later, I still can't eat raw fruit with abandon but I can travel 
              and not get sick. I haven't had bread or pasta or any other illegal 
              but I can work, socialize and sleep through the night. My world 
              of acceptable restaurants has shrunk even as my ability to be out 
              and about with seemingly boundless energy has increased.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've accomplished 
              things I never dreamed I could twelve months ago. I've helped friends, 
              acquaintances and total strangers find this diet and changed their 
              lives, too. I've learned patience (oh, boy, have I learned patience) 
              and as a result, am more tolerant of quirks in myself and others. 
              This diet didn't just give me back my life; it gave me a totally 
              new one, richer than I ever could have imagined.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So when people 
              tell me how hard it must be to be on this diet with all of its restrictions, 
              I smile and think to myself, &quot;What restrictions?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've never been 
              freer in my life.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you, St. 
              Elaine. Thank you, Rachel. Thank you, all of you wonderful people 
              on this list who get up every day and fight the good fight.</font></p>

              Judi C.<br>
              Date: Sunday, October 5, 2003</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I went on the 
              diet in 1997 after being diagnosed with pan-colitis. After two weeks 
              on the diet my symptoms were drastically <br>
              reduced. After two years on the diet they were gone. I did have 
              a flare in 1999 following a rather tramautic childbirth experience 
              (very <br>
              preterm, emergency c-section) but I went back on the diet. I am 
              allergic to every drug used to treat the UC other than prednisone 
              (which I <br>
              hated) so the diet was my only option.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As a result, 
              I am now UC free! That's right--free! I had a colonoscopy done this 
              year and there is NO SIGN of disease and NO SIGN of <br>
              damage to my intestinal walls. I have no symptoms and haven't flared 
              since 1999. The doctor says I will always carry the diagnosis but 
              that I <br>
              should consider myself disease free. I do think that it was 80% 
              diet and 20% stress reduction (I learned to let things go and to 
              ask for help <br>
              when I needed it and get lots of exercise). Learning to let go of 
              controlling everything around me really eased my symptoms but the 
              diet is <br>
              what cured my body.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Thanks Elaine 
              for helping me get my life back. My husband and my daughters thank 
              you more than words can say!</font></p>
