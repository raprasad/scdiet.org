              <br>

              To all of the SCD subscribers:<br>

              <br>

              I am Jennifer King and I am a 3rd grade teacher in Missouri. I have 

              Irritible Bowel Syndrome and have been diagnosed for 7 years. I 

              found Elaine's diet by talking with a friend whose mother was on 

              the diet. I used to spend all day in the bathroom as many of you 

              have, but my job does not facilitate such an inconvenience. Every 

              time I ran to the bathroom, I basically risked a lawsuit leaving 

              my students alone! <br>

              </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, July 

              1, 1998 will be my one year anniversary on the diet. I have followed 

              it faithfully and my life has changed for the better. I am a nice 

              jovial human being again! <br>

              <br>

              I vowed that I would not do anything to change my diet during the 

              school year, but now that summer is here I have made a few changes 

              and I have not felt the same since. I added bread back into my diet 

              and at first it was great. It was sinfully great. But I have overdone 

              it a bit and I need to get back to the basics.<br>

              <br>

              I am currently taking Elavil (anti-depressant to work as an<br>

              anti-spasmotic), Paxil (anxiety), and Prilosec (for gas.) Does anyone 

              out there take any of these medicines as well as follow the diet? 

              If so, I would like to hear from you. I am having trouble getting 

              motivated to go back to the diet in full force. It is hard once 

              you have splurged a bit. I am so proud of myself for being 100% 

              faithful for 10 months and if you have experienced what I am going 

              through, I would love to hear from you as well.<br>

              <br>

              One more thing, I have been experiencing panic attacks for the past 

              year and a half and I have read about the bowel-brain connection. 

              I was wondering if anyone else could shed the light in this area.<br>

              <br>

              Thanks so much,<br>

              Jennifer King<br>

              <br>

              Well, we didn't write down the exact date or anything like that, 

              but Matt has been on the diet for a year this month. Things are 

              going really well. Even his respiratory problems, which started 

              at the same time as all his other symptoms, have finally all but 

              gone away. He has gained weight consistently during this year. He 

              had lost a considerable amount of weight prior to going on the SCD, 

              not a good thing for a twelve year old to be<br>

              doing. At thirteen he is active, gaining weight, and doing all the 

              things his friends do except that hanging out at McDonald's is pretty 

              out of the questions. Luckily, his friends don't do a lot of that 

              anyway. Thanks to everyone who has been of assistance.<br>

            &gt;> I am curious about how long it was until you noticed significant 

            changes in symptoms, how long it was until you were able to get off 

            medication (if you were in it), and if you plan to stay on the diet 

            for the rest of your life. I also would like to know what foods, if 

            any, that were deemed acceptable for the diet, might have caused problems 

            for you. Did you ever consider surgery?<br>

            <br>

            I started the diet 2 1/2 years ago. I have Colitis. I noticed changes 

            in 2 weeks, which were significant. My swelling went down, my urgency 

            to go went down. I still had some bleeding, which only fully went 

            away for a few 2-3 week periods at a time. MY spirits went way up. 

            It was quite a while after that before I "found myself" at a higer 

            level of remission, it is a slow, slow process. I feel that it took 

            "resigning myself" to being on the diet for psychophysiological changes 

            to occur to offset the frustration and discouragement of being chronically 

            ill. I stopped meds after about 6 months on the diet. I should be 

            on asacol, as a day-to-day maintenence drug which is <br>

            supposed to help you stay in remmision, but I think it increases my 

            bleeding. So I find that I just stop taking it.<br>

            <br>

            I had achieved a level of remission in March of this year that led 

            me to believe that I had "gotten all I was going to get" from the 

            diet. All the mucus, swelling and accompanying urgency to move bowels 

            had disappeared. I had occasinal sporadic showings of blood in my 

            stool, but nothing like what I had experienced before going on the 

            diet. I had long given up any medication. A happy camper, I was. I 

            started "reintroducing foods." I figured corn (in the form of tortilla 

            chips and my own custom corn bread recipe) and rice, and beer were 

            good starting points. Much to my delight, I was able to handle them 

            without any adverse symptoms - at first. I noticed a significant boost 

            in energy, most likely from the carbohydrates, and put an extra maybe 

            7 pounds on, I felt more substantial. Once I started putting ketchup 

            on burger patties, and allowed myself to go out to restaurants, the 

            symptoms started creeping back until -- WHAM! I was having a relapse! 

            Now, 3 weeks later, on 15 mg of prednisone and back on the diet "with 

            fanatical adherance" I find that I'm coming around again. I think 

            if I had tread more lightly, or waited another 6 months, I would have 

            been less succeptiple to having this relapse. BUT - I've learned now 

            that the diet definitely alleviates the most bothersome symptom for 

            me, the constant urge to go. I'm doing rather <br>

            well, I must say. I feel good. But, some of that new-found carbo-induced 

            energy is gone (replaced by the racey steroid induced frenzical state 

            that prednisone puts me in). I expect that I'll be able to taper off 

            the prednisne in another couple <br>

            of weeks, thanks to eating only foods legal to the diet. I'm also 

            back to being sensitive to stuff like grape skins, which are irritating 

            to my stomach, but I don't feel that I'm back to square one by a longshot. 

            If you ar pondering whether or not to take the plunge and do the diet, 

            you would be foolish not to give it a <br>

            shot. It must be done with 100% commitment, from my experience. Treat 

            it like a religion, and you are the high priest.<br>

              Subject: <b>RE: SCD Questions</b><br>

              <br>

              I have been on SCD for almost two years: (1) Acid reflux gone almost 

              immediately. (2) Constipation and D gone after 8 - 9 weeks. (3) 

              I have learned to listen closely to my body. Lately I have been 

              cheating on the diet to see what would happen. So far, I can sense 

              when the food is not agreeing with me (pizza) (chips)etc., and I 

              immediately go back to the diet. It has been a year with no symptoms. 

              But my body seems to say it is not ready yet. If it means that I 

              will have to eat grilled salmon seasoned with Cajun spices, meatloaf 

              made with a combo of turkey, pork and beef (lightened with V8), 

              delicious nut muffins and smoothies for breakfast, pies made with 

              almond flour crust, lasagna made with zucchini - I think I can enjoy 

              it. In fact it seems like a very healthy life choice to me.<br>

            real flare-up for over a year. I told him that is because I have been 

            on this diet for that long. He still does not think that the diet 

            is what has made me feel better. I am by no means completely cured. 

            There are some days that my side hurts, but it is not bad and does 

            not last. I was so glad to released from the doctor after 4 years. 

            I am not on any<br>

            medication, but plan on staying on scd for the rest of my life. I 

            had to share this news with those people who understand how exciting 

            this is. <br>

            <br>

            Dear HLachs@aol.com,<br>

            <br>

            I had the same problem you do. I was usually constipated and sometimes 

            felt as if I had a basketball in my gut, I was that bloated! Off and 

            on this would reverse to D, which many times I welcomed as it gave 

            me relief. Just before going on the SCD, Sept. 27, 1997, I also began 

            bleeding. Another problem was extreme chest pain along with sharp 

            pains around my heart,<br>

            which fortunately ended up to be from my stomach, not my heart. My 

            theory on that was that all the stuff sitting in my intestines, due 

            to constipation, was causing gas to back up into my stomach.<br>

            <br>

            The SCD has helped me become 'regular', which equates to one good 

            bm in the morning. I leave the house for work feeling light and good. 

            I very rarely experience the chest pain or sharp stomach pains now.<br>

            <br>

            I still have to work at it though, because there are certain foods 

            that are allowed on the SCD that give me an adverse reaction. If I 

            have a bad day, I can usually track it back to a particular food, 

            usually some type of fruit.<br>

            <br>

            I have also cheated on occasion and I can declare without a doubt 

            that grains will bring back the constipation immediately and can last 

            for 4-5 days. So breads, pasta, anything with flour in it is harmful.<br>

            <br>

            My doctor wanted me to also try a diet that would be right for my 

            blood type. I have not completely implemented it because combined 

            with the SCD, it restricts me even further. One thing that the blood 

            type diet would allow is corn, which the SCD does not. So my doctor 

            said to experiment, one food at a time if I want. Well, I tried corn 

            (I love chips and salsa). I do not recall having an immediate gut 

            reaction, i.e. constipation, but it<br>

            did bring back my eczema, which some research has shown, the scaly 

            condition of the skin is an outward sign of what is occurring in the 

            intestines.<br>

            <br>

            I can summarize all of this by saying, I have tried the SCD, and I 

            have tested it with somewhat controlled experiments, and my conclusion 

            is, it works! And it doesn't pay to cheat. When I started the SCD 

            I hoped it would be a temporary thing, maybe 2 or 3 years. But I have 

            adopted the attitude that the SCD is the way for me to eat. Since 

            it has made such a difference in my life, I don't look at it as temporary 

            anymore, and I also<br>

            don't see it as restrictive.<br>

            <br>

            I have read that when you continue to eat foods that you are allergic 

            to you will gain weight. I had gained an unwanted 25 lbs. I would 

            also notice, when I was experiencing bloating, I could gain 5 lbs 

            in one day! I have lost that 25 lbs and am back to my ideal body weight. 

            The daily weight fluctuations have diminished as well.<br>

            <br>

            Sorry for making this so long. I hope you try the SCD, and I hope 

            you get the same relief that I have. You will want to be fanatic about 

            it, especially for the first 4 weeks, to see if it is going to help 

            you.<br>

            <br>

            </font>Subject: <b>Hello from Northern B.C.</b><br>

            <br>

            I was diagnosed in April with Celiac. During my first month my Naturopath 

            and I added pancreatic enzymes, plantzymes, Bile, HCL and Pepsin, 

            Carbamide. I am already taking biotin and folic acid, calcium, magnesium 

            etc. etc. Within the first month of gluten free and my new supplements, 

            I felt alot better. <br>

            <br>

            Prior to being diagnosed I lost 20 pounds in 3 months. I now weigh 

            98 pounds and am 5'7". A little bit slim for my liking! As well, prior 

            to April 5th, I was a vegetarian for 2 years as I thought that I was 

            doing my body a favour cutting out the meat. I had problems digesting 

            it but now as I think back it was probably what I ate with it that 

            was causing the problem. For my entire life, I have been affected 

            by digestive and constipation problems and just sort of learned to 

            live with it as "this is me". My energy levels in March 1998 were 

            so low that I was sleeping most of the day and had incredible headaches 

            and stomach aches (especially after eating - in the gallbladder area). 

            I am now a meat & veggie eating-aholic! and have never felt better!<br>

            <br>

            On May 25th I dug out my copy of "Food and Gut Reaction" by Elaine 

            Gottschall that I had purchased about 5 years ago, read, put away 

            and thought that I could never eat like that. As of that date I have 

            been on the SCD. It was about a month after that and I really started 

            to notice the increase in energy. Like wow! Up to May 25th I was feeling 

            OK but new there was still something wrong. I like a few others (notes 

            that I have read on the chat line) dove right in and was eating nuts 

            etc and salads from day one as I didn't really read the instructions 

            properly. Something else that I notices as I reread the book a few 

            days ago was that seeds are not allowed. I've been eating tahini and<br>

            sunflower seeds quite a bit. No more now though. I have a few questions 

            that I was hoping for input if possible. <br>

            <br>

            I still am constipated. I went to see a different ND who told me that 

            at one time in my life, I have had the Epstein Barr Virus (I cann't 

            seem to remember having it) and that the symptoms will be low grade 

            for the rest of my life. He said that this causes improper liver function, 

            therefore poor elimination as well. I was unable to take the homeopathic 

            tincture (barberry) as it made my feel fatigue and have a horrible 

            headache. Have you heard of this and do you think that it could cause 

            the constipation? <br>

            <br>

            I still also have an "Oily substance" that I see in the toilet water, 

            when I go to the bathroom. What does this mean. Could it be from the 

            seeds that I have been eating?? Not digesting the fat??<br>

            <br>

            I have not gained any weight back yet and cannot wait to put it back 

            on. I read some of the info about certain veggies (squash, pumpkin, 

            turnip) that may do it and I will increase this in my diet asap. Any 

            other recommendations? Would eating smaller meals 4 x a day be good?<br>

            <br>

            I was taking a colloidal mineral drink prior to being diagnosed called 

            "Longlife Minerals". It has all 90 colloidal minerals and a few other 

            added nutrients such as nopal cactus, 100% soluable fibre. It is in 

            a base of crystalline fructose, potassium gluconate, magnesium gluconate, 

            citric acid, malic acid, calcium gluconate, zinc gluconate, potassium 

            benzonate,<br>

            potassium sorbate, copper gluconate etc. etc. I think the colloids 

            are good but the base is not allowed on the SCD. Therefore, can you 

            recommend a product that would give me the collodial minerals. Do 

            you think they are a good thing???<br>

            <br>

            Is gray hair (I am 29) caused by my body being starved of nutrients? 

            Will it turn brown again?<br>

            <br>

            What can you do for a prolapsed bowel??<br>

            <br>

            I also have another bit of information that I would like to share. 

            I have just recently read "Eat Right for your Blood Type", by Peter 

            D'Adamo. It is really an interesting book. One thing that fascinated 

            my was that I am a Type "O" and the diet that he outlines for Type 

            "O"'s is very close to the SCD. I am interested to know how many people 

            there are out there that have Celiac etc. are Type "O" people???? 

            The Type "O" is known as the "Meat Eater - Hunter Gatherer" and was 

            the first known blood type for prehistoric man. There is a web site 

            about the "Paleolithic Diet" if anyone is interested. On this diet 

            the individual eats only what the Hunter Gatherer would have ate back 

            then - meat, veggies, certain legumes, certain nuts, no dairy, no 

            grains and no potatoes. The Type "A" came along later when mankind 

            began growing food for agricultural purposes. They Type "A" is the 

            vegetarian and can tolerate the grains and dairy but isn't very tolerable 

            red meat etc. I apologize for dragging on so long, but I thought is 

            was interesting and<br>

            Food for Thought!!!! Hee Hee <br>

            <br>

            I feel really good, the best in years (have been losing weight for 

            about 4 years now). I would like to sincerely thank Elaine Gottschall 

            for writing both of her books and giving me a new life. I also enjoyed 

            the new information about Celiac in "Breaking the Viscous Cycle". 

            I can actually think straight again and have colour in my face! We 

            have been trying for<br>

            children for a few years now and can now hopefully see them in the 

            future sometime. I look forward to helping anyone I can with this 

            information.<br>

            <br>

            I look forward to any of your knowledge when you have a moment!!! 

            <br>

            <br>

            Thank you again!<br>

            I have been on the diet for 2 years with tremendous (perhaps miraculous!) 

            results. I do occassionally enjoy a cigar (every few days) and have 

            done so for years. It was not until I went on this diet that remission 

            occurred. In fact, I was on a serious downward spiral until I started 

            the SCD.<br>

            <br>

            The diet works. Stick with it.<br>

              station, so I left work, going to the bathroom first of course. 

              I walked the 2 blocks to the train station and as I walked up the 

              stairs, IT hit me. I had to go SO bad. As the train approached, 

              I seriously considered throwing myself in front of it to finally 

              put an end to my miserable<br>

              existance. I can actually feel myself standing there swooning, with 

              the train whistle screaming its approach. I always carried underwear 

              with me. I got on the train crying, and went into the 2 foot smelly 

              bathroom. The floor was filthy and sticky with G-d knows what. I 

              had to remove my shoes, trying to do one at a time, to take off

              done. I kept saying nothing was wrong, until the train ride home 

              when I burst into tears and told my husband what had happened, leaving

              Subject: <b>Re: Ryan's Story</b><br>

              <br>

              Hello All,<br>

              <br>

              I know this will be long, but I feel Ryan and I should tell his 

              story now that he has made the 1 year mark.<br>

              <br>

              My son, Ryan, was diagnosed Jan. 1st, 1996 with Crohn's. He was 

              in 8th grade at the time. His pediatrician had no idea of what his 

              problem was, and told us to take Ryan to a GI specialist.<br>

              <br>

              The GI had Ryan undergo a CAT scan and upper GI. By the results 

              of these two tests he was able to determine Ryan had Crohn's. We 

              had never heard of this disease. He suggested prednisone for starters. 

              By Feb. he was much worse. The GI suggested resectioning surgery. 

              A colonoscopy detected that surgery could kill him, because the 

              lining of his intestines was all but gone.<br>

              <br>

              The doctors had no answers, they suggested we take Ryan to the Mayo 

              Clinic in Rochester, MN. While there Ryan was given extensive drug 

              therapy. We took him home 3 weeks later, with 6 different prescriptions. 

              Ryan did well on the drugs. As summer came he was doing very well. 

              He was tapering off the drugs. As fall approached, Ryan began to 

              flare. He was again put back on all the drugs. By Feb. of 1997 Ryan 

              was back at the Mayo again. This time a resectioning was done; however, 

              3 weeks later Ryan was in pain, the symptoms were returning. The 

              doctors at the Mayo did another colonoscopy and discovered the colon 

              was now infected. By Oct. 1997, the doctors were advising more surgery. 

              It was at this point that a doctor in the ER told us of his brother. 

              He said his brother had Crohn's and after 5 years started a diet 

              that helped him more than drugs. He gave us the name of Elaine's 

              book and said, &quot;you didn't hear this from me.&quot;<br>

              <br>

              It took a lot of phone calls and searching but finally found a local 

              bookstore that could order the book for us. November 9, 1997 Ryan 

              began the diet, within 4 days he started to feel relief. By the 

              end of the first week, Ryan no longer had the bloody stools, the 

              cramps, or the D. By the second week, Ryan was getting more energenic. 

              He did experience the 2nd month flare, but it only lasted for 4 

              days. While on the diet, we started tapering Ryan's drugs. Ryan 

              has now been drug free for 7 months. He does take vitamins, magnesium, 

              potassium, and calcium. Most of these were suggested by members 

              of the list, over the last year. <br>

              <br>

              Ryan and I have learned so much by reading through everyone's postings. 

              Every time we had a question for the list, BINGO, someone else asked 

              before we could. So, we just sat back and waited to read the posts.<br>

              <br>

              During August, we called Elaine to tell her of Ryan's success. <br>

              She asked us to help spread the word. Well, we had already done 

              that. We've told several people in our area. We even spoke to the 

              Crohn's Support group in our area. I offer to help others get started 

              if they want to commit to the diet. Our next plan is to buy enough 

              copies of the book, to have them put in all branches of our public 

              library.<br>

              <br>

              Good health.<br>

              Subject: <b>SCD -- Is it enough? </b><br>

              </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello everybody, 

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am one of 

              the people who have had such success on the SCD that I am now so 

              busy enjoying a regular life, I have wandered away from participating 

              in the list as much as I used to. One of the pitfalls of getting 

              healthier! I have been on the diet since March 97, going on eleven 

              months now. I am someone whom the diet has helped very much. I know 

              there has been a lot of discussion on the list about whether the 

              diet is enough. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My opinion is 

              that for those whom it works for, it works very well. If it doesn't, 

              then it may not be worthwhile for you to be on the diet. Elaine 

              recommends a month on the diet to see if it helps. If it doesn't 

              perhaps you need something else, or a personal variation (which 

              could no longer truly be called the SCD, by the way). </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I myself had 

              to eliminate many so-called &quot;okay&quot; foods for a long time. 

              I even gave up honey, all dairy and all fruit except apples for 

              several months. Now I can eat everything. I even had some &quot;cheats&quot; 

              over the holidays, namely some chocolate and white sugar, and didn't 

              have a single symptom from my transgressions, which is really amazing 

              to me. I never dreamed I would have such good bowel health again 

              in my life. By the way, my condition has been IBD. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've been in 

              remission since last August. I have gone through many many patterns 

              of up and down during this past year, with relapses and bouts of 

              flu-like symptoms. But from my experience, I want to encourage everyone 

              to stay optomistic and keep trying. Don't give up and don't ever 

              cheat until you have at least been symptom free for a long time 

              (of course, Elaine recommends staying on the diet for a year after 

              you last symptom) and know you could handle it emotionally if you 

              backslide into a relapse.. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do what you 

              need to do for yourself if you need to take supplements, vitamins 

              or the drugs that help you, we are all highly individual. However, 

              it is my belief that the SCD really does rehabillitate bowel health 

              over the long term, even without additional measures. It may take 

              a long time. But the basic premise is sound. I know this from having 

              tried many angles of alternative health care and traditional western 

              medicine over many years of debilitation. I think I will remain 

              on an SCD pattern of eating for the rest of my life, because it 

              actually is rather habit forming after being on it so long. And 

              also because my Mom has had Crohns and I think my gut is my &quot;weak 

              link.&quot; I will undoubtedly always have to be careful. I can 

              still tell how stress affects my gut, although I haven't had a relapse 

              in many months. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I also think 

              it is important to really read the book -- and to re-read the book 

              at some point, because there are things you will understand after 

              being on the diet for awhile that might have not made as much sense 

              in the beginning. There is a lot of science to understand. I wish 

              everybody a great deal of luck to top it all off! </font>

              is everything that is on the SCD diet. I have not experimented with 

              grains at all, or anything else for that matter, short of the cheats 

              I had over the holidays that did not affect me adversely. But to 

              answer your question, four months. In August I was still not able 

              to eat some things. I might also add that I took medicine to erradicate 

              an amoeba at that time (in August) and that made a big difference 

              for me, helped along the SCD for me in a big way. I think it just

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks so much 

              for your update on your health. I am so happy for you. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I also have 

              good news. I have been on the SCD since June 15, 1997. I have experienced 

              some improvement and a lot of flares, particularly diarrhea. In 

              December, someone posted how they handle flares: back to the original 

              diet and after things settle, adding only 1 new food at a time, 

              allowing 2 days to see what that new food does to the guts. For 

              about 6 weeks now, I have been just on the &quot;starting&quot; 

              diet. At first, no difference; then, slowly, slowly I began to notice 

              a change in my bowel movement from watery diarrhea to less of that 

              and more of a formed stool. This past week, it has been only the 

              latter. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think I was 

              eating things on the diet that I simply was not ready for, i.e. 

              honey, (I still eat it in the cheesecake), fruit and yogurt! While 

              I haven't cut out the yogurt, I have reduced intake considerably; 

              only about 3 cups a week. No cheese, except the dry curd cottage 

              cheese which I put in the cheesecake and mix into the yogurt when 

              I eat yogurt. Rest of the time, I'm eating veggies (green beans, 

              all squashes, occasionally-- cooked skinless tomatoes,carrots and 

              zucchini) and chicken and fish and seafood. I try to alternate them, 

              eating a particular veggie/other food every four days. That's it. 

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I literally 

              can feel a shift happening in my guts. They feel &quot;stronger&quot;; 

              like I haven't experienced in about 10 years! I have Irritable Bowel 

              Syndrome or Ulceritive Colitis, depending upon which doctor you 

              trust! </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I plan to stay 

              on this diet for at least another 6 weeks, total of 3 months and 

              see what happens; if everything is okay, then slowly, slowly take 

              on a few of the other foods on the diet, one at a time and continuing 

              to follow the program above. </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hope this is 

              helpful to someone on the list. </font>

              5 months now. I still feel the same great! My stool hasn't changed, 

              my stomach doesn't hurt and no blood at all. The food that I am

              I have been on this wonderful diet since 12/24/96<br>

              I was at my worst, I was diagnosed with Crohn's 7 years ago. Never 

              had surgery and was told that I should have due to my blood count 

              and to my massive weight loss. I was on med's like prednisone, asacol, 

              etc. up until 3/97 I was told that I would need to stay on asacol 

              or 6mp for the rest of my life. I guess I had to prove them wrong. 

              Off all med's eating bread and potatoes, so far so good.<br>

              I have had Crohn's for over 8 years now and the last 2 years of 

              having Crohn's have been great! I thank GOD for Elaine and my doctor 

              for introducing me to the diet. When I started the diet I was at 

              my worst. I weighed 125lb and I am 5'11&quot;. My normal weight 

              prior to having Crohn's was 180lb. When I was diagnosed with Crohn's 

              I went down to 150lb and I could not gain a pound for the life of 

              me. Every day I had pain in my gut and every day I had to worry 

              when I was leaving my house where the next bathroom was located. 

              Once I started the diet I noticed a great improvement. I was gaining 

              approximately a pound a day for the first 34 days. My energy level 

              went through the roof. Well 2 years ago on this day I started the 

              diet and to this day that was the best Christmas present I can ever

              <br>

              Hi,<br>

              I've been on the SCD for 2 &1/2 years and I'm experiencing a bad 

              Crohn's flare. Several things brought it on. First I had my teeth 

              cleaned - that has always given me some trouble, maybe swallowing 

              the plaque that is scraped off sets off my immune system. Second 

              during the few days after the teeth cleaning, I ate some fresh cherries 

              - only about five or so, but even after 2 yrs. on SCD I still can't 

              eat fruit. Then a few days later while still not feeling so great 

              I ate dinner at a friends house. It was a BBQ, so there probably 

              was a little sugar in the BBQ sauce, plus I ate about 1 Tbs. of 

              baked beans -also probably had sugar in it. These are very small 

              amounts especially for someone on the diet for over 2 years. Well 

              I'm now in 40mg prednesone a day for the last 5 days. It has helped, 

              but now I want to taper off as fast as possible. I'm wondering what 

              some of you have experienced as far as tapering down and how quickly 

              you have done it. of course I'm being very strict with diet - only 

              cooked meat and vegetables - not fruit or dairy or honey.<br>

              Thanks,<br>

              <br>

              My daughter Chanelle is off to college this Saturday. It is a miracle 

              when you consider that last Oct. she was in the hospital receiving 

              three blood transfusions along with massive doses of antibiotics 

              and cortisone. It was touch and go for a week if she would need 

              emergency surgery for toxic mega<br>

              colon. She started the SCD diet in Dec. and has followed it with 

              fannatical adherance ever since.She has been good about it, never 

              once complaining "why me?" She did suffer two bad flare ups at the 

              three and six month marks. Both of these flare up occured when she 

              got down to low doses of rednisone(once at 7 mg and once at 0) Each 

              time she needed to go baack to 40mg. to put the fire out.We have 

              never had the courage to try to get through a flare up without drugs 

              because of how fast and hard it hit her the first time. Anyway she 

              has been on 8 mg. all summer and holding while we slowly switched 

              her from Asacol<br>

              to Sulfasaline (because of the lactose filler in Asacol). She looks 

              great (no gross side effects of prednisone) feels great, and is 

              so joyfilled about going to college.<br>

              cooking for weeks and freezing so I can send her<br>

              Wow, your story sounds so much like mine. I just subscribed to the 

              list yesterday, and posted some general background, but it sounds 

              like you're also new so you may not have read it.<br>

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quickie 

              version: I was diagnosed at 17 with Crohn's Disease. I've had one 

              resection (6.5 years ago). I'm now 27 and teaching high school math. 

              A few weeks ago it would have been more accurate to say I was trying 

              to teach high school math, as I had no energy and was in very frequent 

              pain/discomfort which I just couldn't stand anymore. I know where 

              every public restroom is in many areas of NH, and I know the walls 

              of my bathroom at home more intimately than any other room! I was, 

              even more, just trying to survive.<br>

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I knew the diet 

              would help, as I had started it most of the way (some cheating) 

              over the summer and it helped significantly. I couldn't/didn't maintain 

              it completely once school started, and I had gotten to the point 

              3 weeks ago where I was almost as sick as I had been last June.<br>

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I restarted 

              at square one, and after 3 weeks I feel GREAT!! This is the third 

              day in a row I've had no discomfort to speak of. The trips to the 

              bathroom have decreased from at least 6-10 a day to between 2-4, 

              frequently (though not yet always) formed. These things really excite 

              me these days. It feels SO good.<br>

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last summer 

              I had certain things I just couldn't resist, and I didn't improve 

              nearly as quickly as I have this time. Following the diet strictly 

              is definitely important. It helps even when you cheat, but it won't 

              have the chance to fully work it's magic.<br>

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AND, once you 

              start to feel better, it starts to be easier to maintain. Now when 

              I look at even my favorite forbidden foods, I connect them with 

              how sick I was not long ago. It was awful, and I NEVER want to be 

              back there. The more I associate certain foods with that pain, the 

              less appealing they seem. It helps a lot.<br>

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So yes, the 

              diet works.<br>

              </font> 

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last thing 

              is, I too had the idea that I would be sacrificing/investing a couple 

              of years of difficultly in order to be &quot;over it&quot; after 

              that and never have to worry about it again. One thing that has 

              helped in the last 3 weeks, as compared to my summer attempt, is 

              that I realize that the diet itself is no sacrifice at all compared 

              to the sacrifice of not being able to live any kind of enjoyable 

              life when I was so sick. It starts to seem like a gift. Yes, I would 

              like to eat garlic bread again in a few years, but if I don't it's 

              still okay. I wasn't convinced of that until recently, but now I 

              need no more convincing.<br>

              <br>

              We thought we should give our story since we know about lots of 

              you.<br>

              <br>

              Ten years ago, we were active professionals. First Shannon mysteriously 

              got sick followed a few months later by Dave. He was eventually 

              diagnosed as UC. Shannon was never diagnosed - the symptoms were 

              too mysterious (nauseous, weak, nervous, parasites). Believe me, 

              not knowing is worse than knowing. And for both of us to be sick 

              at the same time with similar symptoms was very strange. Dave had 

              diarhhea and Shannon didn't usually. Dave has seen 15 doctors in 

              4 states with no relief. Several batches of flagyl for parasites, 

              followed by another parasite drug, the symptoms persisted. They 

              put Dave on prednisone and sulfasalazine but it just made him worse. 

              Doctors didn't help Shannon so she stopped going and tried natural 

              approaches. <br>

              <br>

              This summer, we realized what it was: Lyme Disease we had gotten 

              12 years ago on a trip to New England. We read all of our symptoms 

              on lymenet.org. We both went to the doctor because we didn't feel 

              well shortly after the vacation and Shannon had the classic arthritis 

              for several months. We had Dave tested (he has medical coverage) 

              and it was positive. The only treatment for the late disseminated 

              disease (meaning you've had it forever and it's fully entrenched) 

              is months of I.V.<br>

              antibiotics. Shannon's always been allergic to them. We've been 

              searching for another answer.<br>

              <br>

              Dave's current doctor, a naturopath, put him on the blood type diet 

              and Shannon joined him. It was a terrible experience where we both 

              lost lots of weight we couldn't afford to lose but it led us to 

              the web site where someone recommended the scd book. We discovered 

              by elimination that grains were hurting us, one by one taking them 

              away until we were almost on the scd diet anyway. Being on two separate 

              diets was terrible<br>

              (Dave's an O and Shannon's an A) With Dave's UC, we knew he should 

              try the scd. Shannon went along because of the problem she was having 

              with grains. The diet also kills bacteria, etc., so we knew it should 

              work for Lyme Disease.<br>

              <br>

              Only three weeks later, we're both feeling somewhat better. We can 

              see the rainbow on the other side. Over the course of this illness, 

              we've lost everything. Neither of us can work. Dave is on disability. 

              His symptoms were specific enough that he could be approved. We've 

              gone bankrupt. Both of Shannon's parents died and she wasn't well 

              enough to go to see them or their funerals (Shannon's family sees 

              her as heartless<br>

              ). <br>

              <br>

              This diet is truly a Godsend. Sorry we got so longwinded.<br>

              <br>

              </font>Subject: <b>Ken is back--spread the SCD word!</b><br>

              <br>

              Last summer my husband, Ken (29 years old) was diagnosed with Crohn's 

              Disease. He was 6'5", 210 lbs, and went down to 165 pounds in a 

              VERY short time. Really, I thought we would lose him; we had no 

              idea what was wrong and it seems our doctors didn't either. He was 

              so sick that he had to go on disability for three months.<br>

              <br>

              During that time he learned about Breaking the Vicious Cycle. A 

              man at work had a relative's young son who was "cured" by this diet. 

              He was impressed with the fact that this woman was on television 

              with Dini Petty! (I presume he meant Elaine.) He gave me the phone 

              number and from there I went to the library and devoured the book. 

              It made sense. Ken read it and agreed. He went on the diet and began 

              to feel GREAT! He did not need to introduce new foods slowly, it 

              was almost an instant remission. He gained back all his weight.<br>

              <br>

              Anyway because he felt so good, he decided he could go back to his 

              old way of eating. I told the SCD list that I would lurk until Ken 

              decided to return to the diet. I had to see him get crampy (D) and 

              sick again, although not to the same extreme. We both knew that 

              if he kept up eating this way, he could very well end up with colon 

              cancer. So, a month ago, Ken went back on the diet. And once again, 

              he is feeling great, as though he is not plagued with the disease 

              at all!<br>

              <br>

              Being clergy in a stressful ministry, it is important that my husband 

              remain healthy and strong. We are the Senior Chaplain Couple at 

              a Rescue Mission, working with street men and women, and running 

              a substance abuse recovery program for men. These are the outcasts 

              of society and very hard to the core.<br>

              <br>

              Working at a Rescue Mission means dodging all types of traditional 

              goodies on a daily basis: donuts, brownies, cakes, pies, breads 

              of all kinds. Ken ate these every day! I'm surprised his relapse 

              wasn't faster. It was actually so slow and gradual we barely noticed 

              he was getting sick again.<br>

              <br>

              When I had told the SCD list what was happening, I recieved wonderful 

              support from Rachel, Dan, and Val. You said that it would have to 

              be his decision, but in the end he would have to come back to the 

              diet as his remission would fail going back to a standard American 

              diet. I am so appreciative of all of you on the list. I am grateful 

              that Ken made the decision to go back on the diet, completely free 

              from my nagging or hinting. Most of all I must give the thanks to 

              G-d.<br>

              <br>

              Michelle<br>

              <br>

              PS. I hope this wasn't too long for you all. There is actually a 

              moral to this story. Spread the word of this fantastic diet to everyone 

              you know. Don't be ashamed and don't be shy. Word of mouth is a 

              wonderful tool and if it were not for a man who knew very little 

              about it except that it had helped a distant relative... where would 

              my husband be today? Perhaps with the Lord. Who knows.<br>

              <br>

              PS. Rachel, is it possible to forward this letter to Elaine? I think 

              she would be encouraged by it. Does she have email? Let me know 

              please. <br>

              I had to share this with the group:<br>

              <br>

              I have been on the diet for 3 months, and most of my symptoms have

              I am so pleased, I had been on steroids for nearly 9 years in September,

              Dear Niall,<br>

              <br>

              This diet has been the answer to our prayers of the last three-and-a-half 

              years. My son was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at 11. We tried 

              alternative therapies ranging from acupuncture to hypnosis, as well 

              as prednisone, Asacol, sulfasalazine and cortisone enemas. Nothing 

              made much difference. Now, I can happily report that at fourteen, 

              he is doing much much better, after only three months on the Specific 

              Carbohydrate Diet. He has improved tremendously, and his response 

              was startlingly obvious within only two days of starting the elimination 

              of certain (most) carbohydrates. The book to get is Breaking the 

              Vicious Cycle, by Elaine Gottschall, and it will answer all your 

              specific questions. If you don't have it yet, be sure to order it 

              from Barnes and Noble. It is a dream come true for us.<br>

              <br>

              My heart goes out to you and your family. You need not watch your 

              son suffer like this, despite what the doctors say: there is help 

              available. And is not difficult to integrate into your lifestyle, 

              so you can now begin to relax into accepting that you have just 

              stumbled across a miracle. <br>

              <br>

              Hi Rachel,<br>

              <br>

              When my son was going to the bathroom twelve to fourteen times a 

              day, he never had to break from the roller hockey ring during a 

              game or practice. I always figured it was the sheer exhilaration 

              he was experiencing when he played. And it never failed to bring 

              me to a state of tearful joy to watch him in the rink, zooming around 

              at top speed. For a while, I hoped we could move beyond this illness 

              by focusing on the emotional realm. We tried to do it through hypnosis, 

              acupuncture, biofeedback, three and a half years of homeopathy....not 

              much happened. If we could've kept him surrounded by friends, on 

              roller blades...twenty four hours a day...perhaps, but that wasn't 

              all together feasible. <br>

              <br>

              We are so grateful for Elaine's dedication and SCD. It has turned 

              Daniel's life around. Right now, he is out for a bike ride on a 

              summer evening...away from the bathroom, just being a teenager. 

              <br>

              <br>

              Life is good.<br>

              With Love,<br>

              P<br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello Michelle, 

              </font>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have some 

              of the same questions that you do regarding the SCD diet. I came 

              out of eight years of Crohn's remission in september and went on 

              the SCD diet and Pentasa in october. My daily bouts of loose stools 

              and D. stopped almost immediately. I am staying strictly on the 

              diet, but am not limiting the quantities of any permitted foods, 

              ie. as much fruit, honey, yoghurt, nuts, meat, vegetables etc. as 

              I can eat. I seem to tolerate everything. The pains from inflammation 

              have subsided substantially, but are still present occasionally. 

              I was very anemic, but have been very aggressive with iron, b-12, 

              folic acid, and a host of vitamins. My blood levels improved quite 

              a bit in two months but still have a way to go. I have a stricture 

              that is too small to allow a scope through and finally, may be developing 

              my first fistula. I really hope that isn't the case. </font>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My feelings 

              on all this is that I will give nutrition (SCD) and modern medicine 

              100% each a chance to get me to the best overall health I can have. 

              Stopping eight years of D. is surely an improvement and I contribute 

              that exclusively to SCD. According to Elaine Gottschall that should 

              also improve blood levels. I expect it is the Pentasa that has helped 

              reduce the pain of inflammation this quickly. But it may not be 

              enough. We'll see. I've always been a firm believer in modern medicine. 

              But I chose to go on the SCD diet because it makes so much sense. 

              We are all learning as we go. I think the restrictions of the diet 

              is a small price to pay for the chance it may bring renewed health.
