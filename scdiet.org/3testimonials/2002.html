              every so often and just found out BTVC has 4 more reviews than it 
              had yesterday. Three related to IBD and got five star ratings but 
              one said I needed an editor. OK, I'll buy that. I didn't have all 
              the fancy shmancy Madison Ave. publishing company editors doing 
              a job for me; I did it myself so I guess it really should have professional 
              editing. But that aside, the following review made up for everything. 
              It is from Jennifer Young on SCD listserve with whom I have been 
              corresponding for a long time. Thank you Jennifer and Colin. With 
              help from above, we made it!<br>

              Healing Inside and Out</b>, January 16, 2002 <br>
              Reviewer: Jennifer Young from Fairfax, VA USA <br>
              How can I find words to describe the miracle that is this diet? 
              Following it has given me back my son in a way I never dreamed possible. 
              Elaine's diet has cure my son's autism and his three year struggle 
              with GI troubles. <br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My son Colin, 
              age 4 &frac12; , has struggled with GI troubles since 11 months 
              old. He had the ROTAvirus, chronic diarrhea, and was constantly 
              on steroids (for asthma) and antibiotics (for ear and lung infections). 
              By age two-and-a-half he was having night terrors every night. By 
              age three, he was labeled &quot;failure to thrive&quot; due to his 
              low weight and height. He was also diagnosed as having developmental 
              delays (Pervasive Development Disorder, ie Autism). He was behind 
              in speech and motor skills...he banged his head and stopped looking 
              at me. My son slipped away from me! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everyone had 
              answers for us...the mainstream doctors (neurologists) wanted to 
              give him drugs. The GI doctors thought Colin had &quot;autistic&quot; 
              diarrhea and wouldn't help us. They wouldn't even do a colonoscopy 
              on a child who had struggled with a GI disorder for years. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The alternative 
              doctors told us to cut out gluten and milk and use high dosages 
              of vitamins. Stopping gluten stopped his night terrors--but his 
              chronic diarrhea and delays continued. In fact, as I became a &quot;gluten 
              free&quot; cook and branched out to new starches, Colin's symptoms 
              got worse. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When my son 
              was labeled as having &quot;high functioning autism&quot; at age 
              3 1/2, God told me to &quot;put Colin first.&quot; So I quit my 
              job to save my son. I decided that instead of listening to &quot;experts&quot; 
              in autism, I would listen to my son. I knew he had the answers inside 
              him so I studied him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I always knew 
              Colin had a problem with food. His bizarre food cravings as a toddler 
              milk, cheese, and bread-had been replaced with a craving for gluten 
              free waffles, potatoes, and basically all starches and complex sugars. 
              Some said he was allergic to these foods. But, I knew it was impossible 
              for him to have 30+ allergies. I also knew if food was the problem-somehow 
              it was the answer too. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I concluded 
              that my son was not autistic, but instead a boy with celiac disease 
              or some other GI disorder. Then, thanks to a former co-worker, who 
              was a Celiac not cured by gluten-free living, I found Elaine's book. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within months 
              on Elaine's diet, my son's stools were normal for the first time 
              in his life! Then, he started doing complex pretend play, looking 
              at us, and advancing in AL AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT. He played with 
              toys appropriately. He voiced his wants, needs, and questions. Oh-the 
              glorious why questions! He started asking me questions about God, 
              about life, about the seasons...and about why his tummy had always 
              been sick. His teachers were amazed. Our family was amazed. We know 
              this diet saved him. We watched it happen before our eyes. No drugs. 
              No expensive behavioral therapies. Just diet. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I say don't 
              give up. When Colin couldn't digest the fruits and veggies, we cooked 
              them. When he couldn't eat the almond flour-we gave him squash and 
              banana for carbs until he was ready for the nut flours. We didn't 
              do the yoghurt described in the book at first-as Colin gets asthma 
              when he drinks milk. Then, we started using goat's milk yoghurt 
              instead so he could get the good bacteria he needed to heal. If 
              you truly want to get well, there is always a way. But you have 
              to have faith and be patient. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, my son 
              is the picture of health. He has gained 8 pounds and five inches 
              in less than a year! He has a healthy glow. He has normal bowel 
              movements. He has a wonderful appetite too. And now-he has caught 
              up in almost all areas. He has friends! Next year he will be going 
              to a regular preschool. Some doctors and others ask us now if we 
              have &quot;switched&quot; children. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All this through 
              food. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The other day 
              I told my son that I was going to help a friend of his start this 
              diet. I was explaining about the yoghurt, almond flour, etc. He 
              said, &quot;Mom, thank you,&quot; and threw his arms around me. 
              I said, &quot;For what?&quot; &quot;For me Mom. Thank you for me. 
              Thank you for making my tummy better.&quot; </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 
              Colin knows the power of this diet. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">God bless Elaine 
              for fighting for us all and for helping me save my son! </font></p>

              Jackie<br>
              Subject: Thank you!<br>
              Date: Sat, 19 Oct 2002</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My daughter, 
              Sarah Kilpatrick, was only a year old when we noticed her stiffening 
              up whenever she had to go to the bathroom. She would scream and 
              completely stiffen up. It was horrible to watch. As she began crawling, 
              her 'attacks' got worse. She would completely flatten out on the 
              floor, her hands would go back behind her, and her face would get 
              all red. Around 1 year of age, I gave her a bite of my oatmeal. 
              Her symptoms seemed to worsen. I noticed they were related to starch.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She was tested 
              at Yale. Her intestines were completely backed up and they put her 
              on a laxative. She was on this laxative for a month or two before 
              I found Elaine Gottschall's book. It made so much sense, that by 
              18 months, Sarah was on the diet 100 percent. She stayed on the 
              diet for three years, with very few lapses during that time. She 
              ate lots of eggs, egg and banana pancakes, chicken, chicken soup, 
              plantain chips as snacks, yogurt, cheese, fruits and veggies. I 
              also made her muffins and banana bread from nut flours (which, by 
              the way, I have tons of in my freezer, if anyone wants it).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sarah is now 
              6 years old and is a healthy, happy little girl. She has a weakness 
              for chocolate ice cream at times, but is doing fine. She still does 
              not eat mashed potatoes or stuffing, or very much cereal, but she 
              is growing beautifully.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We tell everyone 
              about this diet. I spoke with Elaine directly at the beginning of 
              the diet, and she said to give her a piece of Colby cheese. She 
              said she would love it. I would love to call her again. Maybe she 
              will see this update. Please tell her THANK YOU!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are thrilled 
              that the diet worked so beautifully and are convinced it could help 
              other children with dietary problems! Luckily, Sarah's pediatrician 
              said he had a family with 3 or 4 kids that had symptoms like Sarah's 
              and he referred me to the internet where I found Elaine's story. 
              <br>
              <br>
              It was hard at first, but then it became routine to only give Sarah 
              foods we knew she could digest. The change in her was huge - we 
              are still so thrilled! I actually documented everything she ate 
              and her problems and successes for months, if not years! If this 
              gives other people hope, that's great.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was diagnosed 
              with UC in August of 2000. The symtoms developed during my pregnancy 
              with my third child. I was<br>
              immediently put on prednisone and another drug. The symtoms would 
              temporarily subside, but any time I was tapered off- it<br>
              would worsen. This cycle continued for a year and a half until I 
              was put in the hospital because of dehydration, anemia,<br>
              extreme weight loss- I was told that my best option was surgery- 
              removal of the entire colon. As soon as I got home, I<br>
              decided it was time to educate myself. I am thankful to have found 
              the <a href="http://www.scdiet.org">scdiet.org</a> website. I immediently 
              bought the book and<br>
              began the diet. When I realized that I must be totally committed 
              to this way of eating- I experienced rapid progress. I have<br>
              now had a year of no symptoms and no medication! I still do not 
              understand the science of why it works although it's<br>
              explained in the beginning chapters- what is critical is that it 
              works! I enjoy a diet of great foods- fruit, vegetables, meat,<br>
              cheeses, nuts, and the best yogurt smoothies! My life has been restored!

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just wanted 
              you to know that, no, I'm not in the research community. I saw the 
              Digestive Health and Nutrition Magazine in my GI doctor's waiting 
              room a few months months back, thought I might learn something from 
              reading it, and pulled out a subscription card for it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have learned 
              more about my disease and how to treat it in the 4-1/2 months I 
              have been on this list than in the five years I've been sick, thanks 
              to you and all the other wonderful people out there. I just wish 
              I would have found BTVC and scd-list sooner, I don't think I would 
              have ever gotten as sick as I've been if I had. I am still just 
              baffled that the three gastroenterologists I have been to in the 
              last five years have all told me diet really makes no difference, 
              so for all this time I have believed them and feel like I have actually 
              been poisoning myself with the food I was eating. I'm still on prednisone 
              and not in remission, but feel like the diet is slowly turning me 
              around in the right direction. Thank you for giving me hope, because 
              the doctors sure haven't in the past five years.</font></p>

              Subject: Tinnitis (ringing of the ears)<br>
              Date: Thu, 24 Jan 2002</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I started experiencing 
              Tinnitis about two months after being on the maximum dosage of Asacol 
              to treat my Crohn's. I began to notice ringing in my ears when I 
              was in a quiet place. It sounded like a rather loud alternating 
              pitch; going from very high ringing to medium ringing off and on 
              constantly. I looked in the book &quot;Prescription For Natural 
              Healing&quot; by Phyllis A. Balch and James F. Balch under &quot;ringing 
              ears&quot; and discovered that Tinnitis is an indication of damage 
              to the ear's nerves. When nerves are injured from medication (in 
              my case) then the brain tries to compensate by sending electrical 
              signals to the ear, thus the ringing sound I heard. If the nerves 
              die then they can't replace themselves, which leads to Sensorineural 
              hearing loss. The book says, &quot;Sensorineural hearing loss can 
              be present from birth, or it can be caused by certain prescription 
              medications including certain antibiotics, nonsterodial anti-inflammatoy 
              drugs...&quot; etc. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tinnitis is 
              serious; it indicates nerve dammage due to too much medicine (in 
              my case) or other causes. So it's not really inflammation of the 
              ears, but actually indicates that you're hearing has been or will 
              be damaged. In my case, I found out that it could be caused by toxic 
              amounts of Asacol and was able to prevent hearing loss by calling 
              my doctor and asking him if I could lower my dosage of Asacol. He 
              was concerned and said that I should cut the dosage in half, and 
              if the Tinnitis continued for another week that I should first go 
              to my general doctor to check if the ringing was caused by a virus, 
              and if not that I should be taken off of the medicine completely. 
              Now, three weeks later, I hear hardly any more ringing which must 
              indicate that my nerves have been able to repair themselves.<br>

              Subject: Status update<br>
              Date: Sat, 16 Mar 2002</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi, it's Martha 
              in CT reporting in on the status of two of Elaine's &quot;graduates&quot;, 
              my husband and son. Husband Larry had Crohn's for 20 years; when 
              we first heard of the diet in the mid 1990's, he was discouraged 
              and just didn't want to eliminate his favorite foods on top of everything 
              else we had tried. When son Jon was diagnosed 12/99 with Crohn's, 
              I thought I was going to stop breathing. We all eased into the diet 
              right away, thanks to our naturopathic doctor recommending it and 
              the site and listserve. To make a long story short, we are all so 
              well. Jon's last symptoms were two years ago, when he ate regular 
              pizza and birthday cake at a party; he just celebrated his 11th 
              birthday and his 2nd anniversary of crohn's free living. He'd probably 
              say that the SCD has been tough, since he is a kid and doesn't like 
              to feel &quot;different&quot; from others; however, he knows an 
              awful lot more about nutrition than those other kids do and knows 
              what is right for him. Larry had surgery!<br>
              last spring to get rid of scar tissue and has been strictly SCD 
              ever since and feels great. Chocolate had been a Big Part of his 
              life in the past; sweets are often craved by Crohnsies! I am so 
              proud of his strength in Just Saying No to it. I think that seeing 
              how speedy Jon's recovery was on SCD helped to persuade him to give 
              it a chance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I guess I'll 
              be cooking this way indefinitely. My son knows that as one of Elaine's 
              &quot;graduates&quot;, he can add back some foods if he wishes to 
              do so; he says he really has no desire for them. He says that wheat 
              bread doesn't taste too good. Our naturopathic doctor believes that 
              we should always lean towards the SCD and I think she is right. 
              Reality is that all we've cut out is junk and starch. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I wanted to 
              write to thank Elaine, first and foremost, for disseminating her 
              valuable knowledge to all of us; and thank you webmasters and listserver 
              for your efforts; the sense of comraderie and support helped us 
              immensely. Two years ago, I never thought I could feed our family 
              of five SCD and I never thought I'd see an end to the pain. Here 
              we are.</font></p>

              Subject: Thank you!<br>
              Date: Thursday 10 Oct 2002</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About 2 years 
              ago, my husband (33 year old white male)began to have diarrhea with 
              bleeding and mucus in it, 4 or 5 times a day. He also had psoriasis, 
              an autoimmune skin problem. Anyway, he went to a gastro enterologist, 
              and he recommended a colonoscopy. During the colonoscopy, the doctor 
              woke my husband up to ask him how long he had had these symptoms 
              -- that's how serious it looked in there! The diagnosis was Ulcerative 
              Colitis, but the doctor later scheduled another colonoscopy after 
              watching the video of the first one again, as it seemed they missed 
              some polyps (or something - P.S. I didn't like this doctor. After 
              the second colonoscopy (2 months after the 1st), the doctor said 
              due to the extent of the ulcers and the degree of penetration of 
              the colon wall, he changed his diagnosis to Crohn's disease.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I had 
              been on the Atkins diet for a while at this point for weight loss, 
              and I knew a little about the benefits of a low-carb diet in general. 
              I searched the internet for hours every night and found out about 
              the scd. I ordered the book, and put my husband on the diet, which 
              was easy really since I was already eating low-carb.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For two years, 
              he didn't really have any flare-ups, which was really amazing. He 
              was good about the diet about 95% of the time, I'd say - on holidays 
              he'd go off it and regret it, getting gas and feeling tired. However, 
              about a month ago, he started having the bloody/mucus diarrhea again, 
              and I thought &quot;oh no - he has it back&quot; - I somehow felt 
              that things had to be really bad if he was on a specific carb diet 
              and STILL got the symptoms again. I felt that this time it wouldn't 
              just be asacol, but steroids, etc.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well - he had 
              another colonoscopy yesterday. New doctor - the other one was too 
              annoying. It's amazing. The lesions are GONE - completely - except 
              for the most distal 2 inches of the colon. I was looking at pic 
              after pic of totally healthy colon. Meanwhile, 2 years ago, he was 
              filled with lesions, polyps and ulcers throughout the colon and 
              deep into the colon wall. I couldn't believe it. The new doctor 
              was astounded - he couldn't understand it. He said he'd been preparing 
              his speech on other meds than asacol, figuring he'd be seeing a 
              bad bad case of crohns. So, all the bleeding was from this little 
              section of 2 inches, which was not really that inflamed after a 
              week of asacol. The doc said to stop the asacol - my husband no 
              longer has crohns but an incredibly mild case of UC.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My husband stayed 
              pretty strictly on the diet as outlined in the book for the past 
              2 years. He ate one cup of yoghurt per day w/strawberries. The only 
              supplements he took were: daily vitamin, 5 g glutamine/day, fish 
              oils (3 pills per day), and citracal calcium supplements. That's 
              it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you so 
              much - Elaine Gottschall and all the people who run this site, which 
              I used often in the beginning. It seems my husband has been cured, 
              really. We still have that last 2 inches of colon to work on, but 
              truly, what a miracle, and I thank God for this blessing.</font></p>
