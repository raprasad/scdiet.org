                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abstract: 
                    <br>
                    Regarding your post about the SCD &quot;hurting people&quot;, 
                    and the challenge the parent of your teenage student faces 
                    [in getting their child to try the SCD], I agree with [listmember] 
                    Brian in that I would have had a hard time with the SCD in 
                    high school (1982). In my opinion, getting the SCD to work 
                    requires an open attitude, personal motivation (vested interest), 
                    a supporting family or structure, and reduction of stress. 
                    This mix of critical success factors is not easy to accomplish. 
                    In reality, to get the drugs to *really* work in place of 
                    the SCD, the same is necessary. And while the doctors won't 
                    tell anyone about the SCD, they rarely discuss these other 
                    critical success factors, either. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Detail: 
                    <br>
                    I was diagnosed as a sophomore in high school. It was a very 
                    stressful time for me and I am quite certain that stress was 
                    the major trigger--there were others, including a slightly-remote 
                    family history of CD, having always internalized my emotions 
                    as a kid, and environmental factors -- there were 2 other 
                    kids not 1 mile from my home that were diagnosed with CD or 
                    UC the same year as I was. Perhaps it was something in the 
                    water? Was it the proverbial "Jewish mother syndrome" (mine 
                    is Catholic)? Was there some mysterious ingredient in the 
                    spray they used to kill the Gypsy Moth caterpillars that year, 
                    ala <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=B00003CXFV/goodbooksA/"><i>Erin 
                    Brockovitch</i></a>?? Was it all of this together? Yup. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, 
                    I did hear about a "change in diet" while I was in college, 
                    around 1984. At the time I was in a pain-free time, drug free 
                    state, and pretty much ate what I wanted and dealt with it 
                    - with plenty of diarrhea (D). Then in 1994 and 1995 I frequented 
                    the <a href="news:alt.support.crohns-colitis">alt.support.crohns-colitis</a> 
                    newsgroup, but I do not recall anything about diet. I do recall 
                    plenty of fish oil and omega 3 discussion, which I ignored 
                    because the Asacol and 6-MP were keeping me in a pain-free 
                    state (again, with plenty of D). <b>[Point: I was never able 
                    to get rid of the D until I started the SCD!!!]</b> In 1996 
                    my girlfriend Laura (now wife) introduced me to a woman named 
                    Louise Anderson (upper west side, NYC). I visited Louise 4 
                    or 5 times for "body and mind work". Whatever criticism anyone 
                    has about chakras and auras and craniosacral massage and the 
                    like--she can dispell all of that and make a believer of anyone--at 
                    least she made me a believer. Her key questions for me during 
                    all of our sessions were: "OK, so you got Crohn's back in 
                    1982. You've had it since then. Why won't you let it go? Why 
                    are you allowing it to control you? And most importantly, 
                    What would your life be like without it?" Ohhh, how I resisted 
                    answering those questions. I just couldn't. Or so I thought. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My folks 
                    had taken the whole family to someone back in 1983, several 
                    sessions' worth of psychobabble stuff. These sessions were 
                    just a big finger-pointing gripefest. I was not able to extricate 
                    myself enough to learn what was going on until I met Louise. 
                    Then in 1996 Laura and I came to Tucson on a vacation, to 
                    see if I would move here with her (versus my staying in NYC 
                    and her moving here for her Ph.D. studies without me). I fell 
                    in love with Tucson--the wonderful food, the hiking, the perpetual 
                    blue skies, the relaxed atmosphere, and more. Anyway, we were 
                    hiking one afternoon and I got a bad case of D. What had started 
                    as a wonderful day quickly turned sour. I lagged way behind. 
                    I squirmed and twisted to try to hold it back. It was horrible. 
                    Finally I explained that there was no way I could make it 
                    back to the trailhead and bathrooms. I needed to go. So, like 
                    so many others on this list, I found the most private place 
                    I could on the hard, rocky, cactus-ridden trail and made a 
                    big stinky mess. I had to use leaves to clean myself. It was 
                    so damned humiliating! And that was it--that was the last 
                    straw. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I got 
                    back to NYC, saw Louise one more time, and got the name of 
                    Elaine's book (Louise was well aware of it and had asked: 
                    Why I wouldn't try it?). Laura and I moved to Tucson, but 
                    it took me 2 months to purchase the book, four months to muster 
                    up the guts (pun intended) to try it. I found out that a new 
                    friend's son (10 years old) was on the SCD and was doing great. 
                    They told me how they cooked enough food for 2-3 days, put 
                    everything in glass or tupperware, and sent him to school, 
                    friends' homes for sleepovers, etc. When I started the SCD 
                    on 1/1/97, I told my wife that I was going to do it for 30 
                    days. Then another 30. Then another 30. And I've never looked 
                    back. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The success 
                    I enjoy with the SCD is so liberating. It used to be that 
                    when I dined out I'd eat and then have to go to the bathroom. 
                    Now that things are in control, and I know what to eat (and 
                    what not to) my life is - well, pure bliss!!! My wife and 
                    I both love to cook, so the added fun of translating our old, 
                    favorite recipes to SCD is just fine. We both benefit from 
                    the SCD (coincidentally, my wife has finally realized that 
                    she had suffered from IBS for almost 40 years. Eating the 
                    same food has done wonders for her, too). </font></p>

                    can see, maintaining the right "mix" keeps me in remission. 
                    It'll be four years this January 1st. I am so happy that I 
                    finally heeded all of Elaine's work and Louise's suggestions. 
                    It has made a world of difference. And that is why I dedicate 
                    so much time to maintaining the scdiet.org site, as well as 
                    my personal <a href="http://www.glassbird.com/scd">SCD food 
                    log</a> and other internet locations. So many will benefit 
                    from this regimen for remission! And has soooooo many have 
                    said, thank God for Elaine!!!! </font></p>

                    the fruits of SCD, all you'd have to do is substitute dates, 
                    names, locations (your most memorable nightmare was in the 
                    desert, mine was on a comuter train), and you'd have a story

                    keeps so many in the dark, it seems that an equal number, 
                    just take their gift and run, choosing to forget that this 
                    is a fight that needs every success story as amunition. I've 
                    had emails that say, in affect, "thanks so much for everything.

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To everyone, 
                    especially those folks who feel that they can't live without 
                    "regular" food: </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This morning 
                    I was thinking about how difficult it can be sometimes when 
                    all you want is one little croissant, one little bag of potato 
                    chips, something CHOCOLATE, for God's sake, and the analogy 
                    suddenly hit me, of repeatedly being drawn to the instant 
                    gratification of that hit, in spite of the devastating, chronic 
                    effects - just like alcoholism or addiction! I've never had 
                    an addictive bone in my body, but I think I'm getting a sense 
                    now of what it must be like to be alcoholic and confronted 
                    at every turn by social drinking, having to say, "No, thanks 
                    - can't touch the stuff," no matter how strong the desire. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's very 
                    simple - we sacrifice the short-term fix for the long-term 
                    benefit of health recovery. So to those who feel that they 
                    could "never" give up this or that or they couldn't possibly 
                    follow the diet without cheating, I would say this, along 
                    the lines of Rational Recovery, the system developed by Jack 
                    Trimpey for self-recovery from addiction: You are ruled by 
                    the neo-cortex (adult) portion of your brain, and you are 
                    allowing yourself instead to be pushed around by the primitive 
                    portion, that little child who wants his/her French fries 
                    *now*, the portion which keeps telling you that you cannot 
                    possibly adhere fanatically to so strict a diet - and you 
                    allow this to happen because it excuses you from pigging out 
                    on Cheetos. You are an adult. You have a responsibility to 
                    yourself to do whatever it takes to heal your body, and if 
                    you are not willing to face this fact, then you will reap 
                    the consequences. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I love 
                    potato chips, chocolate and Cheetos as much as the next guy. 
                    But those things which I love have been destroying me, and 
                    so, just like an addict, I have to leave them behind, even 
                    if it's painful. Period. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We all 
                    make our own choices in life. Just thought I'd share this.
