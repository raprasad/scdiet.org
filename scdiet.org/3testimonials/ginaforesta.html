                    IBD essay to share <br>
                    Date: Tue, 11 Apr 2000 <br>
                    From: GForesta@flairpromo.com</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                    <br>
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was 
                    contacted via e-mail by a fellow IBD sufferer who is trying 
                    to compile a book of essays for people with IBD by people 
                    with IBD on our experiences. I sent in an essay and wanted 
                    to share it with you all on this list. I don't know when or 
                    if the book will be published, but will keep you posted. It's 
                    a rather lengthy essay, but I hope it will inspire or help 
                    someone. Here goes: </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm thirty-one 
                    years old and have been living with UC for eight years. It 
                    has dramatically altered my life by being both a burden and 
                    a blessing for me and my family. When I first noticed symptoms 
                    I had never heard of inflammatory bowel disease. Unfortunately 
                    my first gastroenterologist was devoid of a "bedside manner" 
                    and offered little comfort or hope other than drugs. Naively, 
                    I accepted his bleak prediction of my future and the opinion 
                    of there being nothing else I could do. After the passing 
                    of six years, four hospitalizations, treatments of three different 
                    GIs who touted the "changing your diet will have no effect" 
                    theory, too many steroids, and too much trust in physicians 
                    and drug companies profiting from my illness?I had enough. 
                    The time had come for me to take charge of my own healing. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I began 
                    by exercising consistently. Though I had been doing yoga off 
                    and on for a few years, I became more serious about my practice 
                    to help to manage stress. I now do yoga daily and it has played 
                    a vital role in my recovery. I started food combining which 
                    involves separating proteins from carbohydrates, like meat 
                    with vegetables or grains with vegetables but no meat and 
                    grains at the same meal. In this practice fruit is eaten alone. 
                    It improved my digestion significantly and I continue to food 
                    combine today. Though all of this helped to put me in remission 
                    for a while I still experienced another flare. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This flare 
                    was unexpected and did not accompany an unusually stressful 
                    period in my life as my past flares had. I refused to even 
                    consider prednisone again and consulted a holistic doctor 
                    who in turn referred me to an acupuncturist. Together they 
                    discovered I had high levels of Candida which is quite common 
                    in IBD sufferers and oftentimes the culprit. I had been eating 
                    a lot of whole wheat and they suspected a food allergy or 
                    at least a sensitivity. Wheat in abundance can be very acidic 
                    and cause dysbiosis?an imbalance in the intestinal flora. 
                    The holistic doctor put me on an antifungal and then suggested 
                    I try The Specific Carbohydrate Diet, a diet developed by 
                    Dr. Sidney Valentine Haas and promoted in a book by biochemist 
                    and cell biologist, Elaine Gottschall, B.A., M.Sc., entitled 
                    Breaking The Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet. 
                    Dr. Haas helped Gottschall's daughter recover from ulcerative 
                    colitis through this diet. The diet excludes all grains, high-lactose 
                    dairy products, and sugar. It allows fruit, most vegetables, 
                    nuts, meats, eggs, certain dairy products like hard cheeses 
                    and homemade yogurt, and honey. At the time I had been eating 
                    a borderline vegetarian diet for years, with fish and poultry 
                    only occasionally, and I liked the discipline of my dietary 
                    choices. I mistakenly shunned The Specific Carbohydrate Diet 
                    at that time in my life and instead followed an alternative 
                    diet outlined by my holistic doctor. I excluded wheat, dairy 
                    and sugar and began an intensive program of Chinese herbs 
                    and supplements. I received acupuncture treatments regularly 
                    to balance the energy, chi, in my body. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The program 
                    developed by my holistic doctor and my acupuncturist helped 
                    to keep my UC under control with minimal symptoms and I was 
                    able to avoid prednisone. I continued on my maintenance medication, 
                    Pentasa, and was able to lead a normal life and never had 
                    to slow down or take any sick days from work. I know this 
                    was due also in part to my continued exercise and yoga routines. 
                    Despite all the improvement, however, I did have slight symptoms 
                    that were insistent on hanging on. I could never quite shake 
                    them and after a year of annoyance I took a hard and open-minded 
                    look at The Specific Carbohydrate Diet. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To paraphrase 
                    Mr. Frost, I decided to take the road less traveled and this 
                    has made all the difference. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Specific 
                    Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) has been the answer to all of my problems 
                    with my UC. I only wish I had found it sooner and that more 
                    people in the world knew about its healing abilities. The 
                    diet is based on sugars and how IBD sufferers digest them. 
                    There are three kinds of sugars, monosaccharides, disaccharides 
                    and polysaccharides. The digestive systems of IBD sufferers 
                    are impaired and can only digest monosaccharides. Monosaccharides 
                    are found in honey, fruit and certain vegetables. Disaccharides 
                    and polysaccharides are found in grains, all other sweeteners 
                    and dairy. When we ingest these our systems can not break 
                    them down and they pass undigested, ferment, and cause an 
                    overgrowth of bad bacteria. The book further outlines the 
                    science of this process and the guidelines of the diet. It 
                    has given me my life back. It is restrictive but very do-able 
                    and once one experiences the benefits of recovery, all the 
                    sacrifices are worth it. Many people can return to a normal 
                    diet after a few years on the SCD and some never experience 
                    flares again. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SCD 
                    is the best kept secret among IBD treatments, despite the 
                    fact that two million copies of Breaking The Vicious Cycle 
                    have been sold. Elaine Gottshcall has worked hard to bring 
                    it to the public but few westernized medical establishments 
                    have embraced it. The bottom line is?it isn't profitable for 
                    them. Fortunately, other research results have begun to surface 
                    concerning the role of carbohydrate digestion in IBD. Hopefully, 
                    this knowledge will begin to spread. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Living 
                    with this disease and living with this way of eating now has 
                    definitely altered my lifestyle. In the past I missed many 
                    days of work, and there are often quizzical looks at restaurants 
                    from servers and friends when I request special preparations 
                    of my food. All of this often ignites questions and I have 
                    had to learn to be open and honest about my condition. It's 
                    funny. If we had diabetes or food allergies, we wouldn't hesitate 
                    to acknowledge it. However, it is often difficult to admit 
                    that you have a problem with your colon. It immediately brings 
                    to mind a taboo subject. This is very unfortunate but realistic. 
                    I often say simply that I have a digestive disease. But recently, 
                    I have more often admitted that I have colitis and I haven't 
                    encountered any negative responses. People have been genuinely 
                    sympathetic and often are interested to learn more about my 
                    lifestyle. The more openly we speak of our disease, the less 
                    an embarrassing subject it will be. This is part of our lives 
                    and we have nothing of which to be ashamed. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I stated 
                    earlier that this disease has been both a burden and a blessing 
                    for me. The blessing has come with my appreciation for the 
                    life I live, the developed awareness of my body and health, 
                    and my family and friends who love me. I have also been blessed 
                    with being one of the growing number who have discovered the 
                    SCD and with having this opportunity to encourage other IBD 
                    sufferers to try it and recover. I will include several websites 
                    where you can find both the book and information about the 
                    diet, including the website connecting us to almost 400 users 
                    of the SCD worldwide who regularly post questions and answers 
                    and testimonials. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am now 
                    on the road to recovery and am well enough to begin to start 
                    a family with my husband. He has been my best friend, supporter 
                    and inspiration through many years of illness. I hope others 
                    have a support system like the one provided to me by my husband 
                    and family. I also hope this essay and my experience will 
                    encourage others to take charge of their own health and start 
                    the journey to recovery and to make the SCD road more traveled. 
                    I wish you all health and happiness. </font></p>
