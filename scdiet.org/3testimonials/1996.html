              1996 <br>

              Dear Deborah, <br>

              I was so happy to hear how well you are doing on the diet and that 

              you want to help spread the word. Thank you for calling and offering 

              support for this long crusade that my husband and I have carried 

              on. I kept copying letters until I got tired. There have been hundreds 

              of others who have written and hundreds who have called to report 

              the good news but have not written although I have asked them to 

              do so. In addition, it is most probable that only one in one hundred 

              will even contact me. We have sold 115,000 books and people keep 

              passing books around. In addition, doctors are using it (mainly 

              holistic, chiropractors, and naturopaths) and some have copied parts 

              of the book and distributed same to patients. So all in all, I imagine 

              there must be at least 50,000 people who are leading more normal 

              lives after the diet has helped. We have seen that it has not budged 

              the powers-to-be so all we can do is keep plugging on. So many medical 

              doctors have used the diet on their wives, children, and themselves. 

              Many have recovered but yet they do not tell their patients. I have 

              other articles written by people who have gotten so angry that they 

              have accused Crohn's and Colitis as waging some kind of conspiracy. 

              One woman is a novelist and while reviewing a book, injected a condemnation 

              of the Crohn's and Colitis Assoc. She is being punished by the paper 

              as she has had no reviews offered to her since. I have not included 

              articles such as these as they can make you very angry and that 

              will not accomplish anything. What you intend to do sounds much 

              more positive. Keep in touch and keep getting better. <br>

              Sincerely, <br>

              Elaine Gottschall </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sorry if I say 

              this too often but the diet has been wonderful for me. Yes, the 

              diet has helped tremendously. I leave out fructose, lactose and 

              gluten. I don't wake up in the night any more, bleeding has almost 

              stopped, and everything is MUCH better for this UC sufferer. I'm 

              determined to get well. Taking a healthy large dose of liquid calcium 

              seemed to help and I'm trying a dried Aloe Vera capsule. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keep trying, 

              diet is VERY IMPORTANT. M.M. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book is 

              about a specific carbohydrate diet. Basically, you can't eat grains, 

              potatoes, processed sugars and a list of other things. Beef, chicken, 

              pork, fish, nuts, and most veggies and fruits are OK. I very skeptical 

              about these diets, but after 4 months I can say that my CD symptoms 

              have improved. It is definitely worth a try. I found the book at 

              the bookstore in a local mall. <br>

              the Gottschall diet from her book BREAKING THE VICIOUS CYCLE, I'd 

              love to hear from you. I've have followed this diet for Crohn's 

              disease and IBS, and I have found that it makes a significant difference 

              in some of my symptoms. It doesn't work for everyone, but the diet 

              is a reasonable one and quite balanced. You need to give it a good 

              3 week try to see if it works. It really has helped with my cramping, 

              spasms and frequency of "D" . . . when I stick to it! C.S. </font></p>

              not only been on this diet and had great results, but I have also 

              been in contact with Elaine Gottschall. She is open to answering

              #1 Kirkton ONTARIO NOK 1KO FAX: 519-229-6969 She also wrote an article 

              for the newsletter I edited, "I.B.Details." To see a copy of it, 

              look to the web page where excerpts from back issues of "I.B.Details" 

              are made available. Here are some helpful hints I've learned along 

              the way. Instead of the dry curd cottage cheese, use FARMER'S CHEESE 

              readily available in stores. Also, make almond flour using a food 

              processor. The flour is used for breads, muffins, and cookies. Also, 

              if her version of making yogurt is too labor intensive for you (it 

              was for me!), use a regular yogurt maker. However, be sure to "cook" 

              it for 24 hours, not the time recommended on the package. Hope this 

              helps some of you. -C.S. </font></p>

            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have been on 

            the Gottschall diet for more than 7 months. All my symptoms have disappeared 

            except the gas. After only 3 - 4 months you will see this diet working. 

            While your husband's diarrhea is active you should stay away from 

            nuts, raw fruits and veggies and avoid a lot of honey. You have to 

            stick to the diet for 1.5 -2 years. Here is testimony from the net 

            that this diet works. GOOD LUCK. <br>

              she found the book after her colon was removed. Two of my husband's 

              cousins also have Colitis. I started T. on the diet in November 

              and the improvement has been very noticeable. She has been free 

              of diarrhea for one month and only experienced discomfort once, 

              which may not have been CD related. I hope this answers you questions 

              about her diagnosis. Thank you for your persistence in telling people

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our son P. was 

              diagnosed with Crohn's disease in April 1993, near the end of his 

              senior year in high school. He was put on sulfasalazine. However, 

              after two months he continued having diarrhea, pain, weight loss, 

              and weakness. We were then lucky enough to receive information from 

              a friend about the book "Food and the Gut Reaction" by Elaine Gottschall, 

              B.A., M.Sc. The book details a dietary program that has helped many 

              people in combating Crohn's. The dietary program is informed in 

              part by Mrs. Gottschall's two decades of research and teaching in 

              Cell Sciences, Anatomy, and Human Biology. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">P. started the 

              diet in June 1993. Within one week, he exhibited more energy. In 

              three weeks he had neither diarrhea nor pain. He has now been off 

              all medication for nine months and feels great. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We noticed in 

              reading "Profiles in Research" that there is no mention of research 

              on dietary or holistic approaches to managing Crohn's. Is CCFA doing 

              or supporting any such research? In particular, has CCFA investigated 

              the diet proposed by Mrs. Gottschall? Her updated book, "Breaking

              <br>

              Your book has been a tremendous help for my daughter. After starting 

              your diet 14 months ago, she has stayed symptom free. The diet has 

              also helped a number of other people with various digestive problems 

              whom I have seen in my practice. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I recently heard 

              of a French doctor who is conducting interesting clinical research. 

              For example he has found that certain old-fashioned grains which 

              have not been genetically manipulated (such as sarrasin and epautre) 

              do not cause Crohn's reactions. </font></p>

              to order three copies of your new book "Breaking the Vicious Cycle"

              pioneering work. <br>

              I forwarded your E-mail to my daughter so she can give you first 

              hand information. The diet has made a great difference in her life. 

              She follows it strictly but uses a great deal of creativity. Originally 

              her gastro-nterologist, aware of "alternative approaches," suggested 

              the diet. </font></p>

              psychologist who specializes in psychosomatic difficulties. I have 

              found Elaine's theoretical concepts about Crohn's and diet most 

              helpful. However, not all cases of Crohn's are the same. My daughter 

              went on the diet the second year after her symptoms had started. 

              At this point she had not been given the full range of classical 

              medical treatments and this I believe made a positive difference.

              if he followed the diet as strictly as his sister and it seemed 

              that the high cheese protein was not good for him. He now follows 

              a modified type of the diet which allows some of cereals. </font></p>

              cold drinks assist intestinal breakdown and the "running wild" of 

              the immunity system. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><< Crohn's disease 

              is a wicked, gnawing horror to anyone living with it. It is an illness 

              that attacks the basic beliefs and knowledge of modern allopathic 

              medicine which treat it as a digestive problem rather than the sign 

              of an immunity problem. My theory is that the kidney, spleen and 

              liver become overloaded and can no longer do their job. As a result, 

              the gut becomes a highly selective excretion organ instead of an 

              absorption organ. This is a reaction, or wisdom, of the body that 

              keeps us alive and functioning. Unfortunately medicine in the U.S. 

              and in Europe (Belgium has the highest per capita rate of Crohn's 

              in the world) cannot view CD as an immune problem because this becomes 

              an attack of the basic belief that organ systems, to a great degree, 

              function independently). In Europe the traditional treatment is 

              not any better. However, homeopaths, acupuncturists, and naturopaths 

              are better trained and can keep people from surgery. My daughter, 

              who lives in Reston, VA, improved incredibly by using the a diet 

              (the Haas Specific Carbohydrate Diet). The diet was suggested by 

              a NY nutritionist. Basically, the diet eliminates anything that 

              can produces toxins which trigger the immunity system.>> </font></p>

            <br>

            I was sick with diagnosed ulcerative colitis over seven years ago. 

            For over five years, I suffered from severe pains, cramps, chronic 

            diarrhea and severe bleeding. Over four years of treatment by medical 

            doctor and a period of hospitalization provided no relief for my problem. 

            My son saw your interview on the Dini Petty Show, so I ordered your 

            book and started your (specific carbohydrate) diet on March 1, 1991. 

            Within six months I felt much better. There was no bleeding, less 

            gas and relief of severe stomach and bowel pain. Now, a year and a 

            half later, I am continuing the diet and feeling much better. I recommended 

            your book to others I know with this problem. I wish I could let more 

            people know how helpful this book has been in getting me back to health 

            and a full life. I would be interested in forming or joining a support 

            group in my area for people working to regain health through your 

            diet. Thank you for giving back my life. <br>

            Dear Elaine, <br>

            Thank you for the discussion we had this evening. I am a 67 year old 

            male and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in the spring of 1994. 

            I was fortunate enough to see the Getting Healthy TV program in the 

            fall of 1994 and purchased your book as soon as I could locate a copy. 

            I started the diet on October 18, 1994 and now I am completely free 

            of any symptoms. Initially, I thought it would be difficult to stay 

            on the diet when I went out to eat, but I have always been able to 

            find things on the menu or have the restaurant accommodate me. (For 

            example, substituting potatoes or rice for more vegetables.) I purchased 

            additional copies of "Breaking The Vicious Cycle." I sent one to a 

            friend in the Netherlands and gave another copy to my gastroenterologist. 

            The gastroenterologist kept making excuses for not reading the book 

            until I said I wouldn't keep my next appointment until he read the 

            book. After looking at the book, he said "the diet can't do any harm." 

            After the original diagnosis the doctor prescribed ASACOL. I am now 

            down to 3 400mg tablets a day, which, as you stated, the doctor probably 

            believes is responsible for the remission. Once again, thanks for 

            the helpful comments. <br>

            "Food and the Gut Reaction". I had suffered from Crohn's for seven 

            years and have now followed this diet for two months. It has made 

            an incredible difference in my symptoms. She [Elaine Gottschall] is 

            not the only person who claims people with Crohn's develop food intolerance. 

            Much research has been done in Cambridge, England. In particular, 

            for the past 15 years, Dr. John Hunter has used diet as a means of 

            controlling Crohn's disease with an extremely high success rate for 

            people with Crohn's in the small intestine. (It is more difficult 

            to control the disease if it is located in the colon or large intestine.) 

            DO NOT listen to the medical opinion that Crohn's disease and food 

            are not related. Diet does not work for everyone, but it sure as hell 

            is easier to try adjusting your eating habits then letting the disease 

            continue. Controlling the symptoms with medication never allows the 

            intestines to heal. </font>

              flexible scope, etc.; gave me various medications; and told me, 

              "be sure to take bran!" I have walked with almost unbearable pain.

            Dear Ms. Gottschall: <br>

            I wrote to you earlier this year and received a warm letter in return. 

            To freshen your memory, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 1982 

            and since then have had six surgeries. I have only four feet of each 

            intestine remaining. Earlier this year I was placed on a temporary 

            feeding tube and faced the possibility of a permanent one. Instead, 

            I decided to try your diet. I started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet 

            on September 1, 1994. I have never felt better in my life. At last 

            my weight is up and stable. I have no pain and I can exercise again. 

            I feel like a new person. My twin sister is also on the diet. I have 

            told everyone who will listen about your diet and your book. I recently 

            ordered the new edition of your book as well. I am enclosing a letter 

            I wrote to a columnist regarding a letter she received from a reader. 

            I want to tell the WHOLE WORLD about the diet. If I can experience 

            these results then ANYONE can. The only individuals who do not support 

            my diet are the gastroenterologists who would rather treat me with 

            steroids and chemotherapy. Don't get me wrong, when I need a doctor, 

            I'll go. But for now, I am sticking religiously to my diet. I can't

              Hi, Just one minor point. I believe the book says if the diet is 

              going to be effective, the person will show significant improvement 

              in the first month. I'm acquainted with about a dozen people who 

              have been using the diet for various lengths of time, all with positive 

              results. Many of the group are symptom free. However, the length 

              of time takes to get rid of the symptoms is highly individual. It 

              depends a lot 1) on how well you follow the diet (and it can be 

              *tough*), 2) how bad/extensive the disease is when you start it--for 

              those who are nearly obstructed, she [Elaine] says it may be too 

              late to avoid surgery. With all the people I personally know, the 

              diarrhea, inflammation and cramps have stopped somewhere between 

              three weeks and four months. Also, after being on the diet for 4-6

              <br>

              Dear Elaine, <br>

              This letter is from C. S. of Saskatchewan. I phoned into the CBC 

              Radio Show on October 13, 1995 when you were a guest in Regina. 

              You asked if I would write to you. I often felt like I should write 

              and thank you for your book Food and the Gut Reaction. It was a 

              great help in overcoming ulcerative colitis but sometimes I feel 

              shy about writing letters. By the way, I was pleased to win your 

              book in the draw that day. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I recommended 

              your book, Food and the Gut Reaction, to many other people who heard 

              about my success and phoned me to ask what I did to solve my problem. 

              I have heard back from some people saying that they are much improved. 

              I am absolutely convinced that if anyone doesn't have a lot of improvement 

              it's because he or she hasn't followed your suggestions closely 

              enough. It is very difficult for some people to change their eating 

              habits and stick to a rigid diet. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I suppose that 

              I should give you a little history of my own experience. In the 

              late 80's I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The doctor said 

              that they rate the seriousness of ulcerative colitis on a scale 

              of 1-5 and I was a 4. The pills he gave me did not help. I'm not 

              sure of the spelling but I believe they were Asacal and Sulfasalizine. 

              I was told by the doctor (specialist) that I could eat anything 

              but I doubted his advice. I read everything I could get my hands 

              on about my condition. One day when I went to see the specialist, 

              I brought a whole page of questions about diet and nutrition. When 

              I started asking these questions, he became very defensive and said 

              that people who wrote these books were illiterate. That day I left 

              his office, flushed his pills down the toilet, and went on my own 

              diet. I had some success but then I read your book Food and the 

              Gut Reaction. In one week on the SCD I was improving. The second 

              week I was much better and by the third week I knew ! There was 

              no turning back. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My only problem 

              was that I was eating a lot of raw fruit. In the fall of 1989 I 

              had a setback. I was really confused. The blood showed up again, 

              so my family doctor sent me to a different specialist. I was desperate 

              so I agreed to let him put me on steroids. (By the way, my own family 

              doctor has been quite supportive of my experimenting with the diet-- 

              he admitted he couldn't help much with diet for colitis but said 

              if what I was doing was working to keep doing it). Finally, a good 

              friend of mine was in a health food store in Calgary and picked 

              up an article that was written by a Doctor Delmar Gibbons who had 

              colitis himself. He also wrote a book called The Self Help Way to 

              Treat Colitis and Other IBS Conditions.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 

              said that too much fructose was not good for people with colitis. 

              As a result, I cut all fruit out of my diet and in one week I was 

              getting better again. I was still on your diet and I went to the 

              specialist and asked if he would take me off the steroids! </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He disagreed 

              but helped me ease off them anyway. The last day I left his office, 

              he said to me, "You will be back in six months." That was 5 years 

              ago. By religiously sticking to your diet and not eating too much 

              raw fruit, I managed to gain 30 lbs in two years. Getting back the 

              weight I had lost made me feel like a new man. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I feel I am 

              a good example of someone who has often had poor advice from doctors 

              and decided to go out and take responsibility for my own health. 

              It has taken a few years to educate myself to the point where I 

              feel as though I have some control over my health. Maybe I had a 

              few things going for me to start with. I have never been a drinker 

              or smoker. I don't consider myself religious, but I think that I'm 

              a very spiritual person who was lucky to have had parents who set 

              a pretty good example for me to follow. With the experience that 

              I've gone through, I feel that there is a real need for a place 

              like a Health Center where people can go to get proper information 

              about diet and nutrition and some guidance to help them live a healthier 

              life style. When I am at the grocery store, I cannot help notice 

              what people have in their shopping carts. No wonder we have an epidemic 

              of people with gastro-intestinal problems. I notice the number of 

              obese people. Men (with their big stomachs),! women (with their 

              big behinds) and kids overweight and out of shape. People are getting 

              sick and going to doctors. They are not always getting good information 

              and ending up in hospitals. It is breaking our Medicare system and 

              no one seems to be getting at the root of the problem. By the teaching 

              of prevention of illness through proper diet and lifestyle, many 

              such cases would be avoided. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here comes my 

              big plan: I am hoping to walk the length of Saskatchewan, from north 

              to south (approx. 800 miles). I would walk with 3 other 30 year 

              olds as a team. No one has ever done this before. There are no roads 

              for the first 90 miles so we would have to start in March when the 

              lakes and rivers are still frozen. We would have to be accompanied 

              by a snowmobile train for a few days. I think the entire trek would 

              take approximately 40 days. Hopefully we will get enough sponsors 

              to raise enough funds to start some kind of a health center. So. 

              MAYBE. SOMEDAY. MAYBE. The projected trek would take place in spring 

              of '97 or '98. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changing the 

              subject a little: I am sending you a gift copy of my own book on 

              Stackwall Construction, as well as a pamphlet on our Bed and Breakfast 

              in Costa Rica. My wife J. and I are half owners of the property. 

              Our partners have a business in Vanscoy, so Jackie and I spend four 

              months in Costa Rica operating the Bed & Breakfast (usually from 

              Dec. 1-April 1). While in Saskatchewan, we live on a small farm 

              (160 acres). My brother farms our land. We also have four acres 

              of Saskatoon berries (organically grown) where J. and I spend a 

              lot of time. Love, C</font></p>

              Dear Elaine, <br>

              Thank you for your letter of April 27 in response to mine of April 

              17, 1995. This past Saturday I purchased your new book "Breaking 

              the Vicious Cycle" from Barnes and Noble in Massapequa, Long Island, 

              New York, The clerks in the store told me was in great demand. I 

              gave the book to my daughter who has had intestinal trouble for 

              ten years. Prior to giving her this new book, I gave her a copy 

              of your Food and the Gut Reaction. She followed your advice for 

              just one week and she felt a hundred percent better. Her problem 

              had ceased. She plans to follow your advice for a long time to come 

              to make sure she stays well. Thank you for this wonderful miracle. 

              J.M.K. </font></p>

              Deborah A. Dowd</font><br>

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Originally, I 

              was diagnosed in September 1986 when emergency surgery revealed 

              what two years of tests (and incredible pain, mental stress and 

              weight loss) did not: a mass of Crohn's tissue. The doctors removed 

              the diseased sections and gave me a temporary illeostomy. In December 

              1986, my intestine was reconnected and I experienced no symptoms 

              for almost a year. During that time, I participated in several community 

              activities, worked full time as a postal carrier (walking an eleven 

              mile route carrying a thirty pound mail sack), and enjoyed life 

              without illness or even thinking about illness. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In July 1987, 

              symptoms began again. By October, I was forced to quit my physical 

              job and in December began a desk job. By February, my symptoms were 

              bad enough to put me in the hospital. There I spent a week being 

              fed an elemental diet via NG tube. This time they knew what was 

              wrong and didn't waste telling me I was anorexic or just a "nervous 

              type." I felt better almost immediately from the elemental diet 

              treatment. A few weeks later I became pregnant which put me in what 

              I considered remission--no pain, only diarrhea. I became pregnant 

              a second time before symptoms returned. After my second pregnancy, 

              when my son was nearly one year old, I began to have problems again. 

              I coped with it experimenting with different foods. I found some 

              success by following a low fat diet and avoiding popcorn, nuts and 

              beans. Although I wasn't symptom free, I could live with it. I became 

              pregnant a third time and symptoms slowed again. After my youngest 

              child was a year old, my health! spiraled downward faster and harder 

              than ever before. Once a week, I had severe flare which lasted twenty 

              four hours and from which it took me another twenty four hours to 

              "recover." Also, I began finding blood in my stool, something new 

              and scary to deal with! I couldn't seem to find anything safe to 

              eat--EVERYTHING seemed to cause problems. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For six months, 

              I waited for a specialist to assess how bad my Crohn's had become. 

              I had never been on any medication for Crohn's. I hadn't even SEEN 

              a gastroenterologist since my elemental diet treatment in Feb 1988! 

              While I waiting for my appointment and continuing to get worse, 

              I got online. In September 1995, I read someone's e-mail saying 

              she was CURED of Crohn's by going on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. 

              My interest was aroused!! She recommended reading "Breaking the 

              Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet" by Elaine Gottschall 

              which I immediately ordered. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When I received 

              the book and read the diet, I thought, "No way. Many of the things 

              she says are safe to eat have caused me problems in the past." However, 

              with the encouragement of another person on the diet, and still 

              waiting to be seen by a specialist, I committed myself to follow 

              the diet strictly for one month, the recommended length of time 

              to see if the diet will help. Within a week, I noticed definite 

              positive changes. My abdomen felt weird after eating. Then I realized 

              that I was waiting for the usual digestion pains to come and THEY 

              DIDN'T! By the end of the month, I was symptom-free. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the first 

              month I cheated a couple times and experience four days price of 

              pain, bloating, and diarrhea. I have now been on the diet for over 

              three months and I am in it for the "long haul." Even though I know 

              that I could cheat and then use the diet to feel better, it isn't 

              worth it. I'm shooting for the long term goal of being able to eat 

              as I choose. In her book, Mrs. Gottschall says that after two years 

              on the diet, a Crohn's Patient can challenge the "illegal" foods 

              one at a time. If they give no problems, they may be eaten in moderation 

              once again. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides a lessening 

              of the Crohn's symptoms, I've experienced other benefits while on 

              this diet. Since no lactose is allowed, my sinuses have completely 

              cleared. Before that I always thought my nose kept dripping due 

              to allergies! In addition, the strength and stamina I have now are 

              comparable to the year immediately following my surgery in 1986. 

              I no longer have to rest after grocery shopping so that I can bring 

              the bags from the car to the house. I can DO so many things now 

              that before were UNTHINKABLE. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm HEALTHY! 

              It is truly an incredible feeling!! I'm still waiting to see the 

              specialist (my appointment is next month!) but within the last few 

              weeks my family doctor has prescribed azulfidine to help keep me 

              in remission. While I don't think it's necessary, I'm taking the 

              tablets as a compromise. He talked to a gastroenterologist about 

              my symptoms from four months ago and together they felt I should 

              go on steroids--without even examining me! In my opinion, the "maintenance 

              dose" of Azulfidine is much safer. As many people have already learned, 

              most doctors don't believe that diet and Crohn's have much to do 

              with each other! </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BTW, I don't 

              get any money from this book or diet. In fact, I'm spending A LOT 

              of money online telling everyone about it!! (Too much!!) I just 

              can't believe that more people don't know about this diet! I wrote 

              to the CCFA (Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America) asking them 

              if they have reviewed the diet at all. Their reply was that while 

              they are aware of the diet, they have not studied it. Oh well. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book probably 

              can be found at the library. That way, you could try it for a month 

              without spending any money, if you want. (If not, any library or 

              bookstore can order it with the ISBN#) The basic premise of the 

              diet is to avoid all lactose, all refined sugar and all grains. 

              It is tough, but the book gives helpful alternative recipes. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am interested 

              in hearing from other people who have tried the diet, both good 

              and bad results. I have been compiling testimonials on the diet 

              to share with others. If anyone has any questions about the diet, 

              or my experience, or would like to share their experience feel free 

              to write me at 100760.1110@compuserve.com (Deborah A. Dowd). </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks for "listening." 

              I hope your search for health is a rewarding one! </font></p>

              Hi, I'm responding to your note on the Gottschall diet. I've been 

              using it for about 4 months with reasonable success. When I started 

              the diet I had instant success for about 2 weeks. Then I started 

              to get diarrhea 2 or 3 times a week and couldn't figure out the 

              cause. But I stuck fastidiously to the diet and have slowly improved. 

              Twice now I've managed to go nearly two weeks without problems. 

              However, I still get diarrhea for no apparent reason. I read that 

              as the undesirable bacteria in the gut die they release toxins. 

              Perhaps this could explain the diarrhea. </font></p>

              Hello Ish, <br>

              I am on the diet. I had Crohn's diagnosed about 10 years ago and 

              have had 3 surgeries since, the most recent 3 years ago. I experienced 

              varying amounts of pain (sometimes severe) and had diarrhea almost 

              all the time. I've been on prednisone, sulfa, 6-MP, Flagyl, and 

              a host of other meds at one time or another. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've been on 

              the diet almost 3 months now. I'm hoping it will cure me of this 

              dreaded dis-ease. At 3 weeks, the diarrhea stopped and has not returned. 

              At about 8 weeks the pain started to noticeably lessen. Three months 

              ago I was in constant pain. Today, pain is the exception. While 

              the it is not gone, it is significantly reduced in intensity and 

              frequency. And, I continue to improve. </font></p>

              wonderful woman. I've talked to her on the phone several times. 

              She is home in the evening and is happy to discuss any specific 

              questions. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Officially, 

              I would check with your doctor before changing anything in your 

              lifestyle. However, in my experience, MDs are not interested in 

              cures for Crohn's. My GI doctor simply stated "There is no scientific 

              evidence that this diet will help." Of course, he didn't know any 

              details about the diet and showed no interest in looking at the 

              book I had brought. However, he is right. There is no "scientific" 

              evidence this will work. But then, I don't particularly care about 

              scientific evidence--my interest is selfish. I simply want something 

              that will cure me of Crohn's and I believe this will do it! </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By all means, 

              stay on the meds your doctor has prescribed. As the diet begins 

              to cure you, work with your doctor to reduce and eliminate the meds. 

              I've discussed this diet with several nutritionists and they also 

              don't seem interested. But there is at least one doctor in New York 

              that will support you in this effort. There might be others. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am currently 

              involved in an IBD support group that is corresponding via CIS E-MAIL. 

              There are about a dozen people in the group and 4 or 5 are currently 

              on the diet. You are welcome to join us--just let me know. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do yourself 

              a favor and try the diet for 30 days. After that, you can re-evaluate 

              your options and make a decision. Personally, I will remember this 

              year and this diet as the time when I found the cure. Maybe the 

              doctors don't believe it and of course there are other skeptics, 

              but that's their problem not mine. For most people, it becomes a 

              journey where you will return to health. </font></p>

              >> My only concern right now is will I lose any weight after starting 

              on this diet?>> <br>

              Hello Ish, Actually, I did. However, I needed to. I am 5'8" and 

              started out at nearly 195 lbs. When I started the diet, I lost several 

              pounds a week. Worried, I called and asked Elaine about it. From 

              her experience she finds that people with chronic diarrhea are often 

              overweight. She has also observed that with her diet, overweight 

              people tend to lose and underweight people tend to gain. For the 

              last month my weight has stabilized at 175 pounds which is closer 

              to what I should weigh. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 

              my pulse and blood pressure both dropped by nearly 25%. I'm not 

              sure if this was a result of the diet, the weight loss, or both. 

              My resting pulse is about 65 and my blood pressure is 95/60. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I talk to Elaine 

              regularly, the last time being earlier this week. She doesn't have 

              any modifications to her diet or suggestions, but she has written 

              an updated version of her book. It contains a couple of extra chapters 

              and additional recipes. It is titled "Breaking the Vicious Cycle" 

              and is ISBN # 0-9692768-1-8. Although I don't have the book, I understand 

              it can be purchased through Walden Books, B. Dalton Books, Borders

              Hello Ish, I assume you have the book. The phone number listed in 

              the back as the address of the publisher is actually Elaine's home 

              number. I'd suggest calling her to discuss the specifics. She is 

              home in the evening and I'm sure she would love to talk to you. 

              I've called her several times. Be aware, she talks very fast. Get 

              ready to write quickly or even record the conversation. She will 

              give you a wealth of info in a very short time. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I understand 

              it, a relapse is normal. After close to three months on the diet, 

              I had a significant relapse which lasted about 2 weeks. Are you 

              following the diet very strictly? I understand that even a little 

              bit of cheating can potentially cause trouble. Strictly speaking, 

              NOTHING processed may be eaten. ONLY those things specifically mentioned 

              in the book should be consumed. It can be tough. Nothing out of 

              a can or jar. Nothing made in a factory. It is also important to 

              eat a variety of foods and pay close attention to the spiritual 

              and emotional aspects of your life. I know this may sound silly, 

              but after 10 years of searching, this is the one that is going to 

              cure me of this dis-ease. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am doing very 

              well with no Crohn's symptoms and I hope to continue. Also, I recommend 

              that you discuss the situation and the diet with your personal physician. 

              Unfortunately, he will probably dismiss the diet without a second 

              thought. I spent many years in self-diagnosis and I know how tough 

              it is. On the other hand, I think I did a much better job with my 

              body than my MD was capable of.</font></p>

              is a specific BLAND diet listed in her book, but it's totally different 

              from what is normally considered bland. When I have a flair, I resort

              Dear Mrs. Gottschall,</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

              You may not remember me but I started your diet six months ago (May 

              1, 1995) and spoke to you several times. At that time, you graciously 

              faxed me an interesting article regarding my spondylitis. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these past 

              six months, I've had three minor bleeds of short duration in these 

              past 6 months which in itself has been a minor miracle. I've been 

              feeling great and last Friday I had my yearly colonoscopy. I expected 

              good news but was startled by my gastroenterologist's report: Aside 

              from scar tissue (I don't think "scar" was the term he used, but 

              that was the implication), my colon currently looks like that of 

              a healthy 18 year old. In fact I'm 49 years old and after a long 

              history of GI problems I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at 

              the age of 41. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had no intention 

              of even trying the diet when I first read it--it was the opposite 

              of the diet suggested by my Doctor. I truly believed it would put 

              me in the hospital. However, by a stroke of divine intervention 

              ( I am not a religious person), as I fearfully put your book down, 

              I received a phone call from a cousin who knew someone with Crohn's. 

              This person had recently gone on a "gluten" free diet. I immediately 

              called this stranger and listened to a tale of miraculous remission.

              <br>

              I had an extremely GOOD experience with homeopathic medicine, particularly 

              with a certain diet I discovered in a book called "Food and the 

              Gut Reaction." I had been extremely ill with Crohn's for five years 

              and was at the end of my rope. The pain was constant and my hair 

              began falling out from malnourishment. While visiting my grandmother 

              in Canada, my mom came across the Food and the Gut Reaction book. 

              Within one month on the diet my pain was gone. In another three 

              months, all my symptoms disappeared. I followed the diet for a year 

              and a half. I now eat what I want and have been Crohn's "free" for 

              about two years. If this diet helped me, it can help anybody. I've 

              referred several other people to the book and they've all had great 

              results. Although the diet is very strict and tough to stick with, 

              it is definitely worth it. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It forbids grains, 

              most dairy products, and sugar. The author clearly explains the 

              details of the diet as well as the scientific basis behind it. My 

              doctor basically told me it was bullshit, but he can't explain why 

              it was so effective for me and for others. It sure can't hurt to 

              try it. It's a lot less damaging to your body then all those steroids.

              Here is the testimony on my son's battle with Crohn's. This testimony 

              was part of a letter I wrote to Elaine Gottschall, the author of 

              the book entitled "Food and Your Gut Reaction." The book is now 

              reprinted under a new title, "Breaking the Vicious Cycle" (Kirkton 

              Press, Kirkton, Ontario, Canada). <br>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Excerpts from 

              letter to Elaine Gottschall :"P. was born on September 6, 1976. 

              For the first 15 years his life was active and fulfilled.. Other 

              than hay fever in the early summer months, P. had been relatively 

              healthy. But in the Fall of 1991 we noticed a drastic change in 

              his eating habits, energy level, motivation, and weight. His condition 

              became worse every day and although repeated visits to P.'s pediatrician 

              yielded no results, we persisted. In the spring of 1992, we obtained 

              a referral to a specialist. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May 1992, 

              P. was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and referred to a relatively 

              new gastroenterologist at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. 

              As his condition deteriorated, P. was given medications such as 

              Mesasal, Asacol, and prednisone. Prescribed to relieve the inflammation, 

              these drugs generated other side effects. The only dietary recommendations 

              were to stay away from high fiber type foods such as broccoli, carrots, 

              cauliflower, nuts, etc. At this point, we talked to a number of 

              people about Crohn's disease and read as many articles as we could 

              find. All were very pessimistic, recommending to learn to accept 

              that this disease is for life and that there is no known cure other 

              than drugs and occasional surgery. The future did not look promising 

              for P. We were all very discouraged. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">P.'s condition 

              continued to deteriorate through the fall of 1992. In December 1992 

              P.'s new gastroenterologist, informed us that P.'s condition was 

              critical. His body was not responding to the drugs and upon our 

              return from our Christmas holidays, we would have to seriously consider 

              one of two options for P.: adopting an elemental diet regime (via 

              feeding tube) or surgery. We were all shocked and distraught by 

              the news. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, since 

              learning of P.'s condition, my sister-in-law, who has a keen interest 

              in preventive medicine, began researching Crohn's disease. She discovered 

              a number of articles and publications including the book "Food and 

              the Gut Reaction." She believed the diet was worth considering and 

              we had nothing to lose. P.'s condition was at its worse but the 

              testimonies in the book gave us some motivation and hope of a potential 

              recovery for P.'s suffering. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">P., my wife 

              and I all read the book. Although we carefully followed the recommendations 

              in the book, for the next three weeks P. still suffered episodes 

              of intestinal pain. But our patience and persistence paid off. P.'s 

              pain started to dissipate and his condition improved dramatically 

              over the next few weeks. </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our son has 

              now been on the diet for two years and we are happy to report that 

              his gastroenterologist confirmed that there is no sign of the disease 

              in his system. He has gained weight and grown approximately six 

              inches. He is extremely active-- playing tennis and hockey, cycling, 

              going to school, and holding down a part time job. He has applied 

              for university next fall. He has always been interested in nature 

              and science and aspires for a career in biotechnology. </font></p>

              #: 293302 S1/General Discussion </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

              Thank you for your e-mail. I am always impressed when I see a loved 

              one involved in the health of someone with this disease. My husband 

              has been very beneficial to me. I can not tell you how much he has 

              done to keep the mood up. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the 

              diet itself has granted health to a great many people, a good inner 

              sense of self is vital. Keep up the good work. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, about 

              the diet, you need to purchase a book, it was written by Elaine 

              Gottschall, a woman in Canada. Her four year old daughter was very 

              sick at one time so she took her to a doctor that was recommended 

              to her. He put her on this diet and in a year or two she was well. 

              She has never experienced any other symptoms and is now in her forties 

              with a house full of kids! This diet had such a profound affect 

              on her daughter that Elaine has dedicated her life to research and 

              helping others. Another gentleman who is a member of our discussion 

              group has been cured for 17 years. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although it 

              doesn't work for everyone, there have been so many positive results 

              that I feel the need to offer it whenever and wherever I can. There 

              is no MAGIC CURE of course. I have been on this diet myself for 

              a month now, along with a couple other members in our discussion 

              group. We support each other in this endeavor. So far I have had 

              a good response. The cramping and flatulence are gone and my BM's 

              are down to 3-4 a day as opposed to 7-9 a day.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I don't get 

              paid for offering this diet to others, I just know how much EVERYONE 

              would like to be well. Most MD's do not recognize this diet as valid, 

              and give a cold reception to the idea that the answers for some 

              can be so simple. By the way, after your wife achieves health again 

              she can start to eat some of the other foods again, in moderation. 

              It's nice to know that once we establish wellness we can eat the 

              yummy foods, although I plan to go very easy on the stuff that has 

              no real food value. I found the diet to be reasonable and not bad 

              at all. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's the book 

              info, the name of the book is "Food & The Gut Reaction", by Elaine 

              Gottschall, Kirkton Press. If you can not find it at your neighborhood 

              bookstore have them order it for you from the Baker & Taylor warehouse.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please let me 

              know if you or your wife would like to join our Crohn's Discussion 

              Group. Not everyone in the group is on the diet, but we all either 

              have Crohn's or have loved ones who do. Keep in touch! The Very 

              Best Of Luck To You, C </font></p>

              Dear Elaine, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your book 

              "Breaking the Vicious Cycle." The diet outlined in the book has 

              helped me so much. I have Crohn's Disease which caused me to experience 

              pain and constant diarrhea for 21 years before I started the diet. 

              After a few weeks on the diet I noticed a change. The pain slowly 

              disappeared. A few months later the diarrhea began to disappear, 

              and now after 6 months I have normal bowel movements most of the 

              time and NO pain or cramping whatsoever. No medication or surgery 

              has EVER given me this kind of healing! </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the first 

              time I can look forward to the future, a future that does not include 

              endless doctor visits, medical tests, and dangerous medications 

              that do not help. Before starting the diet I had been on prednisone 

              for 3 years. As a result my adrenal glands shut down, and when the 

              prednisone dose was lowered, the symptoms would return. This cycle 

              went on and on. The residual diet my doctors put me on did not help. 

              As a result of your diet I was able to taper off the prednisone 

              without a flare up of symptoms. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My husband, 

              who has been endlessly patient through all of this is enthusiastic 

              too. He can see the sparkle in my eye, the color in my cheeks, and 

              the ready smile on my face, He too, has a new vision of our future, 

              as he has a healthy wife he never knew before. Instead of holding 

              my hand through the days I couldn't get out of bed or hearing my 

              cries from the bathroom, he is happily planning a hiking vacation 

              this summer! Something that I could never do before, as I always 

              needed to be near a bathroom. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One gentleman 

              I know is also on the diet and now can manage his kids' hockey and 

              baseball games and return to University, while holding down a full 

              time job! He now has an opportunity to move on with his life. His 

              five children are seeing a happy father they never knew. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another gentleman, 

              who just started the diet spoke of the possibility of being able 

              to golf now. It won't make his handicap any better but he can play 

              the whole game without worrying about getting to the bathroom in 

              time! Thanks again for writing the book and for your countless consultations, 

              I owe you a debt of gratitude that I may not be able to repay in 

              full. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello Everyone, 

              <br>

              I have had ulcerative colitis for over twenty years, proctitis actually. 

              Just the last 7 inches of My colon were diseased. Late 94 I had 

              a scope done and it showed the usual 7 inches. About two months 

              ago, a flare up I had been having for about 2 years started to get 

              much worse. I was running to the toilet many times and I had the 

              blood and such. I went to a new GI and had a scope done and found 

              that the colitis had spread to the entire colon and that I now had 

              severe colitis. What a shock that was. I was started on steroids, 

              Imuran and increased Asacol. Nothing was helping. One night about 

              a week after the scope, I felt that I had better get to the hospital. 

              I went and was admitted right away. I had a blood infection and 

              had to be rushed to another hospital after three days. I was in 

              so much pain I wanted it to stop or die. I have had two kids and 

              always thought childbirth was painful, but this was much worse. 

              At Rochester hospital I developed a fistula and was having bowel 

              movements through my vagina. (I'm sorry, I know this is gross). 

              After a blood transfusion I was rushed into surgery. I now have 

              an illeostomy. I do not know how long it will take to get used to 

              having this. I get depressed at times and strange as it sounds I 

              grieve for my lost colon. A very nice thing is I no longer have 

              to run to the toilet all day and night. I eat what everyone else 

              eats. I only have to cook my fruits and vegetables. The main problem 

              is self image. With the fistula and ostomy intimacy is difficult 

              but I know with time this will work out. When I had the surgery, 

              the doctor left two inches of my rectum in case it would heal and 

              one day I could have the reconnection surgery. It still feels like 

              I have to have bowel movements and the doctor says this will happen 

              until the rectum heals. I followed the SCD diet for many months 

              and although it seemed to help for a short time I quickly got worse. 

              I know that we all want to heal from these damn diseases but I just 

              want to encourage everyone to please be careful! I almost died from 

              the perforation of my bowel. I was never very sick, just had the 

              proctitis for so long. Keep doctor visits and watch your symptoms 

              carefully. If the diet does not work for you, DO NOT FEEL GUILTY 

              !! I sure did. I am very glad that the diet helps so many people. 

              Very, very glad that some people are healing. I just do not want 

              anyone to get sicker or worse because they waited to seek medical 

              care or stopped medicines. I know this is a long note. I wish everyone 

              well! If anyone else on the list has an ostomy or anyone had a fistula 

              like what I have please e-mail me directly as I am no longer on 

              the SCD list. <br>

              Take Care Everyone and (early) Happy Holidays! <br>
