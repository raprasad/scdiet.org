                        Well, I wish I'd known about the SCD back then. But to 

                        really be most effective, I'd have to roll the tape back 

                        to about 1978 when I first developed symptoms. In retrospect, 

                        if I'd known about the diet _then_, I'd have done a lot 

                        less damage. My food intake then must surely have made 

                        things worse and worse. If only I could have "nipped it

                        acne, thus causing a candida overgrowth and perpetuating 

                        a vicious cycle leading to food allergies and U.C., forcing 

                        me to drop out of college for six years until I discovered 

                        the SCD and gained my health and strength back. I would 

                        have treated my acne with probiotics and diet changes 

                        instead. It's easy to get angry at doctors for not forewarning 

                        us about the overuse of antibiotics, and the possibility 

                        of colitis from taking tetracycline and eurythromyacin 

                        (this information is well documented in medical books) 

                        But now I'm armed with an even greater knowledge for the 

                        rest of my life. Who knows how I'd still be eating if 

                        I never acquired U.C. I'd probably still be eating fast 

                        food and frozen burritos and twinkies. The body has an 

                        amazing ability to heal itself over time, and we will 

                        be much better off in thirty years than if we had never 

                        acquired U.C./Chron's and learned of the SCD and how to 

                        eat for health. Our children will be healthier, too. Cathy</font></p>

                        Mike, I would have seen an alternative minded environmental 

                        ecology and nutritional MD to get the overgrowth of candida 

                        and molds under control. I would have gone on the anti-candida 

                        diet (similar to SCD but doesn't allow the sweets and 

                        cheese on SCD), I would have taken the right vitamins, 

                        herbs and probiotics for me. <br>

                        I haven't written in a year, but I couldn't resist this 

                        question. What I wish that I had known five years ago 

                        really has little to do with the diet itself, it more 

                        has to do with the lifestyle around the diet. What I wish 

                        that I had known was that in college I didn't have to 

                        take everything so seriously. That I didn't have to try 

                        to get good grades all the time and then beat myself up 

                        when I didn't. I wish that I had know that I was allowed 

                        to treat myself better. If I had known this and acted 

                        on it, I think that I would have fed myself better (not 

                        eating potatoes and ramen noodles all the time) and would've 

                        have had less stress which is what I consider one the 

                        biggest reasons for my disease. And also, I would have 

                        skipped taking that extra MMR shot that my university 

                        required. <br>

                        The theory that IBS, UC and CD are not separate diseases, 

                        but might actually be the same digestive disease, just 

                        a continuum from mild to severe intrigues me. I suffered 

                        with symptoms of IBS for years. The only treatment I received 

                        was antispasmodics to mask the problem. If I could rewind, 

                        I would take the problem seriously, search for the true 

                        underlying cause and make some major lifestyle changes. 

                        I was totally in denial about the level of stress I was 

                        under and I combined it with a poor diet of large amounts 

                        of everything forbidden on the SCD and embarassing amounts 

                        of sugar. I was also frequently sick with upper respiratory 

                        stuff during this time and took several rounds of antibiotics. 

                        I think the combination of the three did it for me. And 

                        antibiotics were definitely what finally tipped the scales 

                        from IBS to UC. My GP prescribed a course of high-powered 

                        antibiotics, even though he was well-acquainted with my 

                        history of IBS. Only two pills made me deathly ill. When 

                        I talked to a nurse at my gastro's office, she said it 

                        was one of the worst antibiotics he could have prescribed. 

                        From now on, I'll stay away from them unless I'm dying. 

                        Wish I'd known the damage they could do to friendly bacteria 

                        five or ten years ago.</font></p>

                        If it were me, I'd want to roll back the last 15 years. 

                        That long ago I contracted a very mild case of UC that 

                        was easily controlled with sulfasalizine. Eight years 

                        ago the UC returned with a vengange when I took NSAIDs 

                        and muscle relaxants for lower back spasms. If I knew 

                        eight years ago what I know now, I would not have taken 

                        all those meds for my back. Also I wouldn't have taken 

                        all the antibiotics for periodic sinus infections over 

                        those 15 years. (Instead I would have used the saline 

                        rinses that serve me so well now.) Would I have also cut 

                        way down on sugar, starches, and grains? Who knows, in 

                        hindsight? I doubt very much whether I would have begun 

                        baking with almond flour. It is regretable that the doctors 

                        would not stress more the dangers of NSAIDs and antibiotics, 

                        however. Bart</font></p>
