          The following appears in Dr. Mercola's Newsletter: <br>Complementary Medicine Sought by Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's) <p>

       Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are more likely to use complementary medicine
       therapies when they have had the disease for more than 10 years or have been repeatedly
       hospitalized. The most common reasons for using complementary medicine were the side
       effects associated with and the lack of effectiveness of conventional medicine. Standard
       therapies include corticosteroids, which are often accompanied by unwanted side effects,
       immunosuppressive drugs and/or surgery. <p>

       Am J Gastroenterol May 1998;93:697-701. <p>The following appears boldface in the newsletter:<b>

       [Dr. Mercola's] COMMENT: Patients are not stupid. They will only tolerate so much abuse by a
       discipline that is nearly clueless on the cause of most of the problems they treat.
       Fortunately, there are some very effective alternatives. If you know anyone with
       inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's, the first step is to order the book Breaking
       the Vicious Cycle by Elaine Gottschall. It can be ordered from Book People
       800-999-4650 #48480. It is the best single book on relieving this problem. One
       should also use Flora Source as a good bacteria. Most people will also need to be
       monitored by a gastroenterologist. Fortunately, our state has an excellent one. Dr.
       Brasco (847-253-6483) has an office in Arlington Heights and is one of the few
       natural medicine oriented gastroenterologists in the entire country. He is an
       excellent physician and I have worked with him with a number of patients and found
       his services to be exceptional. He is familiar with the Gottschall book and uses it in
       his practice. </b> <p> <a href="/||ARCHIVE_SUBDIRECTORY||/8resources/doctors.html">More SCD-friendly doctors here >> </a><br>

          <b>Why doctors don't like the SCD</b> (copied from today's <a href="/||ARCHIVE_SUBDIRECTORY||/community/">SCD listserve </a>discussion):<p>

Subject:  SCD- from a Doctor's Point of View <br>
Date:  Sun, 8 Apr 2001 04:58:33 -0400 

<p>Let me start by saying that I find many things disturbing about the practice of medicine today. It is too specialized, too commercialized, and too impersonal. <a href="/||ARCHIVE_SUBDIRECTORY||/1about/">Elaine�s contribution </a>is not just the diet, it is the science behind it, and the fact that it seems to work in almost all cases. 

<p>So why doesn�t the medical community and doctors accept it?

<p>I think that it might be helpful to try to understand SCD from a Doctor�s point of view.

<p>As has been pointed out in the list, doctors have not been trained in nutrition. Clearly it�s importance has not been recognized. Besides from a solution point of view, SCD is "messy". It is much easier to pop a pill and control dosages of medicine than to stick to the demands of preparing the foods for the diet.

<p>The track record for medicine over the last 150 years has been outstanding. I believe that life expectancy has more than doubled during that time. Medicines have played a key role, so why should a doctor change?

<p>Many have experienced arrogance in their doctors. Perhaps it comes from the power of control over life or death of their patients. There is a political statement that may apply here. "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely." On the flip side, if doctor�s were more involved with their patients emotionally it is likely that they would suffer more if their patient did not react to treatment or died.

<p>Doctors are marketed to by drug companies that cite "scientific studies"; studies, performed in a controlled environment. However, no group of independent researchers or doctors have yet done a study on the SCD in a controlled environment. I hope to influence that.

<p>Doctors get free samples of medications to hand out to their patients. Few doctors have ever seen Elaine�s book. Perhaps sending free copies of Elaine�s book to doctors might help.

<p>Doctors are leaving medicine because of the cost of insurance. With the cost of malpractice suits rising, insurance companies are raising their rates to a point when it can become prohibitive to practice medicine. Why should a doctor take a chance on some "unproven" treatment, diet or otherwise, then be sued if it doesn�t work?

<p>Most diets advertised and marketed are fads; some pseudo scientific scheme to enrich the advocate and help people lose weight. Why would a responsible doctor promote a diet; SCD is a diet. 

<p>If you find a doctor who despite all these concerns advocates SCD <a href="/||ARCHIVE_SUBDIRECTORY||/8resources/doctors.html">consider yourself lucky</a>. On the other hand your doctor should be convinceable of the effects of SCD if your symptoms are significantly reduced or even better, if you are cured. 

<p>More important, forget what other people say, if it works for you or your loved ones, that really is the best of all. 

<p>Hope this helps.
<br>
Stan
