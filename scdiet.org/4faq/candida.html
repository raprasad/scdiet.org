                    is a stubborn little fungus that creates a number of toxins

                    inflamatory bowel disease. Women with candida also have the

                    growth is promoted by the consumption of many of the things 

                    that are proscribed by the SCDiet. For example, sugar and 

                    starches. Additionally, you are supposed to avoid consumption 

                    of funguses and booze, because each of these things helps 

                    the fungus do its dirty business. Plus, the usual suspects, 

                    stress and general poor health, do wonders for candida. And 

                    avoid antibiotics and steroids like the plague!<br>

                    <br>

                    So, what to do? Some herbs kill candida (for example, pau 

                    d'arco); other herbs reduce inflammation (slippery elm), and

                    My sense from hearing about candida (which, by the way, is 

                    more properly pronounced CAN-dida, not can-DEE-da) for years 

                    and years is <br>

                    that it's a more prevalent problem than the hardcore medical 

                    line would say, but not nearly as ubiqitous as the many authors 

                    and product <br>

                    sellers and certain practitioners would have us believe. There's 

                    a lot of literature out there connecting every problem under 

                    the sun to <br>

                    candida without a whole lot of solid data to back it up. It's 

                    hard to diagnose, hard to say whether it's a cause or a result 

                    of another problem, and beware especially of self-diagnostic 

                    questionnaires. <br>

                    <br>

                    Hi Ted,<br>

                    <br>

                    Where have you been lately?<br>

                    <br>

                    I've been having a lot of problems with candida, my suggestion 

                    is that you get a FEW books on the subject. They vary widely. 

                    The best I've seen is a virtual encylopedia and the source 

                    of almost all my orthomolecular knowledge. It's called &quot;It 

                    could be allergy and it can be cured.&quot; It's not based 

                    around the scd diet, but the scd diet can be adapted to fit 

                    and the additional information on vital topics is very well 

                    covered: environmental factors, candida associated allergies 

                    and intolerances, the importance of rest, oxygen and sleep, 

                    as well as what medications to use and how to tell your doctor 

                    what to do ; just to name a few. Phillip Alexander is the 

                    author.<br>

                    <br>

                    Any good book on the subject should cover the following principles 

                    of treatment:<br>

                    <br>

                    1.Suppression of the yeast infection with a specific anti-candida 

                    medication. <br>

                    Nystatin at low to increasing dosage, Caprilic acid, Garlic, 

                    Fungilin, Nizoral<br>

                    <br>

                    2: Starvation of the yeast by diet modification: <br>

                    Elimination of Simple carbohydrates such as Honey, Lactose, 

                    Fruit Juices<br>

                    <br>

                    3: Avoidance of Yeast Promoting medications: <br>

                    broad spectrum anti-biotics, as well as immunosuppressants 

                    such as cortisone and imuran<br>

                    <br>

                    4: Resting the immune system by avoidance of yeast foods <br>

                    reducing the workload on the immune system enables it to have 

                    the energy to kill candida. This is a key factor. All the 

                    others just weaken the yeast. The immune system is the one 

                    that finishes it off, but only if it is energised enough. 

                    Eating yeast foods, tires out the immune system since it is 

                    forced to &quot;shadow box&quot; these invaders that mimic 

                    the candida. Yeast foods include: bread, all hard cheeses 

                    (only the DCCC allowed and the yogurt) wine beer and vinegar.<br>

                    <br>

                    5:Identification and avoidance of chemicals and other allergens 

                    <br>

                    reduce load on immune system caused by : <br>

                    car fumes; chemical pollutants; insecticides colours; preservatives; 

                    emulsifiers and food allergens as well as inhaled allergens.<br>

                    <br>

                    6: Avoidance of yeast spores. <br>

                    Mould spores are released invisibly by the millions into the 

                    air by mould in areas such as bathroom, kitchen and around 

                    leaking pipes in walls. Remove the mould or move out to a 

                    dry sunny spot.<br>

                    <br>

                    7: Vitamins and mineral supplement are vital for the program 

                    since candida taxes the bodies own reserves of vitamins and 

                    minerals. <br>

                    To do this on the diet, you must be on beans and lentils and 

                    peas. Daily and rotated to avoid getting an allergy and to 

                    get enough carbohydrates.<br>

                    <br>

                    You should build up a reserve of minerals for 4-6 weeks prior 

                    with the metabolism balancing diet (or a scd modified version 

                    there of) then get ready to follow all 7 factors at once. 

                    Only in this way can it be beaten.<br>

                    </font> 

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For those 

                    of you looking for a lab to test for parasites. The Institute 

                    of Parasitic Disease in Arizona has a great reputation for 

                    finding &quot;bugs&quot; that other labs do not detect, and 

                    much less expensive then Great Smokies Lab. I originally sent 

                    them a stool specimen about 7 months ago and and they found 

                    2 different parasites and a slight overgrowth of candida. 

                    2 Months prior to that, I was tested by a hospital lab which 

                    found nothing. I took an herbal formular called Botanefuge 

                    for 3 months, was retested and there was no sign of parasites. 

                    Unfortunately although giving up fruit and honey for 2 months 

                    and of course strict adherence to the SCD minus any yeast 

                    foods, such as mushrooms, alchohol, vinegar...and taking natural 

                    remedies for candida (caprylic acid), I still tested with 

                    a slight overgrowth. I've now been off of all fruit and honey 

                    .... for 4 months. I am going to be retested again next week 

                    to see if there is any progress in the candida area. To order 

                    a test kit call (602) 545-9236. It's about $15.00. You take 

                    your stool specimen and send to The Institute of Parasitic 

                    Disease. Their phone is (602) 955-4211. They will fax the 

                    results to any doctor you choose including a holistic doctor. 

                    The actual test is about $70.00. If you have any questions, 

                    e-mail me. <br>

                    Hope this helps, Lois (UC) </font>

                    <br>

                    <b>Ted,</b><br>

                    I am most definitely a candida sufferer, having a visible 

                    coating on my tongue for the last 30 years, bouts of athlete's 

                    foot, microscopic<br>

                    verification using a saliva test, and many other hallmark 

                    symptoms. I did a search on the net using &quot;candida&quot; 

                    and found a very thorough description of this syndrome under 

                    the heading of Citricidal. Their outline of the symptoms of 

                    Candida is exhaustive and brilliant but their product has 

                    not helped me at all.</font>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have 

                    also tried Colloidal Silver which is a highly controversial 

                    and highly touted cure all. A search on the net will bring 

                    up an<br>

                    unbelievable amount of info on this product with some very 

                    severe warnings on possible long term toxicity. I can't really 

                    say whether the silver has helped me or not. I have lately 

                    been doing unusually well. But my tongue is still coated.<br>

                    Good luck in your search. The candida link is explored on 

                    the Crohn's Colitis site. I have investigated the ideas of 

                    Dr. Hulda Clark.<br>

                    Her claim is that our bodies are comprised of 85% good bacteria 

                    and 15% bad bacteria, virus, fungi, etc. The good bacteria, 

                    particularly in the digestive tract, are well able to control 

                    the bad bacteria. When you toss a few antibiotics down there 

                    in the normal course of your life, you knock out some of the 

                    good bacteria. According to the medical profession, this is 

                    not a major concern, although scientifically correct. According 

                    to Hulda Clark, the body does not recover well from this assault. 

                    The balance is changed, now there are maybe 70% good bacteria 

                    and 30% bad. Add some sugar, which fungi thrive on, and you 

                    change the balance more. Dr. Clark declares that many of us 

                    are running on 85% bad bacteria and 15% good. Makes perfect 

                    sense to me. Great Smokies Labs will analyze this balance 

                    for those who so<br>

                    desire. One fellow on Compuserve was shocked to learn he had 

                    no Lactobacillus Acidophilus in his sample at all, despite 

                    months of intense supplementation with probiotics. The bad 

                    bacteria clearly had the upper hand in his case.</font>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I believe 

                    if you can regain the proper balance, you can get the Candida 

                    back under control and once again enjoy good health. Easier 

                    said<br>

                    than done. Elaine states that the diet will do this, but such 

                    has not been the case for me, at least not quickly. I am of 

                    the opinion that this<br>

                    disorder requires a comprehensive approach as previously outlined 

                    by our resident encyclopedic, Michael. I have found that the 

                    skin needs to be treated as well, particularly hands and feet. 

                    Perhaps reinfection is occurring through these modes. Particularly 

                    hands. I rinsed my hands using 6% hydrogen peroxide. I rinsed 

                    them twice and rubbed them together. On the second rinse, 

                    I was shocked to see white patches come up, exactly the same 

                    as comes up on my tongue with a hydrogen peroxide swishing. 

                    Finding the cure for these fungal patches has been a challenge, 

                    and of course is ongoing.</font>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At any 

                    rate this is the SCD site and not the candida site. I don't 

                    often post anymore as the diet was not the definitive answer 

                    for me.<br>

                    However it still forms the basis of everything else that I 

                    do while my personal search continues unabated. Also I find 

                    tremendous help from the various postings. My health improvement 

                    from the diet has been most remarkable, but has not been complete.<br>

                    Lately I have been doing really well in all aspects but have 

                    not been able to pinpoint exactly where the improvement is 

                    coming from, and also am not sure that it is permanent. I 

                    am keeping a detailed journal, and just hoping that this will 

                    keep up. As Rachel has stated, I am suspicious that I am predisposed 

                    to this disorder and may actually never be free of it. I am 

                    also by nature a renegade and have been exploring alternatives 

                    not acceptable to any intelligent and clear thinking being, 

                    especially not Elaine! but something is going right, at least 

                    for now.</font>

                  I wish the naturopath had been of more help to you, but your 

                  experience is the same as mine. I have been to several. One 

                  put me through an interview of more than an hour and then prescibed 

                  a homeopathic remedy which did nothing. They mean well and try 

                  hard and charge lots but that's about it, from my perspective. 

                  I agree with you that in following the diet, empty calories 

                  are eliminated. The food is packed with nutrition. Sheila's 

                  suggestion on using Ann Louise Gittleman as a focal point for 

                  diagnosing parasites is an interesting one, I have considered 

                  it and have sent away for the info but the cost is high for 

                  having a sample evaluated and then... will the remedies really 

                  work. I am all done with those avenues but hope you will give 

                  it a try and report back!!<br>

                    </font> According to Elaine, the diet will address candida 

                    and the problems associated with it. This is a problem which 

                    I suffer from, and if the diet<br>

                    cures it, it doesn't do it very quickly! However, I have found 

                    nothing else that works any better, or even comes close, so 

                    I stay with the diet. While not cured, many of my yeast related 

                    problems are now history and I will forever be grateful to 

                    Elaine for that and to the group as well. Also, my daughter 

                    follows the diet loosely and it has been enough to get rid 

                    of some of her yeast related problems as well. <br>

                    <br>

                    I think there was a post from someone objecting to &quot;candida&quot; 

                    as a subject but my personal opinion is that this subject 

                    is acceptable since this is in fact not a crohn's site but 

                    an scd site, and Elaine has stated that the diet will address 

                    candida. I hope that was stated gently enough to not be offensive, 

                    I'm afraid I'm not very tactful! <br>

                    <br>

                    I am always searching for backups to the diet that will put 

                    an end to this miserable disorder, specifically I still battle 

                    IBS. It seems to me that on days when I take the time to exercise, 

                    at least 1/2 hour and enough to work up a bit of a sweat, 

                    that the diet becomes more effective and I am better off for 

                    a few days. I know this is only common sense but maybe will 

                    help someone who is teetering on success as I am, but tottering 

                    plenty too. <br>

                    In the book, those with Candida are told to drastically reduce 

                    the amount of honey used.<br>

                    <br>

                    From what I have read in another book the following also should 

                    be followed:<br>

                    <br>

                    No bananas, melons or grapes or any dried fruits<br>

                    no canned or bottled fruit juices - only fresh squeezed (in 

                    moderation)<br>

                    fresh fruit (only 2 pieces per day).<br>

                    yoghurt (in small quantities)<br>

                    <br>

                    In general increase your intake of whole food complex carbohydrates 

                    (from vegetables)<br>

                    <br>

                    and yes the oxygen, not the sweat is more desirable, deep 

                    breathing (as for yoga) whilst gently walking is what is needed 

                    to deeply oxygenate the tissues without burning too many calories 

                    (losing weight )<br>

                    </font> I don't know, but the fungus loves it!! So many people 

                    are not aware of these little gangsters called CANDIDA. They 

                    sit in the gut and are just waiting for a chance to colonize 

                    the colon and ileum. That's what the youghurt is all about, 

                    get the good bugs in and let them conquer Candida and others. 

                    The most famous one - Candida Albicans - produce acetaldehyde 

                    from suger. And, here is one problem, many people don't even 

                    know that acetaldehyd is far more toxic than alcohol. Symtoms 

                    are headeach, joint pain, premenstrual syndrom. The target 

                    organ is the brain. Some people get scizzofrenia from this 

                    little fungus.<br>

                    <br>

                    Now Candida Albicans is a nice guy as long he is the minority, 

                    but as soon as he gets into position, he will change and grow 

                    ROOTS in the gut. And through the holes he creats in the gut, 

                    undigested food will come in contact with the immune defence 

                    behind the mucosa. The resoult is food allergi.<br>

                    <br>

                    Maybe I am just boring you with stuff you already know to 

                    well, but in my opinion there is time to focus on other words 

                    like SCD and carbohydrates on this list and also on the IBDLIst!<br>

                    I can't seem to beat the Candidaisis, and can't bear the thought 

                    of giving up fruit, cheese, etc. for a long time, so I thought 

                    I'd give Pro<br>

                    Biotics a try. I've been taking Nature's Biotics for about 

                    3 weeks or so, increasing the dosage as suggested on the bottle. 

                    For the past week or so I seem to be having a bit of a relapse. 

                    No -D-, but not normal either. I'm also sore in the areas 

                    were I know my crohn's is. Could<br>

                    this be the 'die off' I've heard several of you mention? I 

                    hadn't had any symptoms for about 9 months, so I'm fairly 

                    certain the Biotics are the cause, but I don't know if this 

                    is 'good' - cleaning out yeast, or a real relapse. I'm going 

                    to stop taking them for now, but if someone has had a similar 

                    experiance, please let me know.&gt;&gt;<br>

                    I too experienced exactly what you describe. The manufacturer 

                    suggests that you reduce the frequency of the capsules rather 

                    than eliminate them entirely. You should have gotten an instruction 

                    sheet explaining this. From the instructions, &quot;As Nature's 

                    Biotics begins working in the body, some people experience 

                    various stages of the natural healing process. This means 

                    that your body is doing its own work, so if you notice any 

                    signs of flu-like symptoms, fatigue, constipation, or diarrhea, 

                    etc., do not become discouraged and discontinue using the 

                    product. Simply reduce your dosage for a few days until you 

                    have moved through the condition. Rember, Nature's Biotics 

                    has no toxic side-effects. Any symptom described is a pro-benefit, 

                    in that it means your body is responding to the product and 

                    working to repair<br>

                    itself.&quot; You may want to review the instruction sheet. 

                    I have been taking Nature's Biotics since Nov. 14th last year 

                    and continue to do so with great success. </font></p>

                    If yeast has been isolated from lab tests, taking the Nature's 

                    Biotics doesn't give you a license to cheat from the anti-candida 

                    diet. Eating fruit will defeat the purpose of the probiotic 

                    if you have yeast . The probiotic should displace the yeast. 

                    Feeding the yeast while trying to elliminate it is not a good 

                    idea.<br>

                    <br>

                    A white tongue is not always a yeast indicator. I'll quote 

                    from Pre. for Nutritional Healing: &quot;Fungal infection 

                    of the mouth is referred to as oral thrush, a condition in 

                    which creamy-looking white patches form on the tongue and 

                    mucous membranes of the mouth. If the patches are scraped 

                    off, bleeding may result.&quot; A COATED tongue, on the other 

                    hand, is also white looking but not patchy and not on mucous 

                    membranes (cheeks, etc.) This can be an indication of the 

                    body trying to detox; some say it indicates liver function. 

                    (This could very well be the result of a diseased gut, or 

                    drugs- usually quite hard on the liver.) Hope this clears 

                    up any possible confusion. <br>

                    The SCD looks to be a good anticandida diet too though because 

                    candida thrives on sugars. The candida sites I have been to, 

                    although not so specific in diet are similar in many ways. 

                    <br>
