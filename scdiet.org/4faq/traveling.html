              I'm going on travel next week and am wondering how to deal with 
              the yogurt. I fly to Jackson, MS on Monday, drive to Natchez, work 
              all day, and then check in to the hotel. I'm there for 2 nights, 
              in Vicksburg for 2 nights, back in Jackson for 1 night, and fly 
              home. All the hotels have a fridge and microwave, but I'll be checking 
              out in the mornings and not checking into the next one until evening. 
              Will the yogurt be okay in a portable cooler with ice for the flight 
              down and for the in-between times? Will it last the week? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As far as the 
              rest of the food, I will have muffins, fruit, carrots, peanut butter, 
              boiled eggs (how long do they last?), Rochel's almond crackers, 
              cheese, tea bags, and fruit leather. Any other suggestions for portable 
              food? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I travel quite 
              a bit for my job, and usually in less ideal conditions than this. 
              This is my first trip since starting the SCD, so I figure the ease 
              of it is a good way to transition into future trips. By June, I 
              need to be able to travel around Utah, Arizona, and Nevada in the 
              summer sun, with possibly no fridges or microwaves in the hotels, 
              and certainly none on the 2-day trek through the Grand Canyon. If 
              anyone has any brilliant ideas about how to handle that trip, I'd 
              be all ears.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the way, 
              relating to a previous thread, I stopped taking Asacol about a week 
              ago and have seen a dramatic improvement in my bowel pattern since 
              then. I'm down to 2-3 per day, and the D is well on its way to being 
              a > thing of the past. This is amazing to me, since the last time 
              I can remember being D-free is in my previous life as a cat. No 
              trophies yet, but I'm hopeful. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another thought, 
              relating to the thread of a couple of days ago, I have been getting 
              exactly the same amount of sympathy and compassion since being on 
              the SCD as before. Especially as regards chocolate. Major sympathy 
              there. "Oh, you poor thing. You can't have chocolate???!!!!!!" Everybody 
              thinks I'm so strong, but I've never been such a big fan of chocolate 
              anyway. And like most of you, I think, the longer I'm on the diet, 
              the less I crave the bad stuff. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's all. 
              I appreciate everyone's support, even if I am mostly a lurker. And 
              MidasGold, your waffles are heavenly. I made extra and froze them 
              to use like Eggos (only better, of course) for breakfast. Yummy 
              with Rochel's jam. </font></p>

              Learn to live on less perishable and/or more &quot;readily-available&quot; 
              items. Examples include: raisins, nuts, cooked or raw vegetables, 
              etc. Bring snacks with you if you think you may get hungry before 
              the next SCD-legal meal can be found. I find that most &quot;Caesar 
              salads&quot; (even with the artificial dressing) are acceptable.

              My husband and I will be going to Lakemont, New York this weekend 
              to entertain a job application and we will be staying in a hotel 
              with our children. I hope to bring along my skillet and a hot pot. 
              I will bring a cooler with icepacks and in it I will bring yogurt, 
              eggs, bacon, maybe some frozen meat with mushrooms and I may pre-cook 
              some things before I go and heat them up when I get there. Just 
              some ideas for you. Good luck. - Charlene</font></p>

              Go to *good* restaurants that serve *real food*. That's all I can 
              suggest. If you can get to a supermarket, you could get some cheese 
              and nuts, if they have *fresh* nuts, and they would keep for a short 
              time in a cool hotel room. Christopher has traveled with a small 
              pressure cooker - again, if you could get to a supermarket really 
              easily, you could make yourself a dinner, but it's a lot of trouble 
              to go through for something you can't keep if you don't eat the 
              whole meal. Maybe a slow cooker would be better, as you might be 
              able to make something over night for brekkie, and leave it cooking 
              until evening... I *think* this would be safe.... </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hadn't thought 
              about it, but I, too, get major sympathy for being deprived of bagels, 
              pasta, chocolate, etc. <g> I *was* a major chocolate fan before 
              the diet, but very rarely indulged in it pre-SCD because I felt 
              it was major fattening :-). And you're right. The longer one is 
              on the diet, the less appealing all those illegals seem... Take

              Here's what my mom would do for our long car journeys back in India. 
              She always froze the yogurt. By the time we were ready for a lunch 
              picnic it was softened to an ice-creamy texture - absolutely delicious! 
              You may even place semi-frozen yogurt directly into a 'Thermos' 
              or 'Nissan' flask. I say semi-frozen because then it's easier to 
              scoop out and transfer into the flask. It looks crystally when frozen, 
              but that's probably just the whey. If you do decide to try the flask 
              method, DO NOT leave in the fridge with the flask lid screwed on. 
              Always transfer out the contents from the flask into another container 
              and then either place it again in the freezer section or the fridge 
              as you prefer. I personally do not travel without my Nissan flasks. 
              They are such a boon! Bon Voyage! - Suneeti</font></p>

              the 5-amino salicylic acid (Asacol) and the D stopping. Aint modern 
              medicine wonderful!!!! I'll let others who travel give you some

                own salad dressing in one of those bottles with level markings 
                for oil and vinegar so I could make more as needed.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brought muffins 
                and pre-measured ziplok bags of flour/baking soda and container 
                of honey for making muffins at campsite with fold up camp oven 
                (bought eggs/butter when needed). Muffins would keep for several 
                days.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brought and 
                bought (along the way) nuts and raisins.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bought bananas/apples/cheese 
                along way.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ordered fried 
                eggs at most diners and fresh vegetables (onions/peppers/tomatoes/no 
                milk/fresh eggs) omelets at small town owner operated diners off 
                beaten path where I could be sure nothing illegal was used. BTW, 
                people were great all across the country and I had no problem 
                getting things prepared right. One owner said she grew the tomatoes 
                and peppers herself!</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Occasionally 
                ordered plain hamburg/steak/chicken breast and fresh cooked plain 
                veggies if available.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ordered fresh 
                salads and used my own dressing.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drank only 
                bottled water and weak coffee.</font></li>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A year ago and 
              for a lot of years before that I could not have done this without 
              UC problems. For those of you just starting the SCD, stick with 
              it. It really does work. Some of us have to be patient while our 
              bodies heal (I think especially with UC), but it does keep getting 
              better.</font></p>
