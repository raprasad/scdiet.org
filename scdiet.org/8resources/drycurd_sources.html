                    stores will special-order dry curd upon request. Also, national chains don't always carry DCCC in your local area (but you can often make a special request). Keep in mind it might be in the &quot;deli&quot; cheese section, or the regular cheese section near the cream cheese or the block cheeses. Also, instead of buying DCCC through Amazon, we  advise people to do a search online for dairy farms closest to them, and   calling them to ask which stores order dry curd cottage cheese on on a regular basis, which will help you locate a local supplier and help you save money.</b></font></p>

                        of 2004, Friendship &quot;is closing down much of the 
                        production of the Hoop and, therefore, SCDers are left 
                        mainly with Farmers. The Hoop will still be available 
                        in delies in NYC, etc. but may eventually disappear even 
                        from these places. That is OK as my conversation with 
                        the dairy scientist at Friendship has led me to believe 
                        SCDers are just fine with Farmers.&quot; Here's a <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_UnhrXrqyacQ/SzQ3CuXRkTI/AAAAAAAABF8/3y_B1RBkYrc/s720/DCCC.jpg">photo</a> 
                        of what it looks like. Many Russian delis in major US 
                        cities  
                        carry the Friendship brand. As well, check their web site

                          of production. He informed me that they use milk from 
                          Amish farms in the area. The method is old world traditional: 
                          culture, drain and boil the milk with out adding anything 
                        else (sugar, salt, cream, milk etc.) to it.&quot;</p>
                        <p>According to Anna, &quot;I found Friendship brand Farmer Cheese, both salted and unsalted, at Bristol Farms on Genesee in San Diego. I have recently called around and gone in to the listed San Diego Henry's stores and they no longer carry DCCC.&quot; <br>
