                          Rachel Turet posted this introduction on behalf of Purdue: 
                          &quot;I am a Doctor of Oriental Medicine practicing 
                          in the State of Florida. I was frustrated with the the 
                          slow response I was getting with patients suffering 
                          from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn's, Ulcerative Colitis, 
                          and so on. A lot of what we had to offer was superior 
                          to the drug approach, in that we were able to make some 
                          positive improvements rather than only the "managing 
                          symptoms" approach offered by conventional medicine 
                          with drugs like prednisone. However, symptoms such as 
                          abdominal bloating and discomfort still plagued many 
                          of my patients. I had the opportunity to hear an interview 
                          with Elaine Gottschall a few years ago, read "Breaking 
                          The Vicious Cycle," and began using this diet as the 
                          cornerstone to the majority of my gut disease patients. 
                          It transformed my practice. Between using various Traditional 
                          Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas, targeted nutritional 
                          supplements where appropriate, acupuncture as needed, 
                          and various other protocols, many patients have been 
                          saved from a lifetime of misery. I cannot express how 
                          grateful I am to Elaine Gottschall and the valuable 
                          research she has contributed. Unfortunately, much of 
                          conventional medicine is still stuck in the outdated 
                          notion that diet has little to do with disease. I'm 
                          glad that people like Elaine Gottschall has enabled 
                          practitioners like me to offer hope to those dissatisfied 
                          with "the system." I would be happy to answer any questions 
                          to anyone curious about what I do in my clinic.&quot;

                          ask him about a symptom and then went on a business 
                          trip without getting to talk to him - he called me back 
                          regularly for two weeks to try to get a hold of me - 
                          he even called on a Sunday!!! And he's the Director 
                          of Gastroenterology at the Hospital - a very busy man! 
                          It will take over a month to get an appt, but it's worth 
                          it, I think. Then again, I never had any other gastro.

                          and discuss things. He is not a proponent of SCD, but 
                          is willing to admit that he has patients who swear by 
                          it. He did not discourage me from trying it, just said 
                          that it's hard to maintain over the long term. When, 
                          after four months on the SCD, almost all my ulceration 
                          had disappeared, I jokingly said to him that I imagined 
                          he thought the diet had nothing to do with it, and he 
                          jokingly said that it &quot;could have been the medication 
                          too&quot;.. knowing that I'd been on the medication 
                          for three years to no good effect. The point being that 
                          he's not negative about alternative treatments. I like 
                          him because he's responsive and communicative..&quot;

                          as SCD covered all the bases nutritionally, if I was 
                          feeling better being on it then I should stick with 
                          it. He also thought the list was a great idea, particularly 
                          since patients with Crohn's and colitis can have such 
                          varied experiences. Dr. Elkashab is affiliated with
