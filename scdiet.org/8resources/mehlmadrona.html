                        am writing to introduce myself. I joined this list at 

                        the suggestion of my friend, Fia Richmond, who wanted 

                        me to learn about these ideas. I have been enjoying the 

                        posts and learning more and more. </font></p>

                        and alternative medicine. Besides three family physicians,

                        us, we will both be very familiar with what you are doing 

                        and how to support your needs. </font></p>

                          Dr. Mehl-Madrona, Welcome to the list. I'd like to thank 

                          you for taking an interest in this diet, which has helped 

                          so many of us. I do not live near New York City, but 

                          if I did I would certainly be making an appointment 

                          with you and volunteering to help with your study in 

                          any way that I possibly could. If there is any way that 

                          I can help from Ontario, just say the word! Janice<br>

                          <br>

                          to Fia Richmond, &quot; Beth Israel Medical Center has 

                          opened a new department as of June 1st, 2000. The Center 

                          for Health and Healing has Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona, author 

                          of Coyote Medicine, as their program director. Dr. Mehl-Madrona 

                          has been my son's doctor for several years now and I 

                          highly recommend him. He is one of the most open-minded 

                          physicians that I have come upon. He also advocates 

                          a strong spiritual component to his philosophy of healing. 

                          He has continually supported and encouraged the SCD 

                          diet with my son. You can learn more about him and access

                          Dear Dr. Lewis MM from ElaineGottschall, <br>

                          You refer to "scientific studies" and I am not sure 

                          what you mean. Doctors, some in New York City, Like 

                          Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Galland plus many others, have treated 

                          out-patients to find them recovering from UC and Crohn's 

                          after years of suffering.Of course, they have their 

                          medical records before and after. <br>

                          While at Rutgers Univ. the Dept. of Nutrition had people 

                          coming into the dining room of the Dietary Dept. for 

                          3 meals a day. They also required stool and urine specimens 

                          for the study they were doing. The only problem was 

                          that these subjects would go home and eat whatever they 

                          pleased without reporting. Obviously, this is not a 

                          controlled study. Dr. F. C. Dohan (whom I reference 

                          in my chapter on the brain) used a similar diet when 

                          his schizophrenic patients were locked up and all food 

                          was really controlled and he found that those on the 

                          restricted diets were released in about half the time 

                          of those that ate the normal food. The only thing I 

                          can think of is to get subjects who are willing to check 

                          into a sort of sanitorium (spa) and stay there with 

                          someone doing all the cooking. It would have to be a 

                          pleasant setting but one where they had no access to 

                          other food. I can understand why many researchers work 

                          on the level of testubes or one molecular enzymatic 

                          action rather than take on the whole person. The alternative 

                          doctors as well as some medical doctors have found that 

                          the Specific Carbohydrate Diet works as an adjunct to 

                          their care. Some doctors do not even use supplements 

                          such as grapefruit seed extract or bother with sensitivity 

                          tests but put the people on the diet and check them 

                          out weekly using blood tests, etc. The sicker the patient 

                          is, the more some rely on the diet solely as well as 

                          any medication they may be on and with weekly checkups, 

                          the medication is most often reduced. <br>

                          The diet must be carefully controlled as I found that 

                          even some of the laboratories are sending out elemental 

                          diets which are far from elemental. They use maltodextrin 

                          as a carbohydrate source which is a very difficult molecule 

                          to digest because of the scarcity of the isomaltase 

                          enzyme on intestinal microvilli. . The researchers come 

                          up with all kinds of excuses not to use dextrose as 

                          a carbohydrate source (which would truly make the carbs 

                          elemental) because of the osmolality getting to high. 

                          <br>

                          Without going into details now, this is a lame excuse. 

                          <br>

                          I appreciate your interest in the work I have been doing 

                          for 40 years and hope that with your assistance we can 

                          make this nutritious diet an option, at least, for those 

                          not doing well on traditional treatment. Let me know 

                          what you want me to do next. With best wishes, Elaine
