Dear Friends,
<P> ABC News just aired an explosive report on the FDA's failure to evaluate 
 properly recombinant bovine growth hormone (BGH) drug. The story can be
 accessed right on the front page at ABC's web site,

<P> Consumer Group Launches Action Against FDA 
 

<P> By John McKenzie

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

<P> A genetically engineered drug called bovine growth hormone (BGH) has been
 given to 30 percent of U.S. dairy cows over the last five years to make them produce more milk.
 

<P> There has been indirect evidence that BGH might contribute to breast and
 prostate cancer in humans, and today a consumer group called the Center 
 for
 Food Safety began legal action to have the hormone pulled off the market. 
 CFS
 is charging that the Food and Drug Administration has ignored evidence of
 potential health hazards from BGH.
 

<P> Twice a month, genetically engineered BGH is injected into 3 million dairy
 cows in the United States. The milk these cows produce is then shipped
 throughout the country as milk, cream, cheese and yogurt, and in baked and
 other goods. Products from cows that receive BGH are almost never labeled 
 as
 such.
 

<P> The FDA concluded that milk from these hormone-treated cows is &quot;safe for 
 human
 consumption.&quot; <BR>But a recent review of the evidence challenges the FDA's
 conclusion. 
 

<P> Company Supplied Data &quot;It was their job to take a careful look at every
 study,&quot; says Andy Kimbrell from the Center for Food Safety. &quot;We now know 
 they
 did not do so.&quot;
 

<P> When the FDA approved bovine growth hormone, it relied in part on an
 unpublished animal study done by the Monsanto Corp., the same company that
 wanted to sell the hormone.
 

<P> The FDA publicly reported the study's results, saying that rats fed high 
 doses
 of the hormone over a 90-day period showed no evidence they had absorbed 
 the
 hormone. 
 

<P> Canadian Study Showed Risks In Canada, where the use of BGH is now being 
 hotly
 debated, government scientists recently reviewed all the data from the
 Monsanto study, and came up with startlingly different conclusions.
 

<P> The Health Protection Branch of the Canadian government says the Monsanto
 study actually provided evidence that 20 to 30 percent of the rats did 
 absorb
 the hormone into their bloodstream. The Canadian scientists say that the 
 data
 also showed that some male rats developed cysts in the thyroid, and that
 higher levels of the hormone were detected in the prostate.
 

<P> Five government scientists in Canada had enough questions about the 
 safety of
 BGH that they recently took the unprecedented step of making their 
 concerns
 known to the public.
 

<P> &quot;If it wasn't for the Canadian government researchers, we probably never 
 would
 have known the full results of this 90-day rat feeding study,&quot; says 
 Michael
 Hansen of Consumers Union. &quot;It should have triggered long-term toxicity
 testing, but the FDA did not require that testing.&quot;
 

<P> The FDA declined ABCNEWS requests for an interview. As for Monsanto, it
 maintains that the hormone is safe, and that milk from cows treated with 
 the
 hormone is no different from any other.
 

<P> But Vermont's two senators are not so certain. They have now asked Donna
 Shalala, secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, to
 formally investigate the FDA's approval of BGH and whether the agency
 &quot;overlooked&quot; important evidence about its safety.
