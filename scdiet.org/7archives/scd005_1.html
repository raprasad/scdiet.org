<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>SCD Mailing List Addresses at Maelstrom St. Johns</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
The following e-mail addresses are used in relation with this list:<BR>
<BR><BR>
<B>1.</B> The list address: <TT><A HREF="mailto:scd@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">scd@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A></TT><BR>
<BR>
Messages sent to this address go to all list members. This is called &quot;posting&quot;
to the list. The list address should never be used for administrative requests
regarding your subscription or questions about the list server, as this
would unnecessarily annoy other list subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
You can only post to the list from the account under which you are subscribed.
If your post is rejected for no apparent reason, contact one of the listowners
listed below.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<B>2.</B> The listserv address: <TT><A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A></TT><BR>
<BR>
This is the address to which you sent your subscription request, and it
should be used for all requests that can be handled automatically by the
LISTSERV program. This includes changing your name or address, unsubscribing,
changing your subscription options, retrieving files from the file server,
searching the list archives, etc. You will find a list of the most commonly
used LISTSERV commands in the next section.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<B>3.</B> The listowners' addresses:<BR>

John Chalmers &lt;<TT><A HREF="mailto:johnc@serv2.fwi.com">johnc@serv2.fwi.com</A></TT>&gt;<BR>

<BR>
These are the people in charge of keeping the list running. If you have
any technical or administrative problem that you cannot solve with LISTSERV
commands, contact one of the listowners. This would include problems such
as having your postings to the list rejected, or if you think some SCD messages
don't get through to you. (If you contact multiple list owners with the
same message, please denote that fact in your message.)<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Common Listserv Commands</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
This file describes some of the common commands that you may need to send
to the LISTSERV. You can generally send any number of commands in a single
message, as long as each is on a separate line.<BR>
(Exceptions to this rule will be noted.)<BR>
<BR>
This is not a complete list of commands, and many of these commands have
other options not discussed here. More information about LISTSERV and database
search commands is available: see the &quot;INFO&quot; command described
below.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Remember</B> to send commands to <B><TT>listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</TT></B>;
don't send them to <B><TT>scd@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</TT></B>, which is the
address where you post messages for everyone else to read.<BR>
<BR>
LISTSERV expects you to write the commands in the <B><TT>body of the message</TT></B>,
rather than in the message subject, because some users have no control over the
contents of the &quot;Subject:&quot;-field on outgoing messages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The common commands are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#anchor133576">Subscribe</A> <BR>
<A HREF="#anchor135065">Signoff</A><BR>
<A HREF="#anchor135520">Set mail</A> <BR>

<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor133576"></A><B>SUBSCRIBE SCD YourFirstName YourLastName</B><BR>
<BR>
This is the command you used to subscribe to the SCD mail list. Your subscription
address is automatically detected, so you do not need to enter it. You will
only be allowed to post from that address.<BR>
If you want to post from more than one account, you can subscribe from several
addresses and set all but one to &quot;NOMAIL&quot;, as explained below.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SUBSCRIBE SCD YourFirstName YourLastName&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor135065"></A><B>SIGNOFF SCD</B><BR>
<BR>
This command removes you from the SCD list. If you are forced to change
Internet providers and cannot unsubscribe from your old e-mail address,
please send an e-mail note to the listowner and he will unsubscribe you
from your old e-mail address.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SIGNOFF SCD&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor135520"></A><B>SET SCD MAIL</B><BR>
<BR>
Sets your subscription option so that you receive each message as it is
posted. This is the default setting when your subscription begins.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SET SCD MAIL&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor136491"></A><B>SET SCD NOMAIL</B><BR>
<BR>
Sets your subscription option so that you will receive no mail from the
list. You are still able to post messages to the list. This is useful if
you have more than one account, or if you want to leave the list temporarily
(e.g. when going on vacation). Use &quot;SET SCD MAIL&quot; or &quot;SET
SCD DIGEST&quot; to go back to normal.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SET SCD NOMAIL&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor136715"></A><B>SET SCD DIGEST</B><BR>
<BR>
Sets your subscription option to digest. Instead of receiving each message
as it is posted, you will receive one daily message with all postings for
that day. If you use this feature, do not use the reply feature of your
software or the entire digest may be re-sent to the whole subscriber list!
Instead, a new message should be created with the applicable information
and comments.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SET SCD DIGEST&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor137454"></A><B>SET SCD NODIGEST</B><BR>
<BR>
Sets your subscription option to individual messages instead of receiving
a daily digest. You will receive each message as it is posted.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SET SCD NODIGEST&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor137925"></A><B>QUERY SCD</B><BR>
<BR>
This returns a summary of your current subscription options. If it appears
that the SCD list is no longer sending you messages, you should issue the
&quot;QUERY SCD&quot; command to determine your status:<BR>
<UL>(1) If the returned information shows NOMAIL and NOPOST this change
was probably due to error notices caused by your e-mail address.<BR>
You can return to receiving normal mail with the &quot;SET SCD MAIL&quot;
command (see the description above).<BR>
<BR>
There are many reasons why your e-mail address may be causing error notices,
including a full mailbox or transmission problems along the pathway. The
high volume of error notices we get makes it impossible for us to research
every notice. We do try to warn you of the problem, but usually you will
not receive our warning for the same reason that the error notice is being
generated. If the bounced message appears to be temporary, the ID is set
to digest mode.
<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;QUERY SCD&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
</UL>
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor138275"></A><B>INDEX SCD</B><BR>
<BR>
This returns a list of all the SCD files available from the file server.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;INDEX SCD&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor138843"></A><B>GET SCD WELCOME</B><BR>
<BR>
This retrieves a named file from the file server, eg. GET SCD WELCOME will
retrieve this welcome message.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;GET SCD WELCOME&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor139629"></A><B>INFO</B><BR>
<BR>
Returns a list of LISTSERV help files. Send &quot;INFO REFCARD&quot; for
a reference card on LISTSERV commands.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;INFO REFCARD&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>

<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor169629"></A><B>Dual headers</B><BR>
<BR>
Dual Headers helps you to see the email-addresses of the senders on the list mail you 
recieve. NB: One downside to this option is one must
trim out this second header when replying, or the reply will be bounced
back by the Listserv.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SET SCD DUALhdr&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>


<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor169630"></A><B>Subject header</B><BR>
<BR>
With this option turned on, you will get an [SCD] at the
beginning of every subject line. For those of us that use filters, this
just uses up part of the subject that is displayed in a window. But for
those that dump all incoming mail into one mailbox, this will quickly
identify which mail comes from this list.<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;SET SUBJecthdr&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>


<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor140387"></A><B>Database Search</B><BR>
<BR>
The SCD archives can be searched by sending a query to the listserv. You
can obtain a help file with the following command to the listserv: GET SCD
DBSEARCH<BR>
<BR>Write &quot;GET SCD DBSEARCH&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><CENTER><HR WIDTH="140"></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor140388"></A><B>Archived letters</B><BR>
<BR>
The archive files for the SCD list at MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU (monthly logs) can be
obtained by sending a query to the listserv. For instance:<BR>
<BR>If you wish to let the logfile of June 1997, you write 
&quot;GET SCD LOG9706&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
<BR>If you wish to let the logfile of July 1997, you write 
&quot;GET SCD LOG9707&quot; in the body of the message and send
it to: <A HREF="mailto:listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A>.
<BR>
Etc...<BR>

<B>Re: Which address to post to SCD list ?</B><BR>

<BR>
Daniel Woods &lt;dwoods@ACS.UCALGARY.CA&gt; asked:<BR>
<TT>&gt;I read the listserver instructions and it says to use<BR>
&gt;&quot;SCD@MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU&quot;, which is what I am doing now.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Can someone tell me which is the correct address to use ?</TT><BR>
<BR>
The list has been transferred to St. Johns University in Queens, NYC. The
list is now running on Listserv software, with all its bells and whistles.<BR>
So the correct address is now <A HREF="mailto:SCD@MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU,">SCD@MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU</A>.
This is a permanent change as St. Johns will host this list indefinitely.<BR>
<BR>
St. Johns hosts more than 400 public mailing lists. Many of them are support
lists. All posts are being archived and are publicly available both on the
web and via e-mail. Very nice search capabilities are available -- when
there is something to search. Our past message web site can be found at:<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/scd.html">http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/scd.html</A><BR>
<BR>
Listserv software also allows for storage of FAQ-like files which can be
downloaded by e-mail. Right now there really isn't anything there. These
can include recipes or anything that is appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
The list is set up to review people's first post. This is done for spam
control. So there may be a small delay on people's first post. Once off
review posts should be broadcast immediately.<BR>
<BR>
Initially no one is set to Digest, but this is an option that is explained
in the Welcome message.<BR>
<BR>
I am the technical advisor on eight mailing lists at St. Johns, all diet
related. If anybody has any questions about Listserv software they can write
to me privately.<BR>

<B>Greetings</B><BR>
Tue, 24 Jun 1997 5:07:17 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi All<BR>
<BR>
I hope that you are not too confused by the move we are making. I will try
to summarize what is happening.<BR>
<BR>
Recently we restarted the group using a mail forwarding system at scd@app.fwi.com<BR>
<BR>
That was intended to be a temporary setup until we could move permanently
to a listserver. My internet provider had promised to be able to provide
this service. That did not work out, unfortunately.<BR>
<BR>
With the good help of Don Wiss, we now have a listserver set up at St. John's
University. Our address is scd@maelstrom.stjohns.edu<BR>
<BR>
Hopefully this will be a good home for us for a long time to come.<BR>
<BR>
We have taken the mailing list we built over at scd@app.fwi.com and have
moved it to the listserver at St. John's. When we did this you should have
gotten a greeting message welcoming you and explaining some aspects of the
service.<BR>
<BR>
If you have any problems or questions, go ahead and email me directly and
I will try to resolve.<BR>
<BR>
John<BR>

Subject: <B>Re: sign with your e-mail address</B>

<BR>
<BR>
Anna &lt;benkea@MAILHOST.PAC.DFO.CA&gt; asked:


<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;I have noticed that with this new list, when we send a message to the list,<BR>
&gt;everyone on the list receives it, but the author's e-mail address does not<BR>
&gt;appear as the sender.  Rather, the list address appears as the sender.</FONT>

<BR>
<BR>
Correct. But the author appears in the From field. If this is not what is
happening in your case, an alternative to Digest mode (which I, like Mik,
prefer) is Dual Headers. To turn them on, send in to the
<A HREF="mailto:LISTSERV@maelstrom.stjohns.edu">LISTSERV@maelstrom.stjohns.edu</A> 
address SET SCD DUALhdr. This should really
be in the Welcome message, but the Welcome message was cloned from a list
that has DUALhdr as the default. One downside to this option is one must
trim out this second header when replying, or the reply will be bounced
back by the Listserv.

<BR>
<BR>
There is another new option that also should be in the Welcome. That is
SUBJecthdr. With this option turned on, you will get an [SCD] at the
beginning of every subject line. For those of us that use filters, this
just uses up part of the subject that is displayed in a window. But for
those that dump all incoming mail into one mailbox, this will quickly
identify which mail comes from this list.

<BR>
<BR>
Also, if you subscribe to other mailing lists running on a Listserv, all of
the same options are available on each, with the exception that SUBJecthdr
was new for version 1.8c.

<BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Therefore, if anyone wants someone to reply to their message privately, they<BR>
&gt;should include their own e-mail address within the message text.
</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Not necessary. Most people have it already in the From field, for those
that don't I'd rather they use one of the two options above.

<BR>
