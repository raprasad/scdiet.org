<HR><BR>
Thank you for calling and offering support for this long crusade that my
husband and I have carried on.<BR>
	I kept copying letters until I got tired.  There have been 100's of others
who have written and 100's who have called to report the good news but have
not written although I have asked them to do so.<BR>
In addition, it is most probable that only one in 100 will even contact
me.  We have sold 115,000 books and people keep passing books around.  In
addition, doctors are using it (mainly holistic, chiropractors, and naturopaths)
and some have copied parts of the book and distributed same to patients.
 So all in all, I imagine there must be at least 50,000 people who are leading
more normal lives after the diet has helped.<BR>
	We have seen that it has not budged the powers-to-be so all we can do is
keep plugging on.  So many medical doctors have used the diet on their wives,
children, and themselves.  Many have recovered but yet they do not tell
their patients.  I have other articles written by people who have gotten
so angry that they have accused Crohn's and Colitis as waging some kind
of conspiracy.  One woman is a novelist and while reviewing a book, injected
a condemnation of the Crohn's and Colitis Assoc.  She is being punished
by the paper as she has had no reviews offered to her since.  I have not
included articles such as these as they can make you very angry and that
will not accomplish anything.  What you intend to do sounds much more positive.<BR>
	Keep in touch and keep getting better.<BR>

This file is a compilation of Testimonials that I have gathered over the
past several months from people who have tried or are trying the Specific
Carbohydrate Diet.  Also, I asked for and received a group of letters that
were written to Elaine herself from other people on her diet.  The intention
of this compilation is to &quot;spread the word&quot; on the diet and let
people know that there might be an alternative to Surgery and/or Medication.

Hi,  I'm responding to your note on the Gotschall diet.  I've been using
<BR>
it for about 4 months with reasonable success.  When I started it I had
<BR>
instant success for about 2 weeks.  Then I started to get my diarrhea <BR>
back 2 or 3 times a week and couldn't figure out why as I do stick to the
<BR>
diet fairly fastidiously.  That has slowly improved and twice now I've <BR>
managed to go nearly two weeks without problems.  But I do still get <BR>
diarrhea for no apparent reason.  I did read that as the undesirable <BR>
bacteria in the gut die they release toxins. Perhaps this could explain
<BR>
the diarrhea.  I also take 1 tablet of lactodolphilus daily, I started that
<BR>
about 6 weeks ago and saw an improvement.  I'd be interested to know how
<BR>
you follow the diet as it is a bit restrictive.  I'm using it to cope with
my <BR>
chronic diarrhea that was diagnosed as IBS how about you?<BR>

<BR>
Basically, you only eat monosaccharides which means simple sugars, so that<BR>
everything is digested with no leftovers, like fiber. These leftovers are<BR>
believed to feed to bacterium and &quot;flora&quot; in your intestines which
then can<BR>
get out of control (the bad ones) and make further digestion even harder.<BR>
Their overabundance causes them to produce extra mucus which covers up the<BR>
microvilli which break down complex sugars. So more is undigested, they
eat<BR>
more, they grow more, a &quot;vicious cycle.&quot; My GI said he thinks
the theory<BR>
has some validity, but no controlled studies have been done, so no proof,<BR>
and not everyone who you would think would benefit does. Hence, the<BR>
experimental side of it.<BR>
<BR>
What you can eat:<BR>
fruit and vegetables, cooked only at first until you can tolerate more;<BR>
nuts when you can tolerate them;<BR>
some beans (lentils and white navy) when you can tolerate them;<BR>
meat;<BR>
milk products without lactose, like hard aged cheeses (cheddar, colby,<BR>
swiss); homemade yogurt (real easy and good!), a few others;<BR>
honey.<BR>
<BR>
No-Nos:<BR>
refined sugars;<BR>
wheat and other flours -- NONE at all;<BR>
most beans;<BR>
potatoes;<BR>
lactose milk products;<BR>
chocolate (of course).<BR>

<BR>
From: JMP<BR>
<BR>
The basic rules of the Gottschall diet are to avoid all disaccharides<BR>
and polysaccharides (most sugars and starches).  The theory (explained<BR>
in the book) is that these long-chain molecules cannot be broken down<BR>
in our guts into their smallest units - monosaccharides - which are<BR>
absorbed into the blood.  If these are not broken down by our bodies,<BR>
bacteria in the gut can eat them and grow out of control.  So, if we<BR>
only each monosaccharides, we can absorb them without needing to break<BR>
them down and the bacteria starve.<BR>
Among the things to avoid are: bread, cereals, pasta, and anything<BR>
else made with flour; rice, potatoes, anything with added sugar or<BR>
starch (most canned/processed foods); most dairy products (lactose is<BR>
a disaccharide).  Your diet is mostly fresh/frozen meat, fish,<BR>
vegetables, and fruit.  You can also eat nuts, eggs, and some cheeses.<BR>
The book includes recipes such as breads, cakes, and cookies made with<BR>
nut flour.<BR>
Overall, it is NOT an unhealthy diet.  However, it would be difficult<BR>
for vegetarians because tofu and most soy-based products cannot be<BR>
eaten, so protein can be harder to come by.  I've been on it for over<BR>
a year and am symptom free as long as I don't cheat.  It doesn't work<BR>
for everyone, but I cannot think of any reason not to give it a shot.<BR>

I have been using the Gottschall Diet to help control UC since Oct.94...
<BR>
There is a specific *bland* diet listed in her book, but it's totally <BR>
different from what is normally considered bland... When I have a flair,
<BR>
I resort back to that diet and it helps ease the problems... <BR>
  I had was having very severe problems about a year ago and was put on
<BR>
Rowasa to help calm the bleeding and D...  I couldn't use the enemas...
<BR>
As soon as administered, it felt like I'd been jabbed with an ice pick...<BR>
<BR>
   Since following the diet, I have responded better to ALL medications...<BR>
 I had to use the Rowasa again just a couple of weeks ago, and this time
<BR>
I only had a problem on the second night... After that, there was no pain
<BR>
when using the medication... <BR>
   Hope this info is helpful...<BR>

I have been using the Gottschall Diet since Oct. 94... I have <BR>
Ulcerative Colitis, and was not having much luck with any meds <BR>
before starting this diet... In the last few months, I have <BR>
started experimenting with foods that were once restricted from <BR>
the diet, and having success... I am currently on Asacol, Bentyl <BR>
and Rowasa and just watching what I eat and am nearly symptom <BR>
free... I have two or three trips to the bathroom in the morning <BR>
and then I'm fine for the day... Two years ago, I was &quot;going&quot;
at <BR>
least once an hour...<BR>

dietary therapy for crohn's<BR>
This article submitted by d. h. on 11/9/95.<BR>
	I have had Crohn's for seven years, and my condition has progressively
deteriorated. Two months ago, I began the &quot;Gottschall&quot; diet, which
involves eliminating all carbohydrates (grains, complex sugars) and introducing
homemade yogurt (without lactose), among other things.  I am curious if
anyone has successfully treated their Crohn's disease through similiar dietary
methods. It worked immediately for me,coming out of a bad flare-up, but
I am also on Prednisone, and now that I am lowering my dosage (I'm currently
on 20 mg.), I am experiencing blood and mucus at the beginning of my bowel
movements, and my intestines feel obviously inflamed again.  However, the
diet claims that in the second or third month a relapse can occur, but I
also want to keep tapering the Prednisone and am frusterated at such a relapse.
Has anyone experienced a similiar occurance? And what foods have people
discovered they can and cannot tolerate? This is a crucial time; I feel
if I can get through this, then my intestines may actua<BR>
 keep heeling.  Advice?<BR>

I've had CD diagnosed for 13 yrs. I've also had several<BR>
operations. I stuck to a diet of no wheat, corn --nbot even traces of corn<BR>
flour or oil--milk, coffee, alcohol, dairy --none ofn tyhe above and had<BR>
much less cramps for about two yrs. But unfortunatel;y the diet was so<BR>
boring I got really tired of it after a while annd I started eating a<BR>
woider variety of foods. also encouraged by my drs. and on and off I get<BR>
ill still.<BR>

Sorry if this seems like I say this too often but its been so wonderful
<BR>
for me. Yes, diet has helped tremendously. I leave out fructose, lactose
<BR>
and gluten. I don't wake up in the night any more, bleeding has almost <BR>
stopped, everything is MUCH better for this UC sufferer and I'm <BR>
determined to get well. Taking a healthy large dose of liquid calcium <BR>
seemed to help and I'm trying a dried Aloe Vera capsule that I have high
<BR>
hopes for.<BR>
<BR>
Keep trying, diet is VERY IMPORTANT.<BR>

&quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot;<BR>
The book is about a specific carbohydrate diet.   Basically, you can't eat
<BR>
grains, potatoes, processed sugars and a list of other things.  Beef, chicken,
<BR>
pork, fish, nuts, most veggies and fruits are OK.  I am a very skeptical
<BR>
person about these diets, but after 4 months I can say that my CD symptoms
<BR>
have improved.  I think that it is definately worth a try.  I found the
book <BR>
at the local bookstore in a nearby mall, but someone told me that the book
is <BR>
no longer in print (I dont know for sure).  Anyway, if you want to try to
<BR>
order the book, the ISBN number is  0-9692768-1-8.<BR>

My husband was on it for 6 months and it didn't work for him. It did seem<BR>
to at first, but then when he wound up in the hospital for the worst<BR>
flare up ever, we figured it wasnt for him. Good luck, maybe it will work<BR>
for you. <BR>
<BR>
Just cuz it didn't work for us, doesnt mean it wont work. We did stick<BR>
to it religiously, but to no avail. Not on it now.<BR>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>
[Here is my experience with Crohn's and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet]<BR>
<BR>
Originally, I was diagnosed in September 1986 when emergency surgery revealed
what two years of tests (and incredible pain, mental stress and weight loss)
did not:  a mass of Crohn's tissue.  At that time, they removed the diseased
sections and gave me a temporary ileostomy.  In December 1986, my intestine
was reconnected.  I was without symptoms for almost a full year.  During
that time, I was active in several community activities, worked full time
as a postal carrier (walking an eleven mile route carrying a thirty pound
mail sack), and generally enjoyed life without illness or even thinking
about illness.<BR>
<BR>
In July 1987, symptoms began again.  By October, I was forced to quit my
physical job and in December began a desk job.  By February, my symptoms
were bad enough to put me in the hospital for a week being fed an elemental
diet via NG tube.  At least, this time, they knew what was wrong and didn't
waste their time telling me I was anorexic or just a &quot;nervous type&quot;.
 I felt better almost immediately from the elemental diet treatment.  I
got pregnant within a month of it.  Pregnancy put me in what I considered
remission -- no pain, only diarrhea.  I became pregnant a second time before
symptoms returned.  After my second pregnancy, I began to have problems
when my son was about a year old.  But, I could cope with it . . . I tried
experimenting with different foods and had some success with a low fat diet
and avoiding popcorn, nuts and beans . . . not completely but I could &quot;live
with it&quot;.  I became pregnant again and symptoms slowed again.  After
my youngest baby was a year old, I began a downward spiral tha<BR>
as faster and harder than ever before.  I was having severe flare ups once
a week, which lasted about twenty four hours and from which it took me another
twenty four hours to &quot;recover.&quot;   Also, I had begun finding blood
in my stool, something new and scary to deal with!   I couldn't seem to
find anything &quot;safe&quot; to eat -- EVERYTHING seemed to cause problems.<BR>
<BR>
So, that was about a year ago, and for the past six months, I've been waiting
to see a specialist to see how bad my Crohn's had become.  I had never been
on any medication for Crohn's.  I haven't even SEEN a gastroenterologist
since my elemental diet treatment in Feb 1988!  While I was getting worse
and worse and I was still waiting for my appointment,  I got online.  In
September 1995, I saw someone say that they were CURED of Crohn's by going
on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  Needless to say, my interest was aroused!!
 I ordered the book they recommended -- &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle:
Intestinal Health Through Diet&quot; by Elaine Gottschall.  <BR>
<BR>
When I got the book and read the diet outlined in it, I thought, &quot;No
way.  Many of the things she says are safe to eat have caused me problems
in the past.&quot;  But, with the encouragement of another person on the
diet, and with nothing to lose  (as I was still waiting to be seen by a
specialist), I committed myself to following the diet strictly for one month
-- that's the recommended length of time to see if the diet will help. 
Within a week, I began to notice definite positive changes . . . my abdomen
felt weird . . . after eating, I realized that  I was waiting for the usual
digestion pains to come, and THEY DIDN'T!  By the end of the month, I was
completely without symptoms.  Since that time, I have cheated a couple times
and paid a four day price of pain and bloating and diarrhea.  Now, I have
been on the diet for over three months, and I am in it for the &quot;long
haul&quot;.  Even though I know that I could cheat and return to the diet
to feel better, it isn't worth it, in my opinion.  And the goal I'm shoot<BR>
 for is to be able to eat as I choose.  <BR>
<BR>
Ms. Gottschall says in her book that after two years on the diet, a Crohn's
Patient can challenge the &quot;illegal&quot; foods one at a time, and if
they give no problems, be able to eat them in moderation once again without
pain.  There are other benefits that I've experienced while being on this
diet besides a lessening of the Crohn's symptoms.  Since no lactose is allowed,
my sinuses have completely cleared -- I had always thought that I was a
very allergic person and THAT'S why my nose kept dripping!  And, the strength
and stamina I have now are comparable to the year immediately following
my surgery in 1986.  I no longer have to rest after shopping for groceries
so that I can bring them in from the car.  I can DO so many things now that
before were UNTHINKABLE.  I'm HEALTHY!  It is truly an incredible feeling!!<BR>
<BR>
I'm still waiting to see the specialist (my appointment is next month!)
but within the last month, my family doctor has prescribed me azulfidine
to help keep me in remission.  While I don't think it's necessary, I'm taking
them as a compromise -- he talked to a Gastroenterologist about my symptoms
from four months ago and together they felt I should go on steroids -- without
even examining me!  The Azulfidine is much safer, in my opinion . . . and
I'm on a &quot;maintenance dose&quot;.  As many people have already learned,
most doctors don't believe that diet and Crohn's have much to do with each
other!<BR>
<BR>
BTW, I don't get any money from this book or diet . . . in fact, I'm spending
ALOT of money online telling everyone about it!!  (Too much!!)  I just can't
believe that more people don't know about this diet!  I wrote to the CCFA
 (Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America) asking them if they have reviewed
the diet at all.  Their reply was that while they are aware of the diet,
they have not studied it.  Oh well. <BR>
<BR>
The book probably can be found at the library.  (If not, any library or
bookstore can order it with the ISBN#)  That way, you could try it for a
month without spending any money, if you want.   The basic premise of the
diet is to avoid all lactose, all refined sugar and all grains.  It is tough,
but the book is helpful because it gives alternative recipes.  <BR>
<BR>
I am interested in hearing from other people that have tried the diet .
. . with both good and bad results.  I have been compiling testimonials
on the diet to share with others.  If anyone has any questions about the
diet, or my experience, or would like to share their experience . . . feel
free to write me at 100760.1110@compuserve.com (Deborah A. Dowd).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for &quot;listening&quot; . . . and I hope your search for health
is a rewarding one!<BR>

Take care,<BR>

If you've tried the Gottschall diet from her book BREAKING THE VICIOUS <BR>
CYCLE, I'd love to hear from you. I've been on this diet for Crohn's <BR>
disease and IBS, and I have found that it makes a significant difference
<BR>
in some of my symptoms. It doesn't work for everyone, but the diet is a
<BR>
reasonable one and is not dangerous as it is quite balanced. You need to
<BR>
give it a good 3 week try to see if it helps but it really has helped <BR>
with my cramping, spasms and frequency of &quot;D&quot;...when I stick to
it!<BR>

Hi all: I have not only been on this diet and had great results, but I <BR>
have been in contact with Elaine Gottschall many times via phone and <BR>
FAX. She is open to answering any questions you might have by phone or <BR>

see a copy of it, look to the web page where excerpts from back issues <BR>
of IBDetails are made available.<BR>
<BR>
  Here are some helpful hints I've learned along the way. Instead of the
<BR>
dry curd cottage cheese, use FARMER'S CHEESE readily available in <BR>
stores. Also, ground blanched almonds for the almond flour for breads, <BR>
muffins and cookies in a food processor. Works great. If her version is
<BR>
too labor intensive for you (it was for me!) just make yogurt in a <BR>
regular yogurt maker but cook it for 24 hours, not as recommended on the
<BR>
package.<BR>
<BR>
 Hope this helps some of you. -C.S.<BR>

I have been on the Gottschall diet for more than 7 months.  All my symptoms
<BR>
have disappeared except the gas.   Only after 3 - 4 months you will see
this diet <BR>
working.<BR>
While your husband's diarrehea is active you might want to stay away from
<BR>
nuts, raw fruits and veggies and lot of honey.  You have to stick to this
diet <BR>
for 1.5 -2 years.   <BR>
Here is testimony from the net that this diet works.   GOOD LUCK.<BR>
P.S.  Try the cheese &amp; nut bread recipe, it's not sweet.<BR>

Dear Elaine Gottschall, <BR>
	Thank you again for your reply to my questions.  My daughter had suffered
from stomach discomfort &amp; frequent prolonged bouts of diarrhea for over
4 years.  Each time we went to our doctor we were told it was probably &quot;beaver
fever&quot; &amp; had specimen's collected.  Although the results were always
negative we were given Flagyl for her.  This seemed to help for a while
-- sometimes quite dramatically -- but the pain &amp; diarrhea always returned.
 Last year I changed Drs. &amp; was sent to Vancouver Children's Hospital.
 T. had Enteroscopy &amp; Colonoscopy &amp; Biopsies taken.  The results
of this showed changes in the duedenal area which were indicative of Ilietis/Crohn's.
 The Drs. there felt it would not then be necessary to use medication &amp;
said no change in diet was necessary -- unless I wanted to try taking her
off milk.  I should note that at the time of her tests she was relatively
well &amp; was having only mild diarrhea.  They wanted to see her again
in 1 year.  I heard about your book from a sister-in-law who has Ul<BR>
ative Colitis.  Unfortunately she only saw the book after her colon was
removed.  Two of my husband's cousins also have Colitis.<BR>
	I started T. on the diet in November and the improvement has been very
noticeable.  She has been free of diarrhea for one month now &amp; had only
had discomfort once which may or may not have been related.<BR>
	I hope this covers any questions you may have about her diagnosis.  Thank
you for your persistence in telling people about the diet.  It really has
made a difference here.<BR>
					Sincerely,<BR>
					V.B.<BR>

	Our son P. was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in April 1993, at the end
of his senior year in high school.  He was put on sulfasalazine, but after
two months showed no improvement in fighting diarrhea, pain, weight loss,
and weakness.  We were then lucky enough to receive information from a friend
about the book &quot;Food and the Gut Reaction&quot; by Elaine Gottschall,
B.A., M.Sc.  The book details a dietary program that has helped many people
in combating Crohn's.  The dietary program is informed in part by Mrs. Gottschall's
research and teaching in Cell Sciences, Anatomy, and Human Biology over
the past two decades.<BR>
<BR>
	P. started the diet in June 1993.  He exhibited improvement in energy within
one week, and within three weeks he had no diarrhea and no pain.  He has
now been off all medication for nine months and is feeling great.<BR>
<BR>
	We noticed in reading &quot;Profiles in Research&quot; that there is no
mention of research on dietary or holistic approaches to managing Crohn's.
 Is CCFA doing or supporting any such research?  In particular, has CCFA
investigated the diet proposed by Mrs. Gottschall?  Her updated book, &quot;Breaking
the Vicious Cycle:  Intestinal Health Through Diet,&quot; has just been
released from the printer and is now available.<BR>
<BR>
	We have contributed to CCFA and our Indiana chapter regularly since our
son's diagnosis, and we applaud all your efforts.  We look forward to hearing
from you.<BR>

Dear Elaine,<BR>
<BR>
Your book has been a tremendous help for my daughter, who 14 months after
starting your diet has stayed symptom free.  It has also help a number of
other person with various digestive problems who I have seen in my practice.<BR>
<BR>
I have recently heard of a French doctor who doing interesting clinical
research (such as finding that certain old-fashioned grains that have not
been genetically manipulated do not cause Crohn's reactions such as sarrasin
and epautre).<BR>
<BR>
I would like to order three copies of your new book &lt;&lt;Breaking the
vicious cycle&gt;&gt; for which I will pay you with a US$ check.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Again thank you for your pioneering work.<BR>
<BR>

[The same person sent me the following eMail ]<BR>
<BR>
Dear Deb,<BR>
<BR>
I have forwarded your E-mail to my daughter who is on CompuServe so that
you may get first hand information from her.  She has been very strict and
very creative on the diet and it has made a great difference.  It was originally
proposed to her by a gastero-enterologist who is very aware of many &quot;alternative&quot;
approaches.<BR>
<BR>
By the way I am not a Dr.  I am a non-PhD psychologist with a certain specialisation
in psychosomatic difficulties.  I have found that Elaine's theoretical concepts
about Crohn and the the diet most helpful.  However Crohn's is a many facetted
illness and not all Crohn's are the same.  My daughter went on the diet
in the second year after her symptoms had started, she had not yet had an
overwhelming classical medical set of treatments and this I believe does
make a difference.  Her brother who has had years of on and off ulcerative
colitis got worse while he was on a three month test of the diet.  I am
not sure if he was as totally strict as his sister, but it looks like the
high cheese protein was not good for him.  He is now on a modified toype
of the diet but with the possiblities of cereals.  I will include a copy
of some of my ideas about the sickness that I wrote a few years back.  I
do now consider the heavy use of antibiotics, frozen foods and ice cold
drinks to favor intestinal breakdown and the <BR>
ning wild of the immunity system.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Crohn's disease is a wicked nawing horror to anyone living with
it.  It is a symptom that attacks at the basic beliefs and knowledge of
modern allopathic medicine which treats it as a digestive problem rather
than as the sign of an immunity problem.  My theory is that the kidney,
spleen and liver can no longer do their job as they are overloaded, so the
gut becomes a highly selective excretion organ instead of an absorption
organ.  This is the wisdom of the body that keeps us alive and somehow functioning.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately medicine in the states and in Europe (Belgium has the highest
per capita rate of Crohn's in the world) cannot treat it this way because
this becomes an attack at the basic belief system (scientific hypothesis,
where organ systems are considered as fonctionally independant to a large
measure).  In Europe the treatment is not any better although the homeopaths
and the accupuntors and the naturopaths are better trained and can keep
people from surgery.<BR>
<BR>
My daughter, who lives in Reston, VA, was incredibly help by a diet (the
Haas Specific Carbohydrate Diet) given to her be a NY nutritionist.  this
diet is bizarre but it eliminates anything that can produce toxins and thus
trigger the immunity system.&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Good luch to you because it is indeed necessary to pass the word to those
who can be helped, especially as one sees how much the orthodox and ignorant
and greed medical system is butchering innocent people's lives.<BR>

<BR>
Dear Mrs. Gottschall,<BR>
	<BR>
	I'm sure you don't remember me, but I started your diet about six months
ago (May 1st 1995 to be exact) and spoke to you several times as I began.
 You had at that time, graciously faxed me a very interesting article regarding
my spondylitis.<BR>
<BR>
	I've had three minor bleeds of short duration in these past 6 months which
in itself has been a minor miracle.  Last Friday I had my yearly colonoscopy
and although I did expect good news as I've been feeling great, I did not
expect the news I received.  According to my gastroenteroligist, aside from
scar tissue (I don't think &quot;scar&quot; was the term he used, but that
was the implication), my colon currently looks like that of a healthy 18
year old.  I am, in fact a 49 year old, diagnosed with ulcerative colitis
about 8 years ago with a long history of gastrointestinal problems.<BR>
<BR>
	I had no intention of even trying the diet when I first read it, because
it was so very opposite of the diet my Doctor had put me on and I truly
believed that it would put me in the hospital.  By a stroke of divine intervention
(and I am not a religious person), as I fearfully put your book down, I
received a phone call from a cousin who knew someone with Crohns who had
recently gone on a &quot;gluten&quot; free diet.  I immediately called this
stranger and listened to a tale of what amounted to a miraculous remission.<BR>
<BR>
	Although it was sadly your daughter's illness that inspired you to write
this book, I'm sure it has been a bright light of information and a source
of hope to scores of others who like me, have been seeking relief and knowledge
of this debilating disease.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.<BR>
<BR>

  <BR>
I had an extremely GOOD experience with homeopathic medicine,<BR>
particularly with a certain diet I dicovered in a book called Food and<BR>
the Gut Reaction.  I had been extremely ill with Crohn's for five years<BR>
and was at the end of my rope. I was in constant pain and my hair was<BR>
falling out I was so malnourished.  My mom was visting my grandmother in<BR>
Canada and came across the Food and the Gut Reaction book. Within one<BR>
month my pain was gone.  In another three months, all my symptoms had<BR>
disappeared.  I was on the diet for a year and a half.  I now eat what I<BR>
want and have been Crohn's &quot;free&quot; for about two years.  If this
diet<BR>
helped me, it can help anybody.  I've referred several other people to<BR>
the book and they've all had great results.  The diet is very strict and<BR>
is tough to stick to but it is definately worth it. It forbids grains,<BR>
most dairy products, and sugar.  The author clearly explains the<BR>
scientific basis behind the diet and fully details the diet.  My doctor<BR>
basically said it was bullshit but he can't seem to explain why it was so<BR>
effective for me and for others.  It sure can't hurt to try it.  It's a<BR>
lot less damaging to your body then all those steroids. The name of the<BR>
book is Food and the Gut Reaction by Elaine Gottschall.  It's printed by<BR>
the Kirkton Press in Ontario, Canada.<BR>

Hope for those of you who suffer and are looking for solutions,<BR>
here is a testimony on my son's battle with Crohn's.  This<BR>
testimony was part of a letter I wrote to the author of the book<BR>
entitled &quot;Food and Your Gut Reaction&quot; now reprinted under a new<BR>
title which I believe is &quot;Breaking the Cycle&quot; by Elaine<BR>
Gottschall, Kirkton Press, Kirkton, Ontario, Canada.<BR>
 <BR>
Excerpts from letter to Elaine Gottschall :<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;P. was born on September 6, 1976.  For the first 15 years<BR>
his life has been fairly active and fulfilled.  He is interested<BR>
in nature, science and now aspires for a career in biotechnology. <BR>
He has applied for university next Fall.  Other than hay fever in<BR>
the early summer months, P. has been relatively healthy<BR>
to the Fall of 1991 at which time we noticed a drastic change in<BR>
his eating habits, energy level, motivation and weight.  His<BR>
condition got worse every day and although repeated visits to<BR>
P.'s pediatrician yielded no results we persisted and<BR>
obtained a referral to a specialist in the Spring of 1992.<BR>
 <BR>
In May 1992, P. was officially diagnosed with Crohn's<BR>
disease and was referred to the care of a relatively new gastro-<BR>
enterologist at the Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario.  As<BR>
his condition deteriorated, P. was given medication such as<BR>
Mesasal, Asacol, Prednisone to relieve the inflammation but<BR>
unfortunately these drugs generated other side effects.  No<BR>
recommendations were made relative to his diet and in fact<BR>
P. was recommended to stay away from high fiber type foods<BR>
such as broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, nuts, etc...  At this<BR>
point in time, we took an interest in the disease and talked to a<BR>
number of people on the subject and read as many articles as we<BR>
could get our hands on.  All were very pessimistic, recommending<BR>
to learn to accept that this disease is for life and that there<BR>
is no known cure other than drugs and the occasional surgery to<BR>
relieve the inflammation.  The future did not look promising for<BR>
P. and needless to say we were all very discouraged.<BR>
 <BR>
P.'s condition continued to deteriorate through the Fall of<BR>
1992.  In December 1992 P.'s new gastro-enterologist,<BR>
informed us that P.'s condition was critical, that his body<BR>
was not responding to the drugs and that upon our return from our<BR>
Christmas holidays, we would have to seriously consider one of<BR>
two options for P.:  adopting an elemental diet regime or<BR>
surgery.  Obviously we were all shocked and distraught by these<BR>
news.<BR>
 <BR>
It was at this time that my sister-in-law who has a keen interest<BR>
in preventive medicine, had been doing some research on Crohn's<BR>
disease since she learned of P.'s condition.  She discovered<BR>
a number of articles and publications including the book  Food<BR>
and the Gut Reaction  which she believed advocated a diet worth<BR>
considering.  We had nothing to lose by trying.  P.'s<BR>
condition was at its worse.  The testimonies in the book gave us<BR>
some motivation and hope of a potential recovery for P.'s<BR>
suffering.<BR>
 <BR>
P., my wife and I all read the book.  Although we were very<BR>
careful in following the recommendations in the book, P.<BR>
still suffered a few episodes of intestinal pain over the next<BR>
three weeks.  But our patience and persistence paid off, as very<BR>
quickly P.'s pain started to dissipate and his condition<BR>
started to improve dramatically over the next few weeks.<BR>
 <BR>
Our son has now been on the diet for the past two years and we<BR>
are happy to report that his gastro-enterologist confirmed that<BR>
there is no sign of  the disease in his system. He has since<BR>
gained weight, grown approximately six inches, is extremely<BR>
active, plays hours of tennis at a time, plays hockey, cycles,<BR>
goes to school and holds down a part time job.<BR>
 <BR>
As noted we would now like to share our experience with others<BR>
and I am presently trying to establish links with newsgroups on<BR>
the Internet.  We have also actively promoted your book and the<BR>
diet through friends, relatives and co-workers over the past two<BR>
years.  There always seems to be someone in everybody's life who<BR>
is afflicted with this problem.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
We hope that this information will prove useful to some of you. <BR>

Dear Elaine, 					May 15, 1995<BR>
<BR>
	Thank you for your letter of April 27 in response to mine of April 17,
1995.<BR>
	This past Saturday I purchased your new book &quot;Breaking the Vicious
Cycle&quot; from Barnes and Noble in Massapequa, Long Island, New York --
which the clerks in the store told me was in great demand.<BR>
	I gave this to my daughter who has had intestinal trouble for ten years.
 Prior to giving her this new book, I have her a copy of your &quot;Food
and the Gut Reaction&quot; which, after following your advice for just one
week, she felt a hundred percent better and her problem had ceased.  She
is planning on following your advice for a long time to come to make sure
she stays well.<BR>
	Thank you for this wonderful miracle.<BR>

Hello Ish,<BR>
 <BR>
I am on the diet.  I had crohn's diagnosed about 10 years ago and have had
3<BR>
surgeries since, the most recent 3 years ago.  Most of that time I was in<BR>
varying amounts of pain (sometimes severe) and had diarrhea almost all the<BR>
time.  I've been on prednisone, sulfa, 6-MP, flagyl, and a host of other
meds<BR>
at one time or another.<BR>
 <BR>
I've been on the diet almost 3 months now.  IMHO, it is going to cure me
of<BR>
this dreaded dis-ease.  At 3 weeks, the diarrhea stopped and has not returned.<BR>
At about 8 weeks the pain started to noticiceably lessen.  Three months
ago I<BR>
was in constant pain.  Today, pain is the exception.  While the pain is
not<BR>
gone, it is significantly reduced both in the amount of pain I have and
in the<BR>
percentage of time I have it.  And, it is continuing to improve.  Of course,<BR>
your mileage will vary.<BR>
 <BR>
Elaine is a wonderful woman.  I've talked to her on the phone several times<BR>
asking questions.  She is home in the evening and is happy to discuss any<BR>
specific questions you have.  Officially, I would check with your doctor<BR>
before changing anything in your lifestyle.  However, my experience with
MD's<BR>
is that they are not interested in cures for crohn's.  My GI doctor simply<BR>
stated &quot;there is no scientific evidence that this diet will help.&quot;
 Of course,<BR>
he doesn't even know what the diet is and had no interest in even looking
at<BR>
the book I had brought.  But, he is right.  There is no &quot;scientific&quot;
evidence<BR>
this will work.  But then, I don't particularly care about scientific<BR>
evidence--my interest is much more selfish.  I simply want something that
will<BR>
cure me of crohn's and this will do it!<BR>
 <BR>
By all means, stay on the meds your doctor has prescribed.  As the diet
begins<BR>
to cure you, work with your doctor to reduce and eliminate them.  I've also<BR>
discussed this diet with several nutritionists and they also don't seem<BR>
interested.  Although there are exceptions.  There is at least one doctor
in<BR>
New York that will support you in this effort.  There might be others.<BR>
 <BR>
I am currently involved in an IBD support group that is corresponding via
CIS<BR>
E-MAIL. There are about a dozen people in the group and 4 or 5 are currently<BR>
on the diet.  You are welcome to join us--just let me know.<BR>
 <BR>
Do yourself a favor--decide to try the diet for 30 days.  After that, you
can<BR>
re-evaluate your options and decide for yourself.  Personally, I will remember<BR>
this year and this diet as the time when I found the cure.  Maybe the doctors<BR>
don't believe it and of course there are other skeptics, but that's their<BR>
problem not mine.  For most people, it becomes a journey from which you
will<BR>
never return.<BR>
 <BR>
Let us know what you decide.<BR>

Hello Ish,<BR>
 <BR>
 &gt;&gt; My only concern right now is will I lose any weight after starting
on<BR>
 &gt;&gt; this diet?<BR>
 <BR>
Actually, I did.  However, I needed to.  I am 5'8&quot; and started at about
195<BR>
lbs.  I started losing several pounds a week, to the point I called and
asked<BR>
Elaine about it.  She has observed that people with cronic diarrea are very<BR>
often overweight.  She has also observed that with her diet people who are<BR>
overweight tend to lose and people who are underweight tend to gain.  My
<BR>
weight has settled in at 175 lbs. which is closer to what I should weigh.
 It<BR>
has been stable for about the last month.<BR>
 <BR>
I'm not sure if this was a result of the diet, the weight loss, or both,
but<BR>
my pulse and BP are both down about 25% also.  Consistently my resting pulse<BR>
is now about 65 and my blood pressure is about 95/60.<BR>
 <BR>
I do talk to Elaine regularly, the last time being earlier this week. She<BR>
doesn't have any modifications to her diet or suggestions, but she has written<BR>
up update to her book.  It contains a couple of extra chapters and has some<BR>
additional recipies.  It is titled &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot;
and is ISBN #<BR>
0-9692768-1-8.  Although I don't have the book, I understand it can be<BR>
purchased through Walden Books, B. Dalton Books,  Borders Books, &amp; Barnes
&amp;<BR>
Noble.     Regards, Kevin<BR>

Hello Ish,<BR>
 <BR>
I assume you have the book.  The phone number listed in the back as the<BR>
address of the publisher is actually Elaine's home number.  I'd suggest<BR>
calling her and discussing the specifics with here.  She is home in the<BR>
evening and I'm sure would love to talk to you.  I've called her several<BR>
times.  Be aware she talks very fast.  Get ready to write quickly or perhaps<BR>
even record the conversation. She will give you a wealth of info in a very<BR>
short period of time.<BR>
 <BR>
As I understand it, a relapse is normal.  I had a significant relapse at
about<BR>
3 months that lasted about 2 weeks.  Are you using the diet very strictly?
 I<BR>
understand that even a little bit of cheating can potentially cause trouble.<BR>
Strictly speaking, NOTHING processed can be had.  *ONLY* those things<BR>
specifically mentioned in the book should be consumed.  It can be tough.<BR>
Nothing out of a can or jar.  Nothing made in a factory.  It is also important<BR>
 <BR>
to eat a variety of foods and pay close attention to the spiritual and<BR>
emotional aspects of your life.  I know this may sound silly, but after
10<BR>
years of searching this is the one that is going to cure me of this dis-ease.<BR>
 <BR>
IMHO, I would continue.  I continue to do very well with no crohn's symptoms.<BR>
Also, I recommend that you discuss the situation and the diet with your<BR>
personal physician.  Unfortunately, he will probably dismiss the diet without<BR>
a second thought.  I spent many years in self-diagnosis and I know how tough<BR>
it is.  On the other hand, I think I did a much better job with my body
than<BR>
my MD was capable of.<BR>
 <BR>
Keep me posted.  Let me know how I can help.  If you would like to talk,
I can<BR>

EMAIL my phone number too.<BR>

	I am writing to thank you for writing the book Breaking the Vicious Cycle

3 years of problems, it is a huge relief to find some help.  Until I read

Dear Mrs. Gottschall,<BR>
<BR>
This is a &quot;fan&quot; letter to you about the Food and the Gut Reaction
book.<BR>
<BR>
My 20 year old daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in December of
last year.  We were fortunate in the sense that it only took two months
to diagnose.<BR>
<BR>
She was put on a series of different medications, prednisone being the main
one.  As long as she was on that she ate everything and was fine.  As the
prednisone was cut back, however, her symptoms returned.<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure you've heard all this before.  Anyway, in April of this year she
decided to try your Specific Carbohydrate diet.  She has been fanatical
about it since April 27 and has no pain and is doing very well.<BR>
<BR>
The doctors remain sceptical.  She is also taking Imuran and her specialist
thinks that is doing it.  He did tell her to stay on the diet, but it probably
wasn't making that much difference.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to talk to someone who has been on the diet for a number of
years and has introduced some of the carbohydrates that are not allowed
back into their lives.  How can I do that?  I wrote a letter to the Toronto
Star to ask for input, but the letter was never published.<BR>
<BR>
I wonder if you get many letters like this and is there any new development
as far as this diet is concerned?  We are having a great time experimenting
with the recipes and finding new things that she can eat.  A support group
for sharing ideas would really be helpful.  The Crohn's Foundation does
not recognize this diet as beneficial.  Is there more support in the London
area?<BR>
<BR>
God bless you and the work you have done,  I just wish more people would
try this diet approach.  <BR>
<BR>
				Yours truly,<BR>
<BR>
				J.Y.<BR>

Dear Elaine,<BR>
	I hope that it's alright for me to call you Elaine as I feel I know you
-- perhaps because we have a common aim in life -- to help our children
&amp; I suppose, others' children who have the same disease.<BR>
	Thank you for sending me a copy of your book even though I did not send
enough money!  It's easy to see that you're not interested in money -- you're
more interested in helping others!<BR>
	Patrick has been trying out some of the recipes &amp; the cramps in his
stomach have gone.  Over the weekend he only went to the toilet twice &amp;
he says he can 'pass wind' now without anything happening!!!<BR>
	He has been studying the book well &amp; his wife, Y., has been doing a
bit of cooking.  <BR>
His whole attitude to life has changed -- instead of saying, 'I'm 28 years
old &amp; I'm finished!',  He's now smiling more &amp; doesn't bite your
nose off when asked a question!<BR>
	I'm enclosing 10 dollars to recompense you for your bother &amp; I hope
to keep in touch with you to give a progress report every so often!<BR>
	I also know that I can apply to you when I need advice.<BR>
	I really have been praying that my son could be made well &amp; I think
the Lord is answering my prayers -- He always does, you know!<BR>

Dear Ms. Gottschall,<BR>
I was sick with diagnosed ulcerative colitis for more than seven years.
 For over five years, I suffered from severe pains, cramps, chronic diarrhea
and severe bleeding.  I was treated by a medical doctor for over four years
and hospitalized for a period of time with no relief of my problem.<BR>
<BR>
Soon after my son saw your interview on the Dini Petty Show, I ordered your
book and started your (specific carbohydrate) diet on March 1, 1991.  Within
six months I was feeling much better.  There was no more sign of bleeding,
less gas and relief of severe stomach and bowel pain.<BR>
A year and a half later, I am continuing the diet and feeling much better.<BR>
<BR>
I have recommended your book to others I know with this problem.  I wish
I could let more people know how helpful this book has been in getting me
back to health and living a full life.<BR>
I would be interested in forming or joining a support group in my area for
people working to regain health through your diet.<BR>
<BR>
I want to thank you for giving my life back to me.<BR>
<BR>
With many thanks,<BR>

	I would like to thank you for the discussion we had this evening.<BR>
	I am a 67 year old male and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in the spring
of 1994.  I was fortunate enough to see the Getting Healthy TV program in
the fall of 1994 and purchased your book as soon as I could locate a copy.
 I started on the diet October 18, 1994 and at this time, I am completely
free of any symptoms.  I thought at first that it would be difficult to
stay on the diet when we went out to eat, but I have always been able to
either find things on the menu or the restaurant would accomodate me by,
for example, switching potatoes or rice for more vegetables.<BR>
	I have purchased additional copies of &quot;Breaking The Vicious Cycle&quot;,
which I have sent to someone in the Netherlands and given to my Gastrointerologist.
 The doctor kept making excuses for not reading the book until, I finally
said I wasn't keeping my next appointment until he read the book.  His reaction
after looking at the book was &quot;the diet can't do any harm&quot;.<BR>
	After the original diagnosis the doctor prescribed ASACOL.  I am now down
to 3 400mg tablets a day, which as you stated, the doctor probably believes
has caused the disease to go into remission.<BR>
	Once again, thanks for the helpful comments.<BR>
			Sincerely,<BR>
			G. L. M.<BR>

Check out Gottschall's &quot;Food and the Gut Reaction&quot;.  I have had
Crohn's for seven years, and have been following this now for two months.
 The difference it has made in symptoms are incredible.  She is also not
the only person who claims people with Crohn's develop food intolerances.
 Much research has been done in Cambridge (England) and a particuclar doctor,
Dr. John Hunter, has used diet as a means of controlling Crohn's  disease
for about 15 years with an extremely high success rate for people with Crohn's
in the small intestine.  (It is more difficult to  control the disease if
located in the colon or large intestine.) DO NOT listen to the medical opinion
that Crohn's disease and food are not related. Diet does not work for everyone,
but it sure as hell is easier to try adjusting your eating habits then letting
the disease continue, controlling symptoms with medication and never allowing
the intestines to heal.<BR>

Dear Ms. Gottschall,<BR>
<BR>
	Firstly, please accept my apology for not enclosing the correct amount
of money for your book -- my mind certainly wasn't in the right place, that
is certain.<BR>
<BR>
	I am so pleased to have your book and already have experienced tremendous
relief from the severe cramps due to gas.  I have had diverticulitis for
about seven years and it has become increasingly more frequent and with
more severity.  The Dr's here run tests -- barium Xrays, flexible scope,
etc. &amp; have given me medications of various kinds with specific instructions
to, &quot;be sure to take bran!&quot;  I have walked the floor with such
discomfort, that I hardly could bear it.<BR>
<BR>
	Now!  for the first time I have wonderful release and I am so excited about
it and can hardly wait to go to my Dr. to tell him how great I feel -- and
I am telling all my friends about this great diet that really works miracles!<BR>
<BR>
	Enclosed you will find a cheque for the money owing &amp; I certainly will
be in touch if there are any questions.<BR>
<BR>
			Thank you sincerely,<BR>

Dear Mrs Gottschall,<BR>
<BR>
I would like to order three books of &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot;.
 The unit price is $21.88, and three dollars less for each additional book,
so I am sending you $60.00.<BR>
<BR>
Last August, I wrote to you to order one book and you sent me two (the second
one was the first edition); so I gave this one to a friend and for both
of us, the diet was immediately beneficial.  I am absolutely convinced that
you are right and as a chemist myself, I was amazed by all the scientific
arguments.<BR>
<BR>
I have problems finding &quot;dry curd cottage cheese&quot;; nobody seems
to know what that is in my neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
I wish to make other people discover this remarkable diet.<BR>
<BR>
With all my best regards,<BR>
<BR>
D.P.<BR>

Dear Ms. Gottschall,<BR>
	<BR>
	I have read and reread your wonderful book.  I am now in my third week
of your diet and can't believe the difference in my life.  No pain or discomfort,
less bloating, no nausea and no more &quot;hours&quot; on the &quot;royal
throne.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	I was diagnosed with Crohns in 1968.  Since then I've had two operations
and eight other hospitalizations because of this disease.  Recently, I was
hospitalized again and was told I'd need another operation in the future.
 A 'narrowing' of a portion of my intestines was also discovered.<BR>
<BR>
	**While following this diet, will the 'narrowing' dissappear?  Completely?
 Will this narrowing ever widen -- without surgury?<BR>
	**I can't find dry curd.  I live in Central New Jersey.  I've called eleven
establishments but have had no success.  The dairy managers have never heard
of dry curd.  When told that Beatrice has it in Canada -- they all called
back and said -- No!  Not here in the States!<BR>
<BR>
	I WILL DRIVE INTO NEW YORK for the dry curd.  PLEASE TELL ME WHERE I CAN
GET IT. PLEASE.<BR>
<BR>
	Thank you so much for your terriffic book and for taking the time to answer
my two questions.<BR>
<BR>
	Take care and STAY WELL<BR>

P.S.  I haven't eaten a salad in thirty (30) years. (with oil &amp; vinegar,
of course) IT WAS DELICIOUS!<BR>

Dear Ms. Gottschall:<BR>
<BR>
I wrote to you earlier this year and received a warm letter in return. 
To freshen your memory, I have had Crohn's disease since 1982 and have had
six surgeries.  I have only four feet of each intestine remaining.  Earlier
this year I was placed on a feeding tube and faced the possiblity of a permanent
one.  Instead, I decided to try your diet.  I have been on the Specific
Carbohydrate Diet since September 1, 1994.  I have never felt better in
my life.<BR>
<BR>
My weight is up and stable at last.  I can exercise again, have no pain
and feel, in general, like a new person.  My twin sister is also on the
diet.  I have told everyone who listen about your diet and your book.  I
recently ordered the new edition of your book as well.<BR>
<BR>
I am enclosing a letter I wrote to a columnist regarding a letter she received
from a reader.  I want to tell the 	WHOLE WORLD about the diet.  If I can
show these results . . . then ANYONE can.  The only individuals who do not
support my diet are the gastroenterologists who would rather treat me with
steroids and chemotherapy.  Don't get me wrong, when I need a doctor, I'll
go, but, for now, I am sticking religiously to my diet.<BR>
<BR>
I can't thank you enough.<BR>
<BR>
I have also enclosed several articles from The Saturday Evening Post in
case you missed them.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you again,<BR>

Hi,<BR>
        Just one minor point.  I believe the book says that a person will
show <BR>
significant improvement in the first month, if the diet is going to be <BR>
effective for them.  I'm acquainted with about a dozen people who have been
<BR>
using the diet for various lengths of time, all with positive results. 
Many <BR>
of the group are symptom free.  But how long it takes to get rid of the
<BR>
symptoms is a highly individual thing.  It depends a lot <BR>
     1) on how well you follow the diet (and it can be *tough*), <BR>
     2) how bad/extensive the disease is when you start it - for those who
are <BR>
nearly obstructed, she says it *may* be too late to avoid surgery.<BR>
 <BR>
With all the people I personally know, the diarrhea, inflamation and cramps
<BR>
have stopped somewhere between 3 weeks and four months, and there is usually
a <BR>
*brief* relapse, typically about 3-7 days, somewhere around 4-6 months.<BR>
 <BR>
Whatever you decide Good Luck,<BR>

<BR>
Dear Elaine,<BR>
	This letter is from C. S. of Saskatchewan.  I phoned into the CBC Radio
Show when you were a guest in Regina on October 13, 1995.  You asked if
I would write to you.  I often felt like I should write and thank you for
your book Food and the Gut Reaction.  It was a very big help for me in overcoming
ulcerative colitis but sometimes I feel a little shy about writing letters.
 By the way, I was pleased to win your book in the draw that day.<BR>
<BR>
	I have recommended your book Food and the Gut Reaction to many other people
who heard about my success and phoned me to ask what I did to solve my problem.
 I have heard back from some people saying that they are much improved.
 I am absolutely convinced that if anyone doesn't have a lot of improvement
it's because they haven't followed your suggestions close enough.  It is
very difficult for some people to change their eating habits and stick to
a rigid diet.<BR>
<BR>
	I suppose that I should give you a little history of my own experience.
 In the late 80's I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.  The doctor said
that they rate the seriousness of ulcerative colitis on a scale of 1-5 and
I was a 4.  The pills he gave me did not help.  I'm not sure of the spelling
but I believe thay were Asacal and Sulphasilazine.  I was told by the doctor
(specialist) that I could eat anything but I had serious doubts about that
advice.  I read everything I could get my hands on about my condition. 
One day when I went to see the specialist, I had a whole page of questions
about diet and nutrition.  When I started asking him these questions, he
got very difensive and said that people that wrote those books were illiterate.
 I left his office that day and flushed his pills down the toilet and went
on my own diet.  I had some success.  Then I read your book Food and the
Gut Reaction.  In one week I knew I was getting better.  The second week
I was much better and by the third week I knew<BR>
ere was no turning back.  My only problem was that I was eating a lot of
raw fruit.  In the fall of 1989 I had a setback.  I was really confused.
 The blood showed up again, so my family doctor sent me to a different specialist.
 I was desperate so I agreed to let him put me on steroids.  (By the way,
my own family doctor has been quite supportive of my experimenting with
the diet - he admitted he couldn't help much with diet for colitis but said
if what I was doing was working to keep doing it).  Finally, a good friend
of mine was in a health food store in Calgary and picked up an article that
was written by a Doctor Delmar Gibbons who had colitis himself.  He also
wrote a book called The Self Help Way to Treat Colitis and Other IBS Conditions.
 He said that too much fructose was not good for people with colitis.  As
a result, I cut all fruit out of my diet and in one week I was getting better
again.  I was still on your diet and I went to the specialist and asked
if he would take me off the steroids. !<BR>
 He di<BR>
<BR>
sagreed but helped me ease off them anyways.  The last day I left his office,
he said to me, &quot;You will be back in six months&quot;.  I said that
we'll see.  That was 5 years ago.  By religiously sticking to your diet
and not eating too much raw fruit for about two years, I managed to gain
back the 30lbs that I had lost and began to feel like a new man.<BR>
<BR>
	I guess that this is a good time to mention what is going on in my mind.
 I feel like I am a good example of someone who has not always had the best
advice from the doctors and has gone out and taken some responsibility for
my own health.  It has taken me a few years to educate myself to the point
where I feel like I have some control over my own health.  Maybe I had a
few things going for me to start with.  I have never been a drinker or smoker.
 I don't consider myself religious but I think that I'm a very spiritual
person who was lucky to have had parents who set a pretty good example for
us to follow.  With the experience that I've gone through, I feel that there
is a real need for a place like a Health Center where people can go to get
proper information about diet and nutrition and some guidance to help them
live a healthier life style.  When I am at the grocery store, I cannot help
but notice what people have in their shopping carts.  No wonder we have
an epidemic of people with gastro-intestinal <BR>
blems.  I notice the number of obese people.  Men (with their big stomachs),
women (with their big behinds) and kids overweight and out of shape.  People
are getting sick and going to doctors.  They are not always getting good
information and ending up in hospitals.  It is breaking our Medicare system
and no one seems to be getting at the root of the problem.  By teaching
prevention of illness through proper diet and lifestyle, many such cases
would be avoided.<BR>
<BR>
	Here comes my big plan:  I am hoping to walk the length of Saskatchewan,
from north to south (approx. 800 miles).  I would walk with 3 other 30 year
olds as a team.  No one has ever done this before.  There are no roads for
the first 90 miles so we would have to start in March when the lakes and
rivers are still frozen.  We would have to be accompanied by a snowmobile
train for a few days.  I think the entire trek would take approximately
40 days.  Hopefully we will get enough sponsors to raise enough funds to
start some kind of a health center.  So.  MAYBE.  SOMEDAY.  MAYBE.  The
projected trek would take place in spring of '97 or '98.<BR>
<BR>
Changing the subject a little; I am sending you a gift copy of my own book
on Stackwall Construction, as well as a pamphlet on our Bed and Breakfast
in Costa Rica.  My wife J. and I are half owners of the property.  Our partners
have a business in Vanscoy, so Jackie and I spend four months in Costa Rica
operating the Bed &amp; Breakfast (usually from Dec. 1-April 1).  While
in Saskatchewan, we live on a small farm (160 acres).  My brother farms
our land.  We also have four acres of Saskatoon berries (organically grown)
where J. and I spend a lot of time.<BR>

 <BR>
Thank you for your e-mail. I am always impressed when I see a loved one<BR>
involved in the health of someone with this disease. My husband has been
very<BR>
beneficial to me. I can not tell you how much he has done to keep the mood
up.<BR>
 <BR>
Although the diet itself has granted health to a great many people, a good<BR>
inner sense of self is vital. Keep up the good work.<BR>
 <BR>
Anyway, about the diet, you need to purchase a book, it was written by Elaine<BR>
Gottschall, a woman in Canada. Her four year old daughter was very sick
at one<BR>
time so she took her to a doctor that was recommended to her. He put her
on<BR>
this diet and in a year or two she was well. She has never experienced any<BR>
other symptoms and is now in her forties with a house full of kids! This
diet<BR>
had such a profound affect on her daughter that Elaine has dedicated her
life<BR>
to research and helping others. Another gentleman who is a member of our<BR>
discussion group has been cured for 17 years.<BR>
 <BR>
Although it doesn't work for everyone, there have been so many positive<BR>
results that I feel the need to offer it whenever and wherever I can. There<BR>
is no MAGIC CURE of course. I have been on this diet myself for a month
now,<BR>
along with a couple other members in our discussion group. We support each<BR>
other in this endeavor. So far I have had a good reponse. The cramping and<BR>
flatulance are gone and my BM's are down to 3-4 a day as opposed to 7-9
a day.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
I don't get paid for offering this diet to others, I just know how much<BR>
EVERYONE would like to be well. Most MD's do not recognize this diet as
valid,<BR>
and give a cold reception to the idea that the answers for some can be so<BR>
simple. By the way, after your wife acheives health again she can start
to eat<BR>
some of the other foods again, in moderation. It's nice to know that once
we<BR>
establish wellness we can eat the yummy foods. Although I plan to go very
easy<BR>
of the stuff that has no real food value. I found the diet to be reasonable<BR>
and not bad at all.<BR>
 <BR>
Here's the book info, the name of the book is &quot;Food &amp; The Gut Reaction&quot;,
by<BR>
Elaine Gottschall, Kirkton Press. If you can not find it at your neighborhood<BR>
bookstore have them order it for you from the Baker &amp; Taylor warehouse.<BR>
 <BR>
Please let me know if you or your wife would like to join our Crohn's<BR>
Discussion Group, not eveyone in the group is on the diet, but we all either<BR>
have Crohn's or have loved ones who do.<BR>
Keep in touch!<BR>
 <BR>
The Very Best Of Luck To You,<BR>

<BR>
Dear Elaine						Feb. 7, 1995<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your book &quot;Breaking the
Vicious Cycle&quot;.  The diet outlined in the book has helped me so much.
 I have Crohn's Disease and experienced a lot of pain and constant diarrhea
for 21 years before starting the diet.  After a few weeks on the diet I
noticed a change beginning.  The pain slowly disappeared.  A few months
later the diarrhea began to disappear, and now after 6 months I have normal
bowel movements most of the time and NO pain or cramping whatsoever.  No
medication or surgery has EVER given me this kind of healing!<BR>
<BR>
First the first time I can look forward to the future, a future that does
not include endless doctor visits, texts, and dangerous medications that
did not help.  Before starting the diet I had been on Prednisone for 3 years,
as my adrenal glands shut down.  When I would lower my dose the symptoms
would return.  This cycle went on and on.  The residual diet my doctors
put me on did not help.  As a result of your diet I was able to taper off
the Prednisone without a flare up of symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
My husband, who has been endlessly patient through all of this is enthusiastic
too.  He can see the sparkle in my eye, the color in my cheeks, and the
ready smile on my face, He too, has a new vision of our future, as he has
a healthy wife he never knew before.  Instead of holding my hand through
the days I couldn't get out of bed or hearing my cries from the bathroom,
we are happy to say he and I are planning a hiking vacation this summer!
 Something that I could never do before, as I always needed to be near a
bathroom. <BR>
<BR>
One gentleman I know is also on the diet and now can manage his kids hockey
and baseball games and return to University, while holding down a full time
job!  He now has an opportunity to move on with his life.  His five children
are seeing a happy father they never knew.<BR>
<BR>
Another gentleman, who just started the diet spoke of the possibility of
being able to golf now.  It won't make his handicap any better but he can
play the whole game without worrying about getting to the bathroom in time!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again for writing the book and for your countless consultations,
I owe you a debt of gratitude that I may not be able to repay in full. 
You gave me back my life.  Please let me know if there is anything I can
do for you.<BR>
<BR>
Fondest Regards,<BR>
C.M.<BR>
