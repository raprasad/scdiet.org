where they sell nut flour and dry curd cc. I am going to be in San Francisco<BR>
next week and  seeing how I can't find any in Los Angeles, this is a good<BR>
time to stock up. Can anyone is San Francisco help with a name/address<BR>

This is my first Thanksgiving on the diet and I was just wandering if<BR>
anyone has ever made bread dressing from the bread in the book.  I am<BR>
going to try to make bread dressing this thanksgiving.  I think I am<BR>
going to use the receipe for soft bread that Joan sent on the list Sunday<BR>
Nov. 23.    Also I would like to know if anyone has made the Lemon<BR>
Souffle and if they have is it good?  I am also going to try to make a<BR>
sweet potato casserole using butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes. <BR>
I am going out of town for thanksgiving, but I plan on cooking my own<BR>
stuff.  I just don't trust others.  I will let ya'll know how the<BR>
dressing and casserole turned out.  If it turns out good I will send the<BR>
receipes.   Hope everyone has a great holiday!<BR>

Well, the big thanksgiving dinner is fast approaching.  I just tried the<BR>
mock mashed potatoes using califlower and it was an excellent<BR>
substitute.  It was very easy to make -- so IMO, its just not worth<BR>
breaking the diet just for the mashed potatoes.<BR>
<BR>
I think many of us are in a real difficult situation with the diet and<BR>
this holiday. Personally, I'm worried about pleasing my parents -- I can<BR>
see how unhappy they are at the fact that many foods are off limits to<BR>
me, that somehow this will make the holiday less of a celebration.  You<BR>
would not believe how happy they were that I was able to have roast beef<BR>
and mashed &quot;potatoes&quot; with them Saturday night!<BR>
<BR>
My main consession on the diet is going to be the gravy.  The small<BR>
amount of cornstarch is not going to kill me.  I'm probably going to<BR>
make the cranberry recipe in the book and have some wine.  Hopefully,<BR>
this will appease all present and insure them that I am in fact having a<BR>
wonderful thanksgiving.<BR>
<BR>
How does food become this important in our lives?    How's everyone<BR>
else's plans coming along?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to you all ....<BR>

Well I've been on  the diet for eleven weeks and I've lost<BR>
about twelve LBS more or less. The thing I wonder about most<BR>
is how do I overcome the stamina and endurance that I've lost<BR>
on the diet?  Let me explain, having been an avid cyclist for <BR>
about ten years the one thing I've not been able to do is <BR>
carbo load.  Does anyone have a solution for this problem?  <BR>
Other than that I have been able to cut my medication in half<BR>

I am still having trouble keeping weight on, so I'm not a big help there.<BR>
I found that although at first my energy level dropped off dramatically<BR>
on the diet, after being on it a while, I have felt my energy level<BR>
increase somewhat. I used to be an avid exerciser also, but since I got<BR>
sick, I haven't done much, just because I've felt so badly. I am hoping I<BR>
will eventually get back to my old routine, once I put the lost weight<BR>
back on and things normalize. I find that eating lots of small meals,<BR>
with a lot of protein, seems to keep me going.  Hope this is of some<BR>
help.<BR>

This appears to be a common situation (I will not call it a problem) during<BR>
the early days of the diet.  Everybody responds differently and like our<BR>
experience, looking back we were concerned also.  What you have to realize<BR>
is that these &quot;diseases&quot; often took years to manifest themselves, you, like<BR>
others may have overlooked the early symptoms.  So it will take (for some)<BR>
time to stop the slide downhill and pick up going uphill. Unlike other diets<BR>
the SCD works to alter the unhealthy biochemistry of the GI tract.  This<BR>
takes time as unhealthy bacteria is displaced and the healthy bacteria take<BR>
up residence again.  The diet will work gradually to correct the balance in<BR>
your intestine, all we can say is hang in there, we are sure it will get<BR>
better.  The weight loss will stabalize, you will put on weight and the<BR>
strength and endurance will gradually return.  Be prepared to measure<BR>
progress, perhaps in terms of months rather than days and weeks.  <BR>
<BR>
The diet is not the reason for your loss of weight, it is the effect of what<BR>
is going on in your GI tract.  The diet is rich in appropriate<BR>
carbohydrates, high in protein and swimming in trace minerals.  Stick with<BR>
it, it will pay off.  We found that it took time to get things on track for<BR>
Martine, she was depleted at all levels, it takes time to get things back on<BR>
track especially if you are not absorbing due to mucus build up or a fast<BR>
transition time.  <BR>

<BR>
We have just enjoyed (not Thanksgiving) a Turkey dinner with gravy prepared<BR>
from the stock with onions which was pureed.  The surprising thing was that<BR>
it tasted better than the gravy made with cornstarch/flour/etc.  Also, we<BR>
have a suasage meat recipe that, along with some almond flour was baked and<BR>
had some stock added to it to make a stuffing.  It was delicious!!  - The<BR>
other benefit was that we did not have that &quot;stuffed&quot; feeling afterwards!!<BR>

 We also would recommend that one definitely go with the yogurmet II, it<BR>
makes excellent yougurt and keeps the temp. consistent.  We use plain<BR>
yougurt as a starter, ensuring the starter meets SCD requirments.  It is a<BR>
compact unit and does not need to be fussed with, is easy to clean and<BR>
sterilize.<BR>
   <BR>
We leave ours 48 hours regardless of manufacturers instructions, while this<BR>
may seem excessive to some, it is because Martine has a severe LI and we<BR>
just want to make sure all the lactose is coverted as much as possible.<BR>

&gt;If you are drying meats yourself (perhaps with a good ol' Ronco), there<BR>
&gt;should not be a problem as long as the curing mix you use is free of harsh<BR>
&gt;chemicals and illegal ingredients.  I would, however, be very cautious about<BR>
&gt;packaged 'dried' or 'dehydrated' meats as they often contain nasty things.<BR>
&gt; Anyone else have details?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Excellent point. I was in the butcher shop today and they make their own,<BR>
highly touted, jerky and pemmican.<BR>
<BR>
But I looked at the ingredients. Guess what not only was it loaded with<BR>
sugar, but also MSG (monosodium glutamate) a known neurotoxin!<BR>
<BR>
It is best and easy to make your own, I add nothing to it! You could add<BR>
some dried fruits, I do add a tiny bit of salt.<BR>

Hi Mike,<BR>
<BR>
The nut company in SF is Cal. Nut Co. tele. # 415/ 243-0320. Contact<BR>
person: Motzi Dorudian.  About $86 for 25#.  Don't know if they sell it in<BR>
smaller lots or not.<BR>
<BR>
I have never used this nut co.  Use Hughson Nut Co. which is listed in the<BR>
book. Order it at the same price and quantity as Cal Nut. Co.<BR>
<BR>
Re a source for DCCC in the city, I only have an old yellow pages telephone<BR>
directory and neither Whole Foods nor Real Foods is listed in the<BR>
Grocers-Retail section; however, when you get to SF, just look in the<BR>
yellow pages and see if you can find one of these; Whole Foods if you can<BR>
find one, would come nearer to having the DCCC I imagine.  I know there is<BR>
a Real Foods on Sutter Street, going toward downtown away from Van Ness on<BR>
the left; nice store.<BR>
<BR>
That's all the help I am able to give you...sorry couldn't do more for you.<BR>
Good luck!<BR>

DCCC possible source:<BR>
Whole Foods Grocery, 1765 California St. , SF  tele # 415/674-0500<BR>
<BR>
Whole Foods is on the www -     www.wholefoods.com<BR>

Cal Nut Trading Co., tele. #415/ 243-0320.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
$86.00 for 25# lots.<BR>
<BR>
same as Hughson Nut Co., Hughson, Ca., 1825 Verdugo St. - tele.   209-883-0403<BR>
$86.00 for 25# lots. FAX 209-883-2973.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to Whole Foods which is a good possible source for Friendship<BR>
Farmer's Cheese (which I personally prefer...it's wonderful) the following<BR>
whole foods grocery store is another possibility for DCCC:<BR>
<BR>
Real Foods, located on Sutter Street, SF on the left if you're going toward<BR>
downtown SF, and after Van Ness Ave.  Address, tele. no. in telephone book,<BR>
I'm sure, along with possible other sources.<BR>

I do use Cal.Nut Trading Co, and I can tell you this: if you don't know<BR>
S.F, don't try to buy it there. It's not easy to find. He will ship, and so<BR>
will Hughson's. The other place in S.F. for cheese is Country Cheese<BR>
Company on Divisadero St (ph.#-415 621-8130). The product is called baker's<BR>
cheese. Also, there is a Whole Foods in S.F. You can get D.C.C.C. there I<BR>
hear. I buy baker's cheese  at Country Cheese Co. because it's reasonable<BR>
(about $2.00/lb.).<BR>

<BR>
I changed a sweet potato casserole to be SCD friendly.  It is good.  This<BR>
Casserole is like eating dessert.Here it is:<BR>
<BR>
Mock Sweet Potato Casserole<BR>
	2 large butternut squash	     Topping:  3/4 cup chopped<BR>
pecans <BR>
	1 tsp vanilla extract			     1/2 cup honey<BR>
	1/2 cup honey			     2/3 cup almond flour<BR>
	3 large eggs			     1/3 cup butter<BR>
	1/2 cup yogurt sweetened with 1 tbsp honey<BR>
     <BR>
Peel, cut up and boil squash.  Mash, then add vanilla, honey, eggs,<BR>
yougurt, and butter.  Pour into buttered casserole.  Coke at 350 degrees<BR>
for 20 minutes.  While baking, make the topping.<BR>
Topping:  Mix chopped nuts, honey, flour, and butter.  Spread topping on<BR>
baked squash and then bake an additional 10 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
Hope ya'll enjoy it.  I am going to try making dressing with the soft<BR>
bread receipe Joan sent on Sunday.  When I finish I will send the<BR>
receipe.  By the way Joan -- the soft bread is good.  I have been on the<BR>
diet since April 27, 1997 and have not eaten any bread.  I did not like<BR>
the bread in the book.  The soft bread is good. Happy Thanksgiving to<BR>
all.<BR>

couldn't locate that one and I bought a Salton at a local Health Food Store<BR>

I'm going to my parents for dinner on Thanksgiving and I have a similiar<BR>
problem convincing them I'm very happy eating just turkey and vegetables.  I<BR>
will also drink my favorite red wine and make the allowable carrot cake.<BR>
 I've been on so many so-called health diets that my parents think this is<BR>
just another diet fad of mine.  Oh I forgot, I'm also making a fruit salad!<BR>
 If I don't bring some things that I can eat I will surely feel deprived on<BR>
this holiday of food.  Basic human (and animal) needs include food and<BR>
socialization so it makes sense that the two are so frequently combined.  I<BR>
just think in our culture we have somewhat forgotten about the basics and<BR>
have become so busy with other things that too many people have forgotten<BR>
about basic cooking and that could be part of why we have this intestinal<BR>
problem.  Happy Thanksgiving everyone!  Jane<BR>

Dear Partridges and all,<BR>
Hope your Thanksgiving was wonderful. Ours was pretty quiet. My daughter's<BR>
just moved from NY to AZ, so that just left me, my husband &amp; son at our<BR>
table. Quiet but sweet. Lots to be thankful for.<BR>
I think that the group has just been real quiet this week with everyone<BR>
preparing for the holidays, although Allan and Lucy have expressed some<BR>
concerns that the list may be down. Everybody, please just write a quick<BR>
hello to let us know all is well. Kind of like a roll call (anybody else<BR>
here old enough to remember the old &quot;mickey mouse club&quot; which started with<BR>
everybody calling out their names?)<BR>

I'm not doing that well and I'm starting to drive myself crazy eliminating<BR>
different foods. First I thought it was dairy, and although I stopped having<BR>

nut flour receipes (I grind the nuts myself) bothered me.  Well, that doesn't<BR>
leave a lot of food choices!  I'm not cheating at all.  Any ideas?  Thanks,<BR>

<BR>
Hi Stacia,      I don't know if this will help you, but I have found that for<BR>
colds, coughs and sore throats, the first thing I do is start drinking<BR>
Echinacea tincture in water or juice, etc.  A mfg. in my area called Herb<BR>
Pharm produces an alcohol-free tincture and it seems to be fine for my very<BR>
sensitive gut.  15-20 drops in a glass of liquid 2-3 times a day helps a<BR>
great deal to either stop a cold once it first starts, or speeds up the time<BR>
it takes to run its course.  For coughs and sore throat, I make lots of hot<BR>
&quot;tea&quot; of honey and fresh-squeezed lemon or lime juice.  I even keep a glass<BR>
or pot of it next to my bed at night. It's very soothing and helps my cough<BR>
settle down so I can sleep.  I don't have any suggestions for flu meds, tho.<BR>
 Keeping a fever down with cool sponge baths is abt all I can offer.  Anybody<BR>
else ?????.          good luck,  liz<BR>

Hi Pat,        I have followed your mssges re: amalgams with great interest.<BR>
 In response to your listing of all the things you did in the process of<BR>
getting the mercury out of your system, I guess I wonder if you'd be willing<BR>
to cite in yet another e-mail, those symptoms you had that you believe were<BR>
caused or made worse by the mercury and, over time and with treatment, how<BR>
you would rate those symptoms now.  It would really help me, and maybe<BR>
others, to understand whether someone who's &quot;been there&quot; can ascribe changes,<BR>
reductions, etc. in symptoms to the removal of fillings and follow-up detox<BR>
specifically for mercury.<BR>
Thanks a huge bunch for the referrals to the two books on this.          Liz<BR>

Denise here, checking in.  Hello everybody.  Hope your Thanksgivings<BR>
were nourishing and tasty!  Mine was really good.  I baked a turkey and<BR>
made the pureed cauliflower (mashed potato substitute) recipe from the<BR>
book, baking it in the oven with cheddar cheese on it.  I also made the<BR>
nut torte.  I can't eat honey so I bought carrot juice and boiled it<BR>
down to a syrup to replace the honey in the tort recipe.  I made an<BR>
icing out of carrot juice (boiled down) and butter.  That cake was<BR>
great!  I just wish it didn't take so long to make (boiling the carrot<BR>
juice down is time consuming).  I'm not sure how many people out there<BR>
can't tolerate honey, but just so you know, carrot juice is a viable<BR>
sweetner if you reduce it by boiling.<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, I didn't feel deprived.  It's just a little awkward, not eating<BR>
my relative's food.  But, after nine months on the diet, I'm getting<BR>
used to telling people about the diet. I think people like my carrot nut<BR>
tort better than the regular pumpkin pie that was served!<BR>
<BR>
Take care everybody!<BR>

Dear Prateeksha &amp; hopefully everyone else,<BR>
There is obviously a problem with the list server. I called the company<BR>
saturday and was told that there didn't seem to be anything wrong &amp; that<BR>
mail was just light. I sent out a letter to all of you asking that you let<BR>
me know if you were getting my message. It came back within a few minutes<BR>
just like anything I'd previously sent to the group. Tonight I get several<BR>
notes from you all asking if we are still on. I don't go in to work till<BR>
tomorrow afternoon, so I should have this all cleared up by the morning.<BR>
Don't worry, we'll be back in business by tomorrow.<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;971203112915_-1440401659@mrin85.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I hope you all had a wonderful holiday, and are getting all the list mail.<BR>
<BR>
I have a question for those of you with Prednisone experience.  This past<BR>
Monday my doctor insisted I go on Prednisone for about 3 weeks, and I was so<BR>
tired with the arthritis pain and all that I did not refuse as I did before.<BR>
 Amazingly, after the 1st and 2nd pill, all the pain went away, and I feel<BR>
human again.  I know that everything is still there, it's just maksed up by<BR>
the drug.<BR>
<BR>
The Doctor also told me that USUALLY after the Prednisone treatment, the<BR>
inflammation and pain tends to remain lower than before treatment.  I am also<BR>
starting to take cat's claw (known to help with arthritis and CD), and a<BR>
formula called Pain Relief for arthritis (with different fish oils).<BR>
<BR>
But anyway, the bottom line is, is this drug as wonderful as it appears to<BR>
be?  Do the good effects really last?  Are there any implications even for<BR>
short term use?  Any side-effects?  I am also taking Azulfidine in low<BR>
dosages to build up tolerance to it as recommended by Elaine (I'm up to 1/2<BR>
pill a day).  I hope all these drugs along with Flagyl will not kill me.  I'm<BR>
only 105 lbs, and am kind of scared to dump all these toxins in it.  But<BR>
given the pain I have been in,  I'm giving in to all these drugs in spite of<BR>
how I feel about them.<BR>
<BR>
Any input?  Thank you in advance,<BR>
<BR>

Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt;Dear All,<BR>
I've received about 6 inquiries this morning asking if the list is down.<BR>
When something goes out to the list it is supposed to go out to everyone.<BR>
Am I the only one getting mail that is addressed to<BR>
&quot;SCD-list@longisland.com&quot;. Please advise ASAP. It is only 7AM here in NY,<BR>
and I won't be able to reach anyone at the listserver til at least 9AM, but<BR>
if anyone gets this message, please let me know.<BR>
Rachel&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Got it.  Also I've been getting the list all along, although there seem to<BR>
have been fewer posts.  I put this down to the holidays.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt;Good morning all,<BR>
I've just spoken to Matt at the company that provides our listserver. He's<BR>
not sure what the problem is and says that they have rebooted the server<BR>
(whatever that means) in the hopes that it was just a flukey thing. All<BR>
those receiving this message please acknowledge so we can know if the<BR>
problem has been fixed.<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
Rachel<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Got this one too.<BR>

Rachel (and anyone else who cares),<BR>
<BR>
I've been getting a steady stream of digests since 11/26, #112-118.<BR>
<BR>
I haven't actually gotten around to reading them, but I got them.<BR>
<BR>
You wanted to know,<BR>

Hi Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
I just got caught up on the SCD mail for the last two weeks<BR>
(busy, busy).<BR>
<BR>
I have received all the messages in *digest* form for the past<BR>
2 weeks with no problems.<BR>
<BR>
The volume has been light, about 1/4 to 1/3 the normal amount.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi guys,<BR>
<BR>
Some of you have answered lindas message to the listserve address <BR>
(SCD-list@longisland.com)  Her original message was for you to reply <BR>
to her at: (linda@invision.net).  I suggest you re-send the reply to <BR>
her again at linda@invision.net so she knows for sure you received <BR>
it.  Somehow I am now getting double messages and all are replies for <BR>
linda. I missed you guys...but not THAT much ;-).<BR>
<BR>
Happy Holidays to the group!<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;486f9db0@cclink.frb.gov&gt;<BR>
<BR>
     Simone, I wish you had posted your dosage,  With our friend <BR>
     prednisone, 'the devil is in the details', I'm afraid.  Anyway, I have <BR>
     been on varying dosages for the past five years ranging from 5mg (now) <BR>
     to 20mg before going on the diet last year.  It is truly a miracle <BR>
     drug, but prolonged usage of doses over 10-15mg can have serious side <BR>
     effects.   Didn't you receive a pharmacist's hand out with your <BR>
     prescription?  Anyway, three weeks should not be a problem.  My <BR>
     experience, however, causes me to disagree with your doctor that <BR>
     inflammation will be less down the road for you having taken <BR>
     prednisone for three weeks now.<BR>

No one is trying to sabotage the list!!!!!!  When someone tried to<BR>
subscribe themselves, they had no clue what was going on and subscribed<BR>
the list to the list.  Therefore, we had a great infinite loop!  And for<BR>
me to  fix the problem, i had to unsubscribe the list from the list,<BR>
therefore pushing the message through.   <BR>
