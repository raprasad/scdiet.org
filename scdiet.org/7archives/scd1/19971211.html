Hi,
I am wondering: Does anyone out there know if chayotes are "ok"? They
always call them squash in the store, but they aren't made like squash
(they have one large edible seed in the middle, and they have a depression
that runs all the way around them, splitting them into two halves.) They
are more or less pear shaped, and grow on vines like squash. We love them
in soup, and would hate to find out that they are not allowable. and while
we're on the subject of allowable foods,...Does anybody know if blackeyed
peas are ok? with New Year's coming up, I'm hoping so.
Thanks,
Steve

After 6 month SCD for my CD, I was not making big progress.
Just my stool was complete differend.
By that time I read the book "Dismantling a myth: the role of fat and
Carbohydrates in our diet "<Roberta.Gelatt@normicro.com> by Dr LUTZ.
He wrote: eat not more than 72 gram carbs a day.
So I still going on with the SCD but also a low-carbohydrate diet ( 72
gr/day ).
Before SCD I was eating +/- 380 gr/day Carbs.
By SCD I was eating +/-200 gr/day Carbs ( most carbs came from 
honey and fruit ).
After 1 month SCD + low-carbs diet, I make little progress.
Now I would like to know, how much carbs a day do you eat ?

Best wishes

Wim, do you mean you ARE making progress with the SCD+ low carbs diet?
I read Lutz's book too and have noticed that I have much better days when I
keep my carbs to a minimum.  It means giving up extra fruit and honey
snacks, but I think it's worth it.

Hi All

My Web site is undergoing some changes.  We now have Master Card and Visa ordering 
online.  It just came on late today.  

My bank requires a security system to guard the credit card info.  My site includes the 
latest version of a highly regarded security system.

This high tech is really something.

The book or tapes can still be mail ordered.

Maybe it's not the reduced carbs that is making you feel better,
but rather the reduced sugars that you find in fruit and honey.

I'm on SCD (not entirely).  I still eat some rice, oats, and buckwheat.
But I eat no honey and very little fruit.  When I increase the
fruit or try honey, my body tells me to stop it.  But I'm in a 
full remission with my current regimen.  I'm not telling anyone
to do as I've done with the 3 grains I eat, but I have found 
fruit and honey to be much more irritating than these 3 types 
of grains.

That's odd.  Fruit and honey don't bother me at all.  I eat a lot of both.
Any grains, however, are a problem.  I guess we're all a little different in
the way our bodies respond to foodstuffs, even with the same maladies.

Message-ID: <349177E6.2C03@pacbell.net><stellar1@pacbell.net><SCD-list@longisland.com>

Wim,

I probaby get around 200 mg of carbs a day, going by the RDA for minimum
levels to not go into ketosis.  If I shoot for at least that, my energy
stays more stable.  If I go too low, relying mostly on protein, I start
feeling weak and shakey.  Someone wrote in awhile back with the
estimated amounts of carbs in the foods we can eat.  I don't have the
e-mail anymore, but it was really helpful.

I have never taken Mesalamine or Prednisone.  I did do a course of a
drug called Yodoxin for a paracite I was found to have.  I have also
taken Chinese herbs used for paracites and bacterial infections. 
However, while these things have helped with some of my symptoms, it is
the diet that has helped me the most and which I follow very
religiously.  If I have accidentally ingested something not on the diet,
I have suffered and experienced minor relapses.  Also when I have a
cold, I get a looser stool.  But the diet is supremely helpful, by my
standards and experience.  However, I realize that some folks do benefit
by the prednisone and others.  Elaine says, be cautious about going off
any drugs you are taking that help you manage your symptoms.  In time,
if the diet helps you, you will be able to go off slowly.

This has definitely happened to me.  For a time I became sensitive to
the almond flour, dairy products and some others.  Now I can eat them
just fine.  I still can't eat honey though.

Thanks to everyone who has added their name to the list of SCD 
participants on the Yogurt24 web site. The URL is: 
http://www.triplesoft.com/yogurt24/partic.html

The list on this web page is a great way for all of us to see:
1. who is on the diet (name, age, location, medical condition)
2. how long they've been on the diet (i.e. under one month, 1-3 months, 
4-6 months, etc.)

The list is also a wonderful resource for anyone who is beginning the 
diet.

In order to keep the list on this web page current, we need your help:

---If you have already added your name to the web page---
please stop by and take a second to fill out the 'update listing' form 
(located at the top of the web page) if your length of time on the diet 
has changed (i.e. 1-3 months, 4-6 months, etc.)

---If you haven't added your name to the web page---
please stop by the web page and complete the 'add your name' form,

Dear Group,
I wasn't go to go into this subject because I am so ambiguous about what's
going on, but I do so at the encouragement of Elaine.
As a lot of you know, I have been symptom free of my UC for well over 2
years on this diet. Six weeks ago (11/1) I gave up smoking. I'd been
wanting to do it for a long time, not so much for health reasons as for
wishing to rid myself of an addiction that seems so despised by the
non-smoking population. Let me add that when I told Elaine that I was
quitting, she told me it might not be such a good idea. She'd seen relapses
caused by this. This past Tues. AM I woke up with mild stomach pains, went
to bathroom, & lo & behold, BLOOD!!!!
My relapse has been swift & intense. My gastro-enteroligist saw me 7:30AM
Wed. He asked what the hell happened. I told him I've been under a lot of
stress & that I gave up smoking 6 weeks ago. He skipped right over the
stress and said "its the stopping smoking that did it". He said he knew
this to be true because he'd seen it often enough. So he put me on Asocol &
said that if that didn't work, we'd try nicotene patches. He adamantly
insisted I not go back to smoking.I wanted my Azulphadine, but he said that
"nobody prescribes that anymore". I took the asocol for just 2 days, which
of course is not enough to see any results, but I just don't like the idea
of them because of the starch & lactose & so I have decided to go right to
the patch (yesterday & today) and see what happens. I feel better than the
beginning of the week, diahrea, but a lot less blood. I'll let you know how
things progress. PLEASE don't barrage me with an onslaught of pro &
anti-smoking mail. I'm just sharing my experience with you. Love to all.

Hi group,

Remember that survey of whether or not you get less/same/more
colds and flus than non-IBD people around you.  In the last
few weeks my wife and child were both (throwing-up) sick.  Her
brother who came for a visit (on business) had to go home
early because of getting sick.  My wife's sister's family
all got sick with the same or just a cold/flu.  Last weekend
my wife had a cold and my toddler had an eye infection.

Why am I writing all this ?  Because I NEVER got anything :)
I found this to be quite amusing since *I* am supposed to be
the one with health problems.

I guess the diet has helped to strengthen my immune system.

Thanks... Dan.

Rachel,

I too, quit smoking (Jan/97) and by Feb/97 I was in a big flare of 
CD.  Dr also said the 'quitting smoking' was the reason I was in 
Emerg.  I was offered the patches and even suggested that now was not 
the time to quit and I should resume.  There was alot of hype and 
panic about this, but I eventually pulled through without patches or 
other CD meds.  It was difficult but successful. Hang in there! I 
have learned that the increased oxygen I am now giving my bod is a 
GOOD thing, while the symptoms of quitting smoking gave me were a BAD 
thing.  Give and take, I guess.

Rachel:

 Hope you are able to get the bleeding under control.

I cant speak on the  results of quitting smoking while on this diet, simply
because I gave it up some 30 years ago, prior my SCD days. However on the
matter of stress, I would like relate this experience  to you.

I have been on the diet near five years now.  Shortly after first time on
the diet in a matter of 4 to 6 months I became symtom free and then in
remission some two years. I began eating limited starch for likely 6 months.
During this time I had no apparent signs of the Ulcerative Colitis
returning, and felt normal. About that time 2 of my very close friends died
a week apart. I had an extremely diffificult time of letting go of them. I
felt just God awful,and couldnt shake the misarable feelings I had.

Two mounths of this mourning and my Colitis returned full blown. I chalked
it up stess.

This is how I dealt with the flare. I found a way to remove the stress. Easy
to say, but a must. Then I  had my doctor prescribe  a 2 week supply of 100
ml rectum enema called +ACI-Betanesol  Ret  Enema+ACI-(Betamethasone Disodium
Phosphate)  one a day.  It turned out I only used this material approx ten
days untill the bleeding stopped.  Before I started using the enemas I
empyed my colon entirely just as if I were to have a colonoscopy for 24 hrs
My reasoning was to rid my colon of all bacteria as near as I could. The
first thing I put into my stomach was a large cup of fresh yoghurt. Then
very slowly tried steamed veggies, and back to the diet full time, with
double doses of yoghurt the first two weeks.

I certainly know how you must feel, but you can recover again, you have done
once and you can do twice, as I h<Jvert63@aol.com>ave. Then after the flare is under control,
you can wean youself off the patch. Do hope this will encourage you do get
right to work recoverying.

Best of luck, and never give up.

William

i am a very big proponent of  smoking for medicinal purposes. i first got uc
when i quit smoking 7 yrs ago, and never had a really comforting remission
until i started again 2yrs ago. the diet (4mos now) has helped extremely but
im afraid to quit smoking and go on the patch because of the calming affects
of just lighting up to ease nervousness. its addiction i know and goes against
my beliefs . i'm stuck between a rock and a hard place

RE: cold & flu
To: SCD-list@longisland.com
From: Genemash@plinet.com

I as a result of being on the diet I personally have been
eating a lot honey on my almond bread with peanut butter
at least 2-3 times a day and oil and vinegar at least once
a day.  The reason I bring this up is that I've read articles
on how unfiltered honey will build up your imune system.  Also
how if you combine honey with vinegar it even works better.  I've
been experiencing the same thing as far a avoiding getting sick
when everyone else in the house hold has.

Good luck Gene

Dear Rachel,
I saved your message because when I first read it I didn't know what to say,
but it bothered me.  I am so sorry that this phenomenon of quitting smoking
and return of UC has come to you.  As a fairly new person I admire your
commitment and intelligent input.  I don't really understand what you mean by
your ambiguous attitude though - is it that you don't think people will
understand why you are quitting?  Or towards the group?  You controlled your
UC so why smoke and give yourself lung cancer?  It bothers me though that you
have to go through this again because of quitting, boy that really doesn't
seem fair.  What's the prognosis?  Do you have any idea how long it will take
to go back to where you were before?  I hope you have a lot of support - you
deserve it.  Take care, Jane

Dear Jane,

Thanks for the kind words. My ambiguity come in deciding whether to open a
discussion on a very hot subject. Most people have very strong opinions on
smoking, pro or con. When I told a dear freind, that I hadn't smoked in a
few weeks, but would consider going back to it if my stomach rebelled, she
replied "Rachel you could live without your colon but not without your
lungs"<prateeksha@infoasis.com><l03110700b0bb9f41d6ee@[206.40.74.37]>. Gee, I wish I could make that choice as easily as she did. As
someone recently and accurately noted, smokers belong to the last
stronghold of acceptable discrimation.
I haven't gone back to smoking. I am wearing the patch and am back on
azulphadine. I think I'm doing a little better, although every time I say
that out loud I'm hit with another bloody attack. My husband urges me to go
back to smoking, but I would certainly try every other option first.
Besides which, I'm not so sure that the relapse would reverse itself,
simply by lighting up.
I have had two yearly colonoscopies since beginning this diet. For those of
you new to the group, I just want to tell you that they were both miracles.
My doctor said that there was a perfectly healthy colon in place of the
diseased one he'd scoped in previous years. The last one I had was at the
end on January. I'm slated for my next one on Feb. 27th. Keep good thought
for me.

SUGGESTION:

Along with the smoking (for awhile), why not induce a slow breathing
meditation to get that calming effect to ease nervousness?  The Yoga
breathing, specifically, the langhana breath, would be perfect.  With
langhana breath, the emphasis is on the exhalation; so you inhale slowly to
a count (depending upon your lung capacity); i.e. 3, 4, 6, etc.
counts...then even more slowly exhale, trying to double the exhalation
count, 6, 8, or 12.  Very relaxing and centering, and stress reducing.

With love and support for a more stress-less life,

Prateeksha

Over the weekend, as I was making my yogurt, I wondered how many SCD'ers
out there were doing the same...in the kitchen making food from the SCD
diet.  So, I will especially during this holiday season, hold everyone who
is on the SCD diet in my heart with lots of support that we'll all have a
wonderful Season whether we are eating fruitcake, pecan pie ala mode, or
yogurt and steamed veggies!!!

Dear Rachel,

I was about to suggest a breathing meditation to you, when I opened
Prateeksha's message suggesting the same thing.  Something has been stirred
up in your system as it tries to readjust to living without nicotine and
breathing meditation for 20 minutes a day can have remarkable success
calming the system down.  Herbert Bensen wrote about some examples in his
book The Relaxation Response and other books after that.  I agree it would
be worth a try.  

Wishing the best for you

Hi all.

I've been on the diet for almost five months now.
However, I'm a bit troubled, since I've been getting
a slight fever every other day for the last month.

I have got a theory about that: Since this diet is
supposed to kill the "bad guys"<jlager@snet.net> in your intestines,
could the fever be a reaction on the toxic waste from
the die-off of bad bacterias?

Has anyone else experienced these fever pitches, or
am I the only one?

Message-ID: <34970C95.521C2E5A@snet.net>

I=92ve been on the SCD diet now for 3 months and have seen some
improvement, certainly enough to warrant me to continue. However, I have
plateued in the last 3 weeks, mostly because I eat certain foods like
nuts, cheese, eggs, raw fruits and vegetables,when I=92m away from home,
and can=92t find more suitable foods, or just because i=92m bored as hell=
 w/
chicken, fish, and cooked veggies.  Based on some of the letters to the
SCD group, which I find tremendouly helpful, I=92ve cut back to a core
diet of fish, chicken, and cooked veggies, and homemade Yogurt.

Here=92s my question.  "The book"<Kebridan@aol.com><b4484ecf.3496eacc@aol.com><Jvert63@aol.com> (p.43) says raw  fruits should not be
inroduced  =93until diarrhea is under control=94......Does that mean if I
have 3 days of formed  stools (slight blood occassionally) no abdominal
pain, that it is under control? What period of time, under what
conditions or criteria constitutes under control? Should I reintroduce
cheese or eggs first? After how long? What about salads and nut flour
products?

I used to long for bagels, pasta, and rice. (3 months ago that
is)....now I long for nut muffins, cashews and raisins, and eggs and
cheese ........

and so I go.......

any suggestions,  O mentors of mine.....?

thanks for your support.i don't know much about yoga but i do know of the
effectiveness of breathing techniques not only for nervousness but also for
oxygen boosts. each time i go to the doctor i use a similar method to
normalize my heart rate to get a propper blood pressure check after rushing in
from off the street. i also find peace from prayerful meditation. i do plan on

Jane,

First off, I am jealous that he got relief in one day!  I have been a
heartburn sufferer and SCD has fixed that but took 75 days.  I still get
bouts of nausea which I find a combination of activated charcoal and a
product call Gastric Soothe from Enzymatic really helps.

I still am unable to use yogurt or cheese in my diet as apparently I am
still allergic to milk so it seems that yogurt is very calming to the GI
but not mine yet.  Still hoping I will get there soon.  Happy to hear he
is doing well and my suggestion helped!

Prior to starting the diet, I took an enormous amount of Rolaids and other
antacids.  It seemed I always had heartburn and kept jars of Rolaids near
my bed, in the car, and at the office.  I even took rolls of them with me
when I went out.

I have been on the diet almost one year and have had heartburn TWICE--and I
can directly attribute that to over eating!  The difference has been
astounding.

NIGHT WAKINGS: We were wondering if anybody has any thoughts on what the
possible cause/reasons might be for "night wakings"<Kebridan@aol.com><a251c4b5.34971eae@aol.com><prateeksha@infoasis.com><l03110701b0bcddf1d5e5@[206.40.74.49]> It will be almost two
years that Martine has been on the SCD - STRICTLY. (She has never cheated)
She is basically is eating chicken, fish, cheese, yougurt, nutbread and
butter along with cooked carrots and squash along with apple sauce.  Yet she
still finds that her nights are when her bowels are more active, resulting
in shorter periods of sleep.  Any thoughts, similar experiences or
suggestions would be appreciated.

BAKERS CHEESE: Does anybody know if bakers cheese is the same as farmers
cheese?  Recently a local store has begun to stock it and  we were wondering
if it is okay for the SCD?


Rachel,

Sorry to hear of you recent relapse but we are confident that as the diet
has helped you in the past it will again.  It just underscores the insidious
nature of IBD and how influences internally (good and bad) can change the
nature of this disease.

Partridges

Pat,
I'm a little skeptical that one day did the trick, even if he sticks to it,
I'm anxious to see how the next couple of days go.  If misery loves company,
than you'll appreciate the fact the I can't handle the dairy either and boy
how allowable dairy would help in so many ways!  But it must be good not to
have heartburn and the bowels must be doing better so I know we're thankful
for scd.  Take care, Jane

Dear Jane,

As I understand, heartburn is a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (and
probably IBD, as well).  So, no wonder the diet is working; probAbly
because he has only one symptom of bowel dysfunction, it could possibly go
faster for him than some of us who have.....

Jvert,

why not start now, rather than "tomorrow"?  This could be a nice nurturing
commitment to help with psychologically getting ready for stopping smoking;
the langhana breath meditation is wonderful at reducing stress in the
body/mind whether you are afflicted with bowel problems; quitting smoking,
or whatever.

Good luck to you and all of us...WE ARE WORTH IT!!!!

Dear Partridges,

Could be the night wakings are being effected by the applesauce, if she
eats it for dinner or as a snack sometime between dinner and bedtime.  Why
not discontinue it for a week, and see what happens.  Also, not to eat
after 6 or 7 p.m. might help.

I think farmers cheese and bakers cheese are the same, just called by
different names in different areas.  Isn't that what Elaine says in the
book?

Tis the season for Night Wakings I guess.  I have been getting them 
as well for over one month.  I know it's trapped gas.  How it became 
trapped and why I don't know.  I just read about the helpful effects 
of peppermint ( tea or oil )  used to break up gas and soothe the GI 
tract.  I want to try this. I bought some Slippery Elm Bark last week 
for alleviation of these night wakings then learned today that the 
Slippery Elm Bark is mainly a polysaccharide ( to answer another 
question from last week ).  So the Bark goes to the back of the herb 
shelf. ;-)

I haven't talked to a professional about how to administer the 
peppermint to be most effective for overnight relief. Anyone else out 
there already using Peppermint that could add more?

Someone once queried about being symptomatic at certain times of the 
year.  I noticed an increase of people stating that symptoms are 
appearing.  My guess is that the visions of sugarplums that dance in 
our heads contain disaccharides.  I am completely 
joking.....symptomatic, but in a very festive mood.  :-)

Dear Partridges

I ate Yoghurt and cheese in the beginning, but as my symptoms improved I
realized that my night wakings from active bowels were due to yoghurt.  I
gave up both cheese and yoghurt and the night wakings stopped.  I'm hopeful
that one day I will go back to both, but for now I prefer a good night's
sleep.  

Best Wishes,

Roberta

That's interesting! Remember that the flavour of youhurt is caused by

Slippery Elm Bark comes from the bark of the tree.  It's very 'slippery'
(musciligenic), soothing and healing for the digestive system/intestines.  Can
be used with peppermint leaf to make tea.  Must buy shredded bark for tea.
One can use marshmellow root tea as well with this combo.

Message-ID: 

Jane,

I too, frequently suffered from heartburn before I went on the diet.  It was
like my whole system felt out of balance.  Since I've been on the diet the
only time I feel even close to having heartburn is when I have skipped a meal.
Which is always a good reminder to EAT!  Yogurt always helps.  Heartburn
symptons along with D and cramping were relieved within two days after being
on the diet.  The diet is a godsend!  P.S. Thanks to all who responded to my
balsamic vinegar question.

Happy Holidays,

I had a terrible case of heartburn before I started the SCD. I was on
300mg of Zantac DAILY. As soon as I started the SCD (fanatically) I ceased
taking all drugs including Zantac and the heartburn did not return. In the
past now almost 3 years I must have had one or two cases of heartburn.
Just as a curiosity, I had IBD for 8 painfull years. The Doc was even
already talking me into surgery. I was "healed"<Jvert63@aol.com><cae741c5.3496edd9@aol.com><Jvert63@aol.com> within two months while in
the SCD.  So far it has been almost 3 years of perfect intestinal health.
(I also take garlic, Cat's Claw, fish oil, folic acid, bromelain+papaya
enzymes, acidophilus suplement, and husk seeds powder). Between the 24th
of December and 4th of January I will for the first time try eating like
anyone else (except sugar) and see the results. I will visit family in
Portugal (home of the best food/wine in the whole world for zillions of
years) and just willing to test out my new bowels. Roy deCarvalho
