I think the group is getting confused between hydrolyzed proteins and<BR>
hydrogenized fat. In the food section of the San Diego Union-Tribune there<BR>
was a brief Q and A article on the subject. Here goes my transcription.<BR>
&quot;Like other proteins, soy protein and casein, which is the major protein<BR>
found in milk, are made up of amino acids. When a protein is hydrolyzed, it<BR>
has been broken apart into fragments of one or more amino acids through the<BR>
use of enzymes or chemicals. The process involves the use of water molecules<BR>
(that's where the &quot;hydro&quot; comes from).<BR>
&quot;We tend to find hydrolyzed proteins in processed foods because many of the<BR>
individual amino acids have an ability to enhance flavors. The vegetable<BR>
broth is also there to add flavor to the product.<BR>
&quot;These ingredients are not unhealthful unless you happen to react negatively<BR>
to monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The breaking apart of the protein liberates<BR>
glutamic acid, an amino acid that is widely distributed in foods.<BR>
&quot;You [the question part of this column] mentioned hydrolyzed fats, but I<BR>
believe you were referring to hydrogenated fats. Hydrogenation is a<BR>
different process, one in whiche hydrogen is forced into formerly<BR>
unsaturated oils to make them more saturated.<BR>
&quot;The hydrogenation process is indeed unhealthful, as it creates aberrant<BR>
compounds, known as trans fatty acids, that are associated with a wide<BR>
variety of ailments, including heart disease and cancer.&quot;<BR>
