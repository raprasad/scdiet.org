All<BR>
<BR>
I have seen some messages lately regarding the book.  The book is available through the <BR>
web site<BR>
<BR>
http://www.fwi.com/cmg/<BR>
<BR>
We try to ship the book within 24 hours.<BR>
<BR>
One writer wrote that shipping and handling was $6.50 from another source.  I charge <BR>
$3.50.  The shipping and handling charge covers the postage, padded envelope, mailing <BR>
label, and the trip to the post office.<BR>
<BR>
The web site is pretty much a break even proposition so I can assure you that the <BR>
postage and handling is not generating big profits.  In fact, all proceeds go back into <BR>
helping to get the word out about the SCD.<BR>

In a message dated 97-10-11 14:22:09 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Does the SCD diet allow plantains?  They're from the banana family, I just<BR>
 haven't seen it mentioned anywhere.  Also, how about almond milk (without<BR>
 forbidden sweetner or homemade kind using honey). And date sugar for<BR>
 cooking/baking? &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
from page 58 &quot;Coconut milk and almond milk may be tried after six months&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I don't see any reference to plantains or date sugar.  On page 48 the book<BR>
says &quot;It is recommended that nothing be eaten other than those foods listed<BR>
in chapter 9&quot;, so I can't claim that Elaine wouldn't have a problem with it,<BR>
but I figured I'd look into it further.  Below is some info on plantains I<BR>
got from an encyclopedia.  In my opinion they wouldn't be a good idea on SCD<BR>
because the fruit is starchier than a banana.  Bananas have to be fully ripe<BR>
to eat them on SCD because in the earlier, less ripe stages they have a lot<BR>
of starch.  Once they are fully ripe, the starch has converted to sugar and<BR>
we can digest them.  It would appear that plantains do not go through this<BR>
same metamorphosis.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Plantain is the common name both for a type of banana and a family of <BR>
annual herbs. The name is most widely applied to a subspecies of the <BR>
banana, Musa paradisiaca, whose large fruit is starchier than ordinary <BR>
bananas and must be cooked before it is eaten. Plantains, eaten boiled <BR>
or fried, or dried and ground into meal or flour, are a staple food in <BR>
tropical countries where bananas may also be grown.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I have no great insights on date sugar.<BR>

Please tell your friend Kerri with CD that she definately has my support.  I<BR>
am new to this listing (only a couple of weeks- that is when I was formally<BR>
diagnosed with CD and started the SCD diet)<BR>
<BR>
I don't know what I would have done without the internet.  That's how I found<BR>
out about the SCD book and diet, and this wonderful support group.  I feel<BR>
like I am not alone and others care and support one another.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps if you have a printer you can print out some of the notes writers<BR>
post in the list for her.  And tell her I, and others I am sure, are wishing<BR>
her well, and will be thinking of her.<BR>

Hi Susan,<BR>
<BR>
So chocolate is your biggest downfall?  I looooooove chocolate but I<BR>
haven't had any since starting the diet 4 mos. ago!  And my pain is<BR>
lessening all the time; my morale is going up, up, up and I have less,<BR>
less, less craving for chocolate.<BR>
<BR>
This diet in order to work, requires 100% commitment.  It took me 2 weeks<BR>
to get myself to that place inside myself where I could commit to giving up<BR>
all grains, starches and sweets, caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, soy<BR>
products, but I've done it and am feeling better than I have in years.<BR>
It's worth it...by a hell of a lot.  See for yourself, and ....keep reading<BR>
the emails and participating...that's what we're here for, to support each<BR>
other.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck choco lady, Prateeksha<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Hi; my name is Susan Taylor and am new to this list.  I wanted to<BR>
&gt;introduce myself.  I was diagnosed with Crohns and colitis in December<BR>
&gt;of 1996.  I have been reading letters from the Web site since about<BR>
&gt;January 1997.  I have tried to stay on the diet with some success.but<BR>
&gt;I have to admit that chocolate is my biggest downfall.  Just yesterday<BR>
&gt;I<BR>
&gt;had this bad abd cramping that lasted for over 5 hours and I wanted to<BR>
&gt;curl up and die.  In my panic I called my doctor who has increased my<BR>
&gt;prednisone to 40mg/day and put me on 6-MP and flagyl.  What do you<BR>
&gt;think.  I am wondering why so much prednisone. Well I guess this is<BR>
&gt;more than enough information for my hello message.<BR>

Hello Simone,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the recipes.  I would love to get a copy of the others as well<BR>
if you're up for it...you could just send them to me direct.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks a bunch, Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hello everyone,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I was looking through all my cookbooks in attempt to find some other recipes<BR>
&gt;for a variation in cooking/baking.  I found some in the FIT FOR LIFE<BR>
&gt;cookbook, and would like to share them with you.  I would like some feedback<BR>
&gt;if they are forbidden in the diet.  I think they would be delicious, although<BR>
&gt;I haven't yet personally made them yet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;FRUINOLA<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2 large apples, peeled and coreed              1/4C coarsly ground almonds<BR>
&gt;1 Tbs currants                                            2 tsp sweetner (<BR>
&gt;the book says maple syrup.  Maybe honey instead?)<BR>
&gt;1/4 C shredded coconut (opt)                     1/2 tsp ground cinnamon<BR>
&gt;1/4 C diced dried figs                                 1/4 c fresh apple<BR>
&gt;juice (or cider according to SCD)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1. Place the apples and currants in food processor and coarsely grind.<BR>
&gt;2. Mix the apple mixture with the rest of the ingredients.  Mix well.<BR>
&gt;  (serves 2)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;CHEWY BREAKFAST PUDDING<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2 large dates<BR>
&gt;1 apple, peeled, and cut into quarters<BR>
&gt;1 large frozen banana<BR>
&gt;3 large dates, diced into chewy bits<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1. Place the first 4 ingredients in blender and puree into thick pudding.<BR>
&gt;2. Pour mixture into bowl and stir in dates.  Eat with spoon.   (serves 2 -3)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;STANDARD FRUIT PIE CRUST<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1/3 C sunflower seeds                    1/3 C dried, unsweetend shredded<BR>
&gt;coconut<BR>
&gt;1/2 C sesame seeds                       1/2 to 1 C raisins (enough to make<BR>
&gt;to mixture gooey)<BR>
&gt;1/3 C almonds or pecans                 1 C soft pitted dates<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1. Grind the seeds, nuts, and coconut to a fine meal in a food processor.<BR>
&gt; Add fruit and process, adding additional raisins, as necessary until the<BR>
&gt;mixture forms into a ball.<BR>
&gt;2. Press mixture into a 9-in. pie plate.  The crust will be nearly 1/4-in.<BR>
&gt;thick.  Refrigerate a couple of hours before using.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Note:  You can substitute any combination of seeds and nuts to equal<BR>
&gt;quantities in recipe<BR>
&gt;           If mixture does not ball up, add a few Tbs. apple juice, of water.<BR>
&gt;Variation:  For a delicious high-energy treat, roll this mixture into<BR>
&gt;walnut-size balls or logs, roll in coconut, and freeze.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;PEACHES AND CREAM PIE<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1 standard fruit pie crust (above)                           1/2 C water<BR>

&gt;1/2 C raw cashew pieces<BR>
&gt;3 Tbs sweetner (book asks for maple syrup)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1. Prepare the crust and set in refrigerator or freezer.<BR>
&gt;2. Sclice peaces in half moons.  In a mixing bowl, combine the peaches with<BR>
&gt;the OJ and set aside.<BR>
&gt;3. Place cashews in blender with sweetner, water, and vanilla.  blend until<BR>
&gt;creamy and smooth.  While tha blender is on LOW, add oil in a thin stream<BR>
&gt;through the opening lid until the mixture thickens but is slightly runny.<BR>
&gt;4. Coat bottom of crust with a thin layer of the cashew mixture.  Add layer<BR>
&gt;of peach slices in flower petal fashion, spread the cashew mix again and<BR>
&gt;continue so until you end with a top layer of peaches.<BR>
&gt;5. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.  (...if you can wait that<BR>
&gt;long)       (serves 8)<BR>
&gt;<BR>

Hi, Jane, welcome to the SCD group.<BR>
<BR>
The yogurt at the health food stores has lactose in it so you are probably<BR>
lactose intolerant (like me) and can't drink smoothies made outside your<BR>
home with anyother kind of yogurt (that has not been fermented for at least<BR>
24 hours).  Read the book ... fast... and it will educate you about the<BR>
diet as well as provide you with recipes, and guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
With regard to your Candida, why don't you call Elaine again...and ask her<BR>
about the diet in relation to your Candida?  For sure, you probably won't<BR>
be able to eat anything with fruit, and perhaps have to give up the<BR>
honey...which is going to limit you on the diet considerably...but that<BR>
still leaves veggies and meat, poultry and fish!<BR>
<BR>
Good luck and do come with your questions...That's what we're here for.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I don't know how to use this listserv as I just signed on a few days ago.<BR>
&gt; I've never done anything like this on the computer before but I have been<BR>
&gt;reading everything on this SCD site like crazy.  I stumbled across it when I<BR>
&gt;was on a celiac site and found it immediately interesting because the celiac<BR>
&gt;diet was not helping me  (I couldn't even handle rice).  None of their<BR>
&gt;alternative grains worked for me.  I called to order the book and actually<BR>
&gt;got Elaine on the phone. She was very helpful and I should get my book this<BR>
&gt;week.  From reading the information off the SCD site I've been following the<BR>
&gt;diet as closely as I can figure out.  It has already helped!  I do have one<BR>
&gt;beginning question though - I hate yoghurt!  What to do? I have cramps if I<BR>
&gt;drink a fruit smoothie with yoghurt from the health food store.  I've also<BR>
&gt;been told I have candida. I was discouraged when one of your writers<BR>
&gt;suggested that someone might have to go off the SCD diet and work on the<BR>
&gt;candida problem first, although I heard in the book Elaine says the SCD diet<BR>
&gt;works well for those with candida.  I think this forum is a good one and I<BR>
&gt;hope I can participate.  Thank-you for listening!   Jane<BR>

Hi Deanna,<BR>
<BR>
I also have UC, but no bleeding; however, when I first started the diet<BR>
(6/15) I could not eat nutflour for about two months!  However, the<BR>
cheesecake made without nut crust, was an everyday staple for me.  I also<BR>
was a vegetarian (for 25 years) and upon starting the diet found I had to<BR>
eat both fish and chicken to maintain my strength.  I had to puree veggies<BR>
at first and could only eat carrots and squash.  Fruit was out, but not<BR>
grape juice, cut by half with water. And mint tea...that was about it for<BR>
about 2 mos.  And I lost 10 pounds!  I have gained it all back since I was<BR>
able to expand my intake of the foods on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Just go very slow and don't get caught up in variety of foods...stick to<BR>
what doesn't cause pain, for now, just concentrate on that...what doesn't<BR>
cause pain...Elaine says the pain is usually the first to go...usually, but<BR>
not always.<BR>
<BR>
You've come to the right place for support...this group has been my &quot;saving<BR>
grace.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Hello Everyone.  I'm new to this diet, and this web sight.  I must say it is<BR>
&gt;a relief to have a place to go when I feel really sorry for myself!  In other<BR>
&gt;words, it's nice to know I'm not alone.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I started the diet 10 days ago, while in the midst of the worse flare up I've<BR>
&gt;had yet (UC/one and one-half years).  I know my doctor is going to suggest<BR>
&gt;another scope when I go back in two weeks, and I was hoping to have positive<BR>
&gt;news for her by then so as to avoid this action.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Therefore, my question is when does the bleeding stop?  Currently, I'm only<BR>
&gt;eating fish and very overcooked vegetables.  (I've been a vegetarian for six<BR>
&gt;years, but have recently incorporated fish into my diet, and last night I<BR>
&gt;even &quot;stooped&quot; to grill a piece of chicken, simply for variety.)  I started<BR>
&gt;with nut flour, only for two days, but thought it wise to discontinue it<BR>
&gt;after reading several posts about the products being hard to digest when you<BR>
&gt;first start the SCD.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I may be expecting too much too soon, but would appreciate any input on this<BR>
&gt;subject.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks.  Deanna<BR>

Hey guys!  Given that we're all diligently reading labels, I thought you<BR>
might be interested in something I came across.  I hadn't realized that the<BR>
FDA actually runs analysis on foods on the market and will force a recall of<BR>
the food if it has undeclared ingredients.  They recognize that undeclared<BR>
ingredients are a health risk to those who could be allergic/sensitive to<BR>
them.  This is the enforcement side of the FDA.  They post the issues they<BR>
uncover to their website.  The current report is at:<BR>
<BR>
http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ENFORCE/ENF00506.html<BR>
<BR>
Below is a sample entry from the report:<BR>
<BR>
PRODUCT   Country Sorghum Cane Molasses.  <BR>
     Recall #F-835-7.<BR>
CODE Uncoded.<BR>
MANUFACTURER   Rachel Syrup Farm, Dekalb, Mississippi.<BR>
RECALLED BY    Kenneth Hawks Produce, Cana, Virginia, by telephone during the<BR>
week of<BR>
               August 24, 1997.  Ongoing recall resulted from sample analysis<BR>
and<BR>
               followup by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture.<BR>

Susan - I'm also new to the list and 2 days ago I got brave enough to type a<BR>
reply and people did get it - got yours!  I don't have your problem, I have<BR>
celiac disease, but the diet is all the same so I'm anxious to see if we<BR>
stick to it and how it works.  Joan if you're reading this I forgot to ask<BR>
you if you had candida and how you knew?  I read recently some M.D. article<BR>
that said if you were diagnosed with candida is was basically a &quot;junk&quot;<BR>
diagnosis and just the &quot;in&quot; thing for our generation.  I think I also forgot<BR>
to say that when I eat the nut muffins I get some bloating, gas, and leaky<BR>
gut. I think I'm going to have to stick to the basics for some time.  How<BR>
about you?  Take care, Jane<BR>

Simone,<BR>
This has come up before, and the answer was yes. At the time, it was in<BR>
reference to plantain chips(which,by the way, are every bit as good as<BR>
potato chips). If you manage to find them without hydrogenated oil, let me<BR>
know. With regard to almond milk, we haven't found any at the health food<BR>
store that was allowable so far. Elaine says in the book that almond milk<BR>
is ok though, and we sometimes make it for aour son. It is very good for<BR>
you and tastes great too, but it is a lot of work. You soak almonds in<BR>
water overnight. The next day, you grind them up in the blender and strain<BR>
the resulting liquid. As always, sweeten with honey if desired. Date sugar<BR>
should be fine as long as it is pure. We eat a lot of dates. They are so<BR>
sweet that it's hard to imagine why they would add sugar to them, but<BR>
sometimes they do.<BR>
<BR>
Steve<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Does the SCD diet allow plantains?  They're from the banana family, I just<BR>
&gt;haven't seen it mentioned anywhere.  Also, how about almond milk (without<BR>
&gt;forbidden sweetner or homemade kind using honey). And date sugar for<BR>
&gt;cooking/baking?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks, Simone<BR>

<BR>
Actually the SCD is more restrictive than is usually necessary for celiac's<BR>
disease.  The SCD is gluten free but also free of a lot of other stuff!  A<BR>
basic gluten free diet would offer you more foods to choose from and a whole<BR>
range of flour substitutes that we cannot use on SCD.  I only mention this in<BR>
case you didn't know.  You should find relief from the SCD, but if you find<BR>
it very limiting or difficult to follow you should look into the gluten free<BR>
diets as a move towards a broader diet that still avoids gluten.  This would<BR>
be better than giving up the diet approach all together if you get frustrated<BR>
with the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
There are many resources for celiacs disease.  If you aren't aware of what's<BR>
out there you might want to send an email to &quot;donwiss @ panix.com&quot;.  Don has<BR>
celiac's disease and is very knowledgeable.  He personally offers a lot of<BR>
resources to celiacs through a listserver than he pays for himself.  He is<BR>
generous with information for those who are seeking insight.  I'm sure he<BR>
wouldn't mind hearing from you.<BR>

I hope you find this helpful.<BR>

Ellen - I was on a celiac diet for over a year without it working.  I could<BR>
not tolerate ANY of the alternative flours - even rice flour.  When you work<BR>
with the celiac &quot;people&quot; their receipes frequently use these flours so I was<BR>
very limited. I talked with Elaine briefly on the phone and she was not the<BR>
least bit surprised I could not handle these flours and said rice flour was<BR>
particularly bad.  Wasn't the SCD developed with celiac in mind?  Even though<BR>
there are different diseases for the &quot;intestines&quot; it does seem like this is a<BR>
weak area of the body for many people.  Wish I could do the celiac diet but<BR>
I'm happy to have found this group.  I wonder if there are any other celiacs<BR>
out there who have this problem?  Jane<BR>

<BR>
I know what you mean.  When I was first on the SCD, I thought that celiac<BR>
cookbooks might have recipies I could use on the SCD.  No such luck.  All the<BR>
recipes called for various gluten free flours that are unallowed on SCD.  I<BR>
felt like they took the easy way out!  (I didn't realize that you had already<BR>
tried the celiac diet when I read your original post.  I thought you were<BR>
newly diagnosed for some reason).<BR>
<BR>
Based on a recent posting, I'm thinking about buying the cookbook &quot;fit for<BR>
life&quot;.  It sounds like it offers some interesting options that are legal on<BR>
the SCD.  My favorite &quot;regular&quot; cookbook that has recipes which are legal on<BR>
SCD is the &quot;Silver Palette Cookbook&quot;.  I've been trying their entree and soup<BR>
recipes primarily.  They cook with all fresh ingredients so a lot of their<BR>
recipes are fine as is.  Their cream soup recipes often call for creme<BR>
fraishe which is regular cream mixed with sour cream and left on the counter<BR>
overnight.  In the future I'll probably try to adapt these recipes to use<BR>
yogurt made with half and half or homemade lactose-free sour cream.  I also<BR>
bought a Jewish cookbook.  Some of the passover dessert recipes call for<BR>
almond flour, and I've been kidding a bachelor friend of mine that he can eat<BR>
at my house during passover because most of the items he must avoid during<BR>
passover aren't allowed on SCD!<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;971012161753_1099877457@emout08.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the diet about a month and a half now.  It's made a huge<BR>
difference in the quality of my life.  I hadn't even realized how disabled I<BR>
was by the pain and bloating until it went away!  (I've never actually made<BR>
it to remission since the onset of my crohns 2.5 years ago).  <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, though, I'm getting a bit concerned.  I've started bleeding and<BR>
that was never one of my symptoms.  I don't have diarreah (I never did have a<BR>
big problem with that).  The bleeding isn't continuous--just every couple of<BR>
days--but when it appears there's quite a bit of it.  It's bright red with a<BR>
few clots.  I've had some minor pain with it--it feels different than the<BR>
crohns pain I've endured for so long.  I'm not bloated and don't feel really<BR>
bad.  It's just kinda concerning.  <BR>
<BR>
Should I be worried?  I keep trying to tell myself that bleeding is a normal<BR>
part of crohns and lots of people experience it.  I don't get the impression<BR>
that it indicates some medical crisis but I don't know.  Should I rush to see<BR>
my doctor?  Is there anything in particular as far as the diet that I should<BR>
try?  I haven't added any new foods lately.  When the bleeding started I was<BR>
overexerting myself--running up and down the stairs at a friend's house<BR>
trying to care for her after surgery (I generally don't do stairs--I live on<BR>
one floor at home).  But it hasn't cleared up since I moved back home and<BR>
stopped racing around.<BR>

<BR>
I have been on SCD for about 14 days and am very pleased with my bodies<BR>
response so far.  However, in &quot;flare-ups&quot; in the past, I discovered that<BR>
I could not tolerate Milk, Yogurt, Cheese etc.  I thought with eating<BR>
Homemade Yogurt as per the book, and eating allowed cheeses that I would<BR>
possibly be able to now eat these.  I have tried yogurt mixed with<BR>
correct dry curd cheese twice and both times felt very tired and weak<BR>
afterwards, and last nite tried about 1.5 oz's of &quot;allowed&quot;  Cheddar<BR>
Cheese.  I got very bloated and nauseous.<BR>
<BR>
Is it likely that I am trying these foods too early?  That I will be<BR>
able to tolerate them later?  Or has anyone found that they simply have<BR>
an &quot;allergy&quot; to milk proteins and can't eat these on SCD at all?  If so,<BR>
this is disappointing as it expands the things I can eat so much.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your input!<BR>

<BR>
Jane,<BR>
<BR>
Over the past 10 years have been diagnosed numerous times as having<BR>
Candida.  The anti-fungal medicines, especially the natural ones like<BR>
capryllic acid and grapefruit seed extract along with drug anti-fungals<BR>
like Nizoril and Diflucan seemed to help me albeit very gradually.  I<BR>
retrospect, however, the recommended Candida Diet was very destructive<BR>
to me and I am now convinced, since discovering SCD, dramatically<BR>
postponed my getting into remmission which usually would take 4 -7<BR>
months and would recur 6-18 months later.  I have kept detailed journals<BR>
for 10 years and going back and reading them now in light of SCD almost<BR>
makes me feel stupid for not seeing the obvious connection between my<BR>
prolonged and varying symptoms directly corresponding to eating complex<BR>
carbohydrates.  It is so obvious to me now. Oh well!  Don't make the<BR>
same mistake.<BR>
<BR>
I have only been on the SCD diet for 14 days after experiencing yet<BR>
another flare up of what I have been taught to think of as Candida.<BR>
After looking at things differently after reading Elaines book,  I am<BR>
now convinced that Candida is but a symptom of a deeper issue that SCD<BR>
addresses.  Already in 14 days I am feeling much, much better and can<BR>
tell I am recovering faster than I have ever recovered on the Candida<BR>
Diet.  I am using the SCD diet with Capryllic Acid and a product called<BR>
Caps Plus.  <BR>
<BR>
My recommendation is that you focus on SCD and if you want to add some<BR>
anti-fungul natural killer substances use these.  The Candida Diet,<BR>
however, is not good if your primary issue is poor digestion of<BR>
carbohydrates as per SCD.  <BR>
<BR>
n addition, with the Candida diet, honey and fruit is ACCURSED,  I found<BR>
myself at first with SCD trying these with &quot;fear and trepidation&quot; but to<BR>
my surprise I had no problem at all.  I found with the Candida Diet, I<BR>
had little energy at all and this is because they don't allow anything<BR>
that your body can easily and readily make energy from. Plus they push<BR>
&quot;complex Carbos&quot; that you can't digest but the Microbes can.  Unless you<BR>
have massive problems with Thrush or esophogeal candida you should have<BR>
no problems with fruit or honey.  <BR>
<BR>
Good Luck and God Bless!<BR>

&gt; when I<BR>
&gt; was on a celiac site and found it immediately interesting because the<BR>
&gt; celiac<BR>
&gt; diet was not helping me  (I couldn't even handle rice).  None of their<BR>
&gt; alternative grains worked for me.  I called to order the book and<BR>
&gt; actually<BR>
&gt; got Elaine on the phone. She was very helpful and I should get my book<BR>
&gt; this<BR>
&gt; week.  From reading the information off the SCD site I've been<BR>
&gt; following the<BR>
&gt; diet as closely as I can figure out.  It has already helped!  I do<BR>
&gt; have one<BR>
&gt; beginning question though - I hate yoghurt!  What to do? I have cramps<BR>
&gt; if I<BR>
&gt; drink a fruit smoothie with yoghurt from the health food store.  I've<BR>
&gt; also<BR>
&gt; been told I have candida. I was discouraged when one of your writers<BR>
&gt; suggested that someone might have to go off the SCD diet and work on<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; candida problem first, although I heard in the book Elaine says the<BR>
&gt; SCD diet<BR>
&gt; works well for those with candida.  I think this forum is a good one<BR>

&gt; hope I can participate.  Thank-you for listening!   Jane<BR>

<BR>
I have just started my 5 year  old autistic son on the diet. Rather than<BR>
suffering from diarrhea per se, he has high counts of both candida and &quot;bad&quot;<BR>
bacteria, (from excessive antibiotics for ear infections). Toxins and<BR>
metabolites from these two things produce neurological symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
Do I need to start as carefully as those with actual bleeding/diarrhea?  He<BR>
used to have diarrhea and of course I listened to the doctors and they did<BR>
not know what to do.<BR>
<BR>
Now, he has been on a celiac diet which helped him a lot, however, I am<BR>
hoping for more improvement on this diet as we get rid of candida and the<BR>
&quot;bad&quot; bacteria which are feeding on undigested carbohydrates.<BR>
<BR>
I would appreciate any suggestions. Yesterday we made the zucchini muffins<BR>
and he loved them, I don't think I ground the nuts quite enough, we are<BR>
getting a shipment from Hughson's by Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
I am holding off on the honey/fruits due to candida. Also, I could use<BR>
breakfast suggestions. <BR>
<BR>
We made the chicken soup in the book and he loved it.<BR>
<BR>
Will food sensitivities go away? With the leaky gut (from antibiotics) the<BR>
proteins from foods such as beef got out into his blood and he has<BR>
antibodies to them. On an ELISA or RAST test, he tested as &quot;allergic&quot; to<BR>
dairy, gluten, beef, peanuts, yeast, and corn.<BR>
<BR>
Do any of these allergies go away? How long does it take for the gut to<BR>
heal, if you stay on the diet?<BR>

Re The SCD and Candida...on page 27 of Elaine's Book, I quote:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When it is suspected that yeast invasion is widespread (the oral<BR>
infection, thrush, would be an indicator) it is wise to cut back on honey<BR>
ingestion at the beginning of the dietary regimen (amount of honey in<BR>
recipes should be decreased by at least 75%.  The amount of honey may be<BR>
increased as the condition improves.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Page 28...Sucrose is a table sugar and...there is a smal amount of sucrose<BR>
(about 1%-3% in some pastueurized honey but it has been shown to be<BR>
tolerated by those on the SCD.  Unpasteurized honey contains virtually no<BR>
sucrose since an enzyme in the honey splits whatever sucrose may be<BR>
present....&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So, seems like unpasteurized honey would be the ideal way for all of us to<BR>
go...and if you have Candida, to start out with minimal amounts.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Over the past 10 years have been diagnosed numerous times as having<BR>
&gt;Candida.  The anti-fungal medicines, especially the natural ones like<BR>
&gt;capryllic acid and grapefruit seed extract along with drug anti-fungals<BR>
&gt;like Nizoril and Diflucan seemed to help me albeit very gradually.  I<BR>
&gt;retrospect, however, the recommended Candida Diet was very destructive<BR>
&gt;to me and I am now convinced, since discovering SCD, dramatically<BR>
&gt;postponed my getting into remmission which usually would take 4 -7<BR>
&gt;months and would recur 6-18 months later.  I have kept detailed journals<BR>
&gt;for 10 years and going back and reading them now in light of SCD almost<BR>
&gt;makes me feel stupid for not seeing the obvious connection between my<BR>
&gt;prolonged and varying symptoms directly corresponding to eating complex<BR>
&gt;carbohydrates.  It is so obvious to me now. Oh well!  Don't make the<BR>
&gt;same mistake.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have only been on the SCD diet for 14 days after experiencing yet<BR>
&gt;another flare up of what I have been taught to think of as Candida.<BR>
&gt;After looking at things differently after reading Elaines book,  I am<BR>
&gt;now convinced that Candida is but a symptom of a deeper issue that SCD<BR>
&gt;addresses.  Already in 14 days I am feeling much, much better and can<BR>
&gt;tell I am recovering faster than I have ever recovered on the Candida<BR>
&gt;Diet.  I am using the SCD diet with Capryllic Acid and a product called<BR>
&gt;Caps Plus.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;My recommendation is that you focus on SCD and if you want to add some<BR>
&gt;anti-fungul natural killer substances use these.  The Candida Diet,<BR>
&gt;however, is not good if your primary issue is poor digestion of<BR>
&gt;carbohydrates as per SCD.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;n addition, with the Candida diet, honey and fruit is ACCURSED,  I found<BR>
&gt;myself at first with SCD trying these with &quot;fear and trepidation&quot; but to<BR>
&gt;my surprise I had no problem at all.  I found with the Candida Diet, I<BR>
&gt;had little energy at all and this is because they don't allow anything<BR>
&gt;that your body can easily and readily make energy from. Plus they push<BR>
&gt;&quot;complex Carbos&quot; that you can't digest but the Microbes can.  Unless you<BR>
&gt;have massive problems with Thrush or esophogeal candida you should have<BR>
&gt;no problems with fruit or honey.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Good Luck and God Bless!<BR>

&gt;&gt; I don't know how to use this listserv as I just signed on a few days<BR>
&gt;&gt; ago.<BR>
&gt;&gt;  I've never done anything like this on the computer before but I have<BR>
&gt;&gt; been<BR>
&gt;&gt; reading everything on this SCD site like crazy.  I stumbled across it<BR>
&gt;&gt; when I<BR>
&gt;&gt; was on a celiac site and found it immediately interesting because the<BR>
&gt;&gt; celiac<BR>
&gt;&gt; diet was not helping me  (I couldn't even handle rice).  None of their<BR>
&gt;&gt; alternative grains worked for me.  I called to order the book and<BR>
&gt;&gt; actually<BR>
&gt;&gt; got Elaine on the phone. She was very helpful and I should get my book<BR>
&gt;&gt; this<BR>
&gt;&gt; week.  From reading the information off the SCD site I've been<BR>
&gt;&gt; following the<BR>
&gt;&gt; diet as closely as I can figure out.  It has already helped!  I do<BR>
&gt;&gt; have one<BR>
&gt;&gt; beginning question though - I hate yoghurt!  What to do? I have cramps<BR>
&gt;&gt; if I<BR>
&gt;&gt; drink a fruit smoothie with yoghurt from the health food store.  I've<BR>
&gt;&gt; also<BR>
&gt;&gt; been told I have candida. I was discouraged when one of your writers<BR>
&gt;&gt; suggested that someone might have to go off the SCD diet and work on<BR>
&gt;&gt; the<BR>
&gt;&gt; candida problem first, although I heard in the book Elaine says the<BR>
&gt;&gt; SCD diet<BR>
&gt;&gt; works well for those with candida.  I think this forum is a good one<BR>
&gt;&gt; and I<BR>
&gt;&gt; hope I can participate.  Thank-you for listening!   Jane<BR>

<BR>
After reading  Steve's and E's response about plantains, I am a bit<BR>
 confused.  <BR>
<BR>
Have you, Steve eaten plantains without aversive reactions?  Also, if you<BR>
want plantain chips, why don't you make them yourself by  frying them?<BR>
 There's a  fried carrots recipe in the book, so I guess plantains get fried<BR>
the same way.  I had fried bananas once (but they were rolled in sugar&amp;<BR>
cinnamon, though...the good old days, huh?)<BR>
<BR>
I am doing so well so far on the diet that I am afraid of trying something<BR>
that may disagree with me.  I often have nighmares that I forgot, and ate<BR>
'forbidden' foods.  I wake up scared and relieved that it was just a<BR>
nightmare.  Imagine having nighmares about eating bagels and cereal...how<BR>
bizzare!!<BR>

I have avoided dairy products for months thinking they're out to get me.<BR>
After my doctor diagnosed my with CD less than a couple of weeks ago, he told<BR>
me no matter what I do, stay away from ALL dairy products.  I told him that I<BR>
am starting the  SCD diet, and allows   home made yougurt and hard cheeses<BR>
w/out lactose.  He did not object to the diet except the  lactose part.  He<BR>
insisted that with many people  with IBD, their system  can not tolerate milk<BR>
protein, not just lactose.  He advised it is best to stay away from them than<BR>
 be sorry.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I didn't listen to him, and have been eating sharp cheddar cheese and<BR>
parmesan.  I can't find anyone who even heard of  dry curd cheese in South<BR>
and Central Florida, let alone find some.  I don't   even know where to begin<BR>
with the yogurt business.  No retailer in the area sells yougurt makers, or<BR>
if one does is like a million dollars.  And I'm afraid to try it on my own.<BR>
 I don't know how fool-proof it is yet.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, so far I have not had any problems with the cheeses, so I may not  be<BR>
milk protein intolerant.  But you may be.  It is possible.  Have you<BR>
 consulted your doctor about it?  I wish you the best with this.<BR>

I'm still new at using this but I wanted to reply to Pat.  Thank-you for<BR>
sharing your candida experience with me.  You gave it much more of a try than<BR>
I did.  I was mixing nystatin powder as an anti-fungal but gave it up when I<BR>
wouldn't stick with the diet.  I too was exhausted and had young children at<BR>
the time.  I'm just starting the SCD diet and you're just ahead of me so<BR>
please stay posted because I can relate to some things you talk about.  I<BR>
hope someone can help you with the reaction to the yogurt and allowable<BR>
cheese.  I also get sick if I eat store bought yogurt or any milk products so<BR>
I don't know if I should invest in a yogurt machine. I've heard that because<BR>
it ferments ( I'm not sure that is the correct term) longer I might be able<BR>
too, although you still have a problem.  Someone else said that they did the<BR>
diet with great success and just left out the yogurt, while others say they<BR>
felt it was a key component in getting well.  May I ask - what intestinal<BR>
disorder do you have?  Thanks again for your info.  Jane<BR>

In the book, Elaine gives resources for dry curd cottage.  Bet they'll ship<BR>
it to you if you can't find it locally.  It is also referred to as Baker's<BR>
Cheese, and  Farmer's Cheese.<BR>
<BR>
Many second hand stores have yogurt makers and also garage sales would be a<BR>
good source if you can't afford the Yogurmet some people are using and<BR>
don't want to make it in the oven, using the oven light and placing a<BR>
thermometer on the rack to check to see when the temp gets to between 100<BR>
and 110 degrees F.<BR>
<BR>
One thing I have learned on this diet, I have to be RESOURCEFUL!!!!!!!<BR>

&gt;All,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The subject of the SCD and the medical establishment and CCFA is of great<BR>
importance.  <BR>
&gt;We have a significant grass roots movement now that needs to grow even<BR>
stronger.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I remember when Elaine came to Fort Wayne, I called in advance to the<BR>
leader of the <BR>
&gt;support group for cystic fibrosis.  I wanted her group to know about the<BR>
Elaine's talk <BR>
&gt;and they could come to one of the presentations if they chose to.  The<BR>
lady told me that <BR>
&gt;she would have to check with the doctors to determine if they would allow<BR>
the group to <BR>
&gt;hear about this information.  I think you can guess the result.  This<BR>
practice is fairly <BR>
&gt;common.  It is a form of censorship but I do not think they realize that<BR>
censorship is <BR>
&gt;taking place.  I think they believe they are protecting their group.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;In the long run, I think we need an organization which has a mission to<BR>
perpetuate the <BR>
&gt;SCD.  That would include making information available, be a clearing house<BR>
for <BR>
&gt;questions/answers and take a proactive role in promoting the SCD.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The CCFA is, in my mind, in the fund raising business.  They are well<BR>
organized and do a <BR>
&gt;good job of raising funds.  If bowel diseases were ever cured, I suspect<BR>
the CCFA would <BR>
&gt;change its name and mission and continue to raise funds for another cause.<BR>
 This has <BR>
&gt;happened in the past - remember polio.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The medical profession, similarly is in the medicine and operation<BR>
business.  The <BR>
&gt;doctors are well trained and they are good at it.  Unfortunately, the best<BR>
answers are <BR>
&gt;not always medicines and operations.  Keep in mind that doctors have been<BR>
trained for <BR>
&gt;many years in school.  They have been thoroughly immersed in the<BR>
medication/operation <BR>
&gt;methods.  To them, anything that deviates from that training is suspect at<BR>
best.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;We will not turn the corner on this overnight.  We are dealing with one of<BR>
the most <BR>
&gt;powerful establishments in the world.<BR>

Hi everybody!<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the scd since mid april. My UC improved first but about 2<BR>
months ago it got really worse. I opted for cortisone the first time<BR>
(hydrocortisone, to be applied rectally) and resumed taking salofalk<BR>
(mezazaline) again. Now my condition is getting better, I have much more<BR>
energy and my stool has normalized except for the mucous. The first bm<BR>
in the morning is formed with only a bit of mucous, but it irritates my<BR>
bowel and I have several successive bm with only bits of stool (no<BR>
diarrhea) and more liquid mucous. It seems to be the irritation of the<BR>
rectum that is bothering me most at the moment, but compared with my<BR>
situation during my relapse it is much better though very annoying.<BR>
Elaine writes that relapses often occur after 2-3 months on the diet and<BR>
then improvement is steady, so I am positive to be on the track of<BR>
recovery now.<BR>
I would appreciate comments on my irritated rectum and mucousy but<BR>
formed stool.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
Miroslav<BR>
Germany<BR>
<BR>
P.S.<BR>
One comment on the posts dealing with medical authorities ignoring a<BR>
dietary approach of treating IBD because of (allegedly) missing<BR>
scientific proof. In his book &quot;Sick stomach, sick bowel ...&quot; Dr. Lutz<BR>
mentions a clinical trial with IBD patients in Germany that showed that<BR>
patients on a low carbohydrate diet (max. 70-80g a day) compared to a<BR>
group treated with drugs showed the most significant improvement. I<BR>
can&yen;t remember details now, but the trial showed that the diet helped<BR>
(after 11/2 - 2 years in some cases) in up to 80 % of the cases. The<BR>
diet group showed the best results.<BR>

I have not skipped any periods while on the SCD but, a long time ago,<BR>
when my weight dipped really low, I did.  I also skipped some periods<BR>
while I was doing a really physically stressful Outward Bound course in<BR>
Maine.  I'm not sure if these apply to you, but if your weight has<BR>
dropped on the SCD, it could effect your period.  How about otherwise? <BR>
Like, if you have a lot of energy, but lose your period for awhile, I<BR>
think that would be different than losing it while you feel lousy.  But<BR>
as far as I know, body fat is the single biggest element in women's<BR>
periods disappearing.<BR>

I don't have any suggestions on how to stop your problem, but I just =<BR>
wanted to say that I have the exact same problem that you do. I found =<BR>
that when I reduce (don't eliminate) the amount of fruit and vegetables =<BR>
that I consume, that my bowel movements become more soiled and stay that =<BR>
way. I also found that I had to eliminate all coffee and ungrounded nuts =<BR>
from my diet. The only fruit juice that my system tolerates is unsweeted =<BR>
pinaple juice. The other juices cause me problems. I eat a lot of =<BR>
cheese, meat, eggs, and broccoli. For some reason broccoli really slows =<BR>
down the pace of bowel movements for me when other vegetables cause me =<BR>
problems when I eat too much them.<BR>
<BR>
I ended up going back on Rowasa (mesalamine) also.<BR>

To all,<BR>
<BR>
All the messages I've seen on this subject lately reminds me of the <BR>
movie, &quot;Lorenzo's Oil.&quot; For those of you that have seen this movie, it <BR>
was great! The medical establishment refused to believe this oil could <BR>
arrest a deadly disease in the nervous system that attacked children <BR>
with a certain recessive gene. Lorenzo was afflicted with this disease <BR>
so his father (not a medical professional (much like Elaine)) <BR>
desperately started looking for a cure to the disease. He finally <BR>
developed an oil that when ingested, totally arrest the disease. He <BR>
tried to get the medical establishment to embrace the use of this oil, <BR>
but met with complete resistance from these supposedly elite medical <BR>
professional who were looking for a cure for the deadly disease.<BR>
<BR>
So, Lorenzo's father started giving this oil to other parents in his <BR>
support group who also had children with the disease. The disease was <BR>
completely arrested in 100% of the children. But still, the medical <BR>
establishment wouldn't remove their blinders because no double blind <BR>
study had been done with the oil. These idiots finally changed their <BR>
minds when all of the parents of these children stood up in unison and <BR>
stated that the disease in their children had been arrested.<BR>
<BR>
It seems that we will have to do the same thing with SCD to get the CCFA <BR>
to remove their blinders. These people are supposed to be dedicated to <BR>
saving lives, but ego and greed ends up consuming them instead. Sadly, <BR>
the victims of the disease (us and many others) are merely pawns in the <BR>
chess game of greed and the disbelief that people with no medical degree <BR>
(Elaine) could actually have solutions to medical problems.<BR>
<BR>
Just my opinion.<BR>

Hi all,<BR>
<BR>
I'm thinking about writing a letter to CCFA asking them why they<BR>
choose to omit information about SCD.  But I first want to ask<BR>
if anyone knows if any formal studies have been done to see<BR>
what percentage of people on SCD are helped.  I have heard that<BR>
up to 75% who try the diet are helped.  But where does this statistic<BR>
come from?  And to what degree are the people helped?  Does everyone<BR>
reach a remission?<BR>

&gt; I've been on the diet about a month and a half now.  It's made a huge<BR>
&gt; difference in the quality of my life.  I hadn't even realized how<BR>
&gt; disabled I<BR>
&gt; was by the pain and bloating until it went away!  (I've never actually<BR>
&gt; made<BR>
&gt; it to remission since the onset of my crohns 2.5 years ago).  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Suddenly, though, I'm getting a bit concerned.  I've started bleeding<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; that was never one of my symptoms.  I don't have diarreah (I never did<BR>
&gt; have a<BR>
&gt; big problem with that).  The bleeding isn't continuous--just every<BR>
&gt; couple of<BR>
&gt; days--but when it appears there's quite a bit of it.  It's bright red<BR>
&gt; with a<BR>
&gt; few clots.  I've had some minor pain with it--it feels different than<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; crohns pain I've endured for so long.  I'm not bloated and don't feel<BR>
&gt; really<BR>
&gt; bad.  It's just kinda concerning.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Should I be worried?  I keep trying to tell myself that bleeding is a<BR>
&gt; normal<BR>
&gt; part of crohns and lots of people experience it.  I don't get the<BR>
&gt; impression<BR>
&gt; that it indicates some medical crisis but I don't know.  Should I rush<BR>
&gt; to see<BR>
&gt; my doctor?  Is there anything in particular as far as the diet that I<BR>
&gt; should<BR>
&gt; try?  I haven't added any new foods lately.  When the bleeding started<BR>
&gt; I was<BR>
&gt; overexerting myself--running up and down the stairs at a friend's<BR>
&gt; house<BR>
&gt; trying to care for her after surgery (I generally don't do stairs--I<BR>
&gt; live on<BR>
&gt; one floor at home).  But it hasn't cleared up since I moved back home<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; stopped racing around.<BR>

I've had bleeding on and off throughout my chrones during the last six <BR>
years. The worst part of my disease was within 12&quot; of the rectum. My <BR>
doctor said that when the blood is red that the problem is closer to the <BR>
rectum rather than farther up the digestive track.The closer that the <BR>
bleeding is to the beginning of the digestive track, the darker and <BR>
blacker the blood becomes. The one advantage of having bleeding episodes <BR>
closer to the rectum is that medication can be supplied directly to the <BR>
affected area via suppositories or enimas. My bleeding was rather bad <BR>
when I was first diagnosed with the disease 3 years ago, so my doctor <BR>
put me on on an enima (60ml of Rowasa) which I administered once a night <BR>
before I went to bed. I stayed on the the enima for two and a half <BR>
years. The area from about 6-12&quot; from my rectum looked like raw hmburger <BR>
meat before I went on the enima, but on my most recent scope checkup the <BR>
doctor told me that the whole area had completely healed with no <BR>
scarring. Now I use Rowasa suppositories on an as needed basis. If I <BR>
start to bleed from straining too much or for any other reason, I use <BR>
the suppositories for a few days to a week and the bleeding goes away. <BR>
 <BR>
If you've been straining to poop, this could also cause bleeding. Since <BR>
your bleeding just started I don't believe that your problem is <BR>
extremely serious, but it would be best to have your doctor check it out <BR>
anyway.<BR>

I don't know exactly the right label to put on my intestinal disorder as<BR>
yet as I only recently decided that it must be something other than, or<BR>
causative of, a Candida infection. I have finally gone to a &quot;real GI<BR>
doc&quot; who is running all the standard tests trying to put a label on it.<BR>
All I know is I get flare ups of nausea, intestinal discomfort and then<BR>
chronic diahrea and a weird sense of anxiety and brain fog and fatigue.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My personal opinion is that I have a leaky gut (which is also a test I<BR>
am having run to determine if true) and inflammation of my GI tract from<BR>
poor digestion of complex carbos and bacterial and fungal overgrowth due<BR>
to that.  Actually, that has been the revelation for me with SCD.  The<BR>
yeast is caused  by my inability to digest complex carbos and not caused<BR>
somehow by a defective, weak immune system which I could never seem<BR>
strengthen somehow, no matter how many &quot;immune boosting&quot; supplements I<BR>
would take,  etc. etc.<BR>

&gt; for<BR>
&gt; sharing your candida experience with me.  You gave it much more of a<BR>
&gt; try than<BR>
&gt; I did.  I was mixing nystatin powder as an anti-fungal but gave it up<BR>
&gt; when I<BR>
&gt; wouldn't stick with the diet.  I too was exhausted and had young<BR>
&gt; children at<BR>

&gt; please stay posted because I can relate to some things you talk about.<BR>
&gt; I<BR>
&gt; hope someone can help you with the reaction to the yogurt and<BR>
&gt; allowable<BR>
&gt; cheese.  I also get sick if I eat store bought yogurt or any milk<BR>
&gt; products so<BR>
&gt; I don't know if I should invest in a yogurt machine. I've heard that<BR>
&gt; because<BR>
&gt; it ferments ( I'm not sure that is the correct term) longer I might be<BR>
&gt; able<BR>
&gt; too, although you still have a problem.  Someone else said that they<BR>
&gt; did the<BR>
&gt; diet with great success and just left out the yogurt, while others say<BR>
&gt; they<BR>
&gt; felt it was a key component in getting well.  May I ask - what<BR>

Let me know how your tests turn out.  I took all those supplements too<BR>
(looked like a vitamin junky) - I went to a progressive health center - it<BR>
didn't work.  Now I get nausea when I take a multi-vitamin from the health<BR>
food store (wheat, starch, sugar free) If you're still taking alot of<BR>
vitamins you might try cutting back or stopping for a little while.  I know<BR>
Elaine recommends a particular kind, might try that. I certainly can relate<BR>
to brain fog and fatigue.  Brain fog seems to go away quickly when you start<BR>
the diet but I have a feeling the fatigue will take longer.  My stomach is<BR>
gowling and making alot of noise - I think it's wondering about the change in<BR>
diet!  Take care, Jane<BR>

I don't know, but together with some other people I am planning to do a<BR>
survey about SCD in Internet. Due to much work ( I work 113% now..) this<BR>
will unfortunately take some time.<BR>

If the yogurt looks and tastes OK after the 24 to 36 hours fermentation and<BR>
the temp has remainded over 90, Id guess it is just fine.<BR>

&gt;    Gwozdz,   I don't have any suggestions on how to stop your  problem,<BR>
&gt;but I just wanted to say that I have the exact same problem that you  do. I<BR>
&gt;found that when I reduce (don't eliminate) the amount of fruit and <BR>
&gt;vegetables that I consume, that my bowel movements become more soiled and<BR>
&gt;stay that way. I also found that I had to  eliminate all coffee and<BR>
&gt;ungrounded nuts from my diet. <BR>
<BR>
Yes, coffee is a real bitch re speeding up BM's ... basically, coffee is a<BR>
toxin, I've concluded.  Luckily I'm one of those rare people who really<BR>
dislikes the taste of coffee, even the &quot;ritzy&quot; high-priced ones, so I can<BR>
cast  such grand aspersions!  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The only fruit juice that  my system<BR>
&gt;tolerates is unsweeted pinaple juice. <BR>
<BR>
Have you tried fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice?  Especially with any<BR>
protein meal?  That's what my ND once suggested, and I found it really<BR>
worked well.  But specifically GRAPEFRUIT, no other citrus will do (incl.<BR>
pineapple, I found for myself ... &quot;results may differ&quot; for you?)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The other juices cause me  problems.<BR>
<BR>
Like I say, FRESH (not made in  a factory, but on your kitchen counter) <BR>
+ GRAPEFRUIT ... have you tried THAT?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I eat a lot of cheese, meat, eggs, and broccoli. For some reason  broccoli<BR>
&gt;really slows down the pace of bowel movements for me when other  vegetables<BR>
&gt;cause me problems when I eat too much them.   <BR>
<BR>
I found most cruciferous vegetables (e.g. broccoli, raw cabbage, brussels<BR>
sprouts) worked very well for my colitis to slow things down when I was in<BR>
a sub-acute stage.<BR>

&gt;I ended up going back on<BR>
&gt;Rowasa (mesalamine)  also.   Glenn <BR>

&gt;Hi all,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm thinking about writing a letter to CCFA asking them why they<BR>
&gt;choose to omit information about SCD.  But I first want to ask<BR>
&gt;if anyone knows if any formal studies have been done to see<BR>
&gt;what percentage of people on SCD are helped.  I have heard that<BR>
&gt;up to 75% who try the diet are helped.  But where does this statistic<BR>
&gt;come from?  And to what degree are the people helped?  Does everyone<BR>
&gt;reach a remission?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I would say &quot;no&quot; to the last question; bsed on both my own personal<BR>
results, and Elaine's clear statement (either on Mik's site, or in her<BR>
book) that approx. 20% of people will NOT get the desired results with the<BR>
SCD.<BR>
<BR>

What fruits are good to start with? I have had my son on a candida diet for<BR>
so long, I feel a little paranoid about fruits. How much fruit can he have?<BR>
