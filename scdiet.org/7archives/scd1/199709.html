I use a Vitamix, works like a blender and a food processer.  It purees an=<BR>
d<BR>
grinds and even cleans itself.  With a 2 HP motor it is pretty powerful. =<BR>

We use it most of all for yogurt smoothies and banana nut cake. =<BR>

<BR>
Hi All,<BR>
I've been reading about many people's problems with being able to<BR>
tolerate beans.<BR>
I want to share my solution to the associated problems of gas,<BR>
bloating,etc.<BR>
<BR>
2-3 years ago I began using a product called Beano on gaseous foods such<BR>
as pinto beans, cabbage, boiled eggs. Voila! Problem was solved.  Beano<BR>
has no taste, but MUST be put on the first bite of the offending food.<BR>
<BR>
Is there a reason more people on this diet or with IBD do not use it?<BR>
I've had Crohn's for 16 years and this has been the only way I've been<BR>
able to enjoy such foods.<BR>
<BR>
With the great results I've had, I've encouraged everyone I know to use<BR>
this product - even people with no bowel problems, just for the<BR>
resulting by-product (gas) of eating such foods.<BR>
<BR>
I strongly urge people to give this a try. Or, if there is some<BR>
scientific reason to avoid Beano, would someone let me know?<BR>
<BR>
I also use Lactaid (real or generic) with Great Success on dairy foods.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck<BR>

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;Hi,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;After more than 8 months of serious SCD, I have come to the conclusion<BR>
&gt;that this diet does not help my colon CD at all.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Now comes the obvious question: What to try next?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I still belive (or hope) that some diet can (to some extent) help with<BR>
&gt;this disease, but what diet?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Where do people go after SCD fails on them?<BR>
&gt;<BR>

The fundamental thing (at least for me) is: don't give up, and don't<BR>
surrender to conventional medicine.<BR>
<BR>
It seems that I'm more or less in the same situation you are, and now I'm<BR>
going to try Macrobiotics, wich is far more atractive to me (I used to be a<BR>
vegetarian). Someone (let's say, a Macrobiotic &quot;Doctor&quot;) told me that<BR>
usualy IBD can be controled within about 3 months. He told me what to do,<BR>
and I'm going to do it. We'll see what happens.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, I'm going to unsubscribe from the 2 lists now. I woul like to<BR>
thank everybody in these lists. There was a time when I got lots of useful<BR>
help from you all. Now, I have to confess that I find most of the messages<BR>
as boring and pointless chat.<BR>
<BR>
I'm still available to everyone who wants to contact me.<BR>
<BR>
Healthy days to everyone.<BR>

&gt;Hello &amp; thanks to all who answered my questions,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have tried several of the book's recipes with varying results. The<BR>
&gt;basic nut muffins &amp; the stir fry came out great. The zucchini pizza<BR>
&gt;crust &amp; the almond honey crisps were awful.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Possibly the problem with the pizza was that I used frozen,thawed grated<BR>
&gt;zucchini. I will use fresh next time.<BR>
<BR>
I have wonderful success with the pizza zucchini.  I use fresh zucchini.<BR>
It's the best recipe I have!<BR>

Dear listies,<BR>
<BR>
I started the SCD on July 29th, and initially had significant improvement:<BR>
stool frequency down to two a day (from several), with a little diarrhea<BR>
each time but mostly solid.  The bleeding did not stop, though.   I was<BR>
able to cut down from 20mg to 15 mg of prednisone (which I've been on<BR>
since, plus 12 asacols per day).  So, I'm one of those people for whom the<BR>
diet will probably work, according to Elaine.<BR>
<BR>
A couple of weeks ago I got worse:  more stool frequency, sometimes up to<BR>
10 per day, more diarrhea, more blood and mucus.  In short, a flare.  This<BR>
is always disheartening, the more so as I'm still on all those meds.  I<BR>
know Elaine's book says to expect a flare after one to three months, and to<BR>
bear with it.<BR>
<BR>
But how long do you bear with it?  And should I up my prednisone dose?   Of<BR>
course, if I do, and the flare clears, I won't know if it was the diet or<BR>
the pred.  And I won't know if the diet is being effective til I cut back<BR>
on the pred again.   I know if I ask my M.D. she'll say to go off the diet,<BR>
up my pred til I'm symptom free, and go on 6mp.  This is tempting, as 6mp<BR>
has a 70% success rate, but I'm trying to avoid being on an<BR>
immunosuppressant for the rest of my life!<BR>
<BR>
I've cut back to the very basic diet for several days, and have noticed<BR>
some improvement -- less stool frequency (but still not back down to 2 a<BR>
day), but just as much diarrhea -- some solid stool, but not much --  and<BR>
blood.  The most annoying sx is the nocturnal BM.  It wakes me up, and I<BR>
always have a real hard time going back to sleep, so I tend to be tired all<BR>
day, which of course does my flare no good.<BR>
<BR>
So, list-comrades, what do I do?  Any advice?  And especially, does anyone<BR>
have any experience with these 1-3 month flares?<BR>

Wow, does your MD actually think that diet makes a difference?  That's<BR>
incredible.  I had no trouble telling the difference between prednesone<BR>
induced changes and the effect of the diet.  Personally, I don't think<BR>
pred cures anything, but masks the acute stages of the flare-up -- the<BR>
cure comes from somewhere else, be it diet, less stress or<BR>
whatever.First, if you up the dose of the prednesone to your typical max<BR>
(I usually do 40mg), does it typically stop most of the bleeding<BR>
immediately?  If it does, then maybe you can hang at the lower dose for<BR>
awhile and suffer.  Its my opinion that many people overreact to the<BR>
bleeding, I've lived with bleeding for 3-4 weeks and my blood iron<BR>
levels didn't get too low.  Everyone, however is different.<BR>
<BR>

&gt;<BR>
<BR>
There is no reason to have to use it for the rest of your life.  If the<BR>
diet works, you will be able to quit.  My experience with quitting<BR>
wasn't very good, so I've committed to not going on it again.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I've cut back to the very basic diet for several days, and have<BR>
&gt; noticed<BR>
&gt; some improvement -- less stool frequency (but still not back down to 2<BR>

&gt; always have a real hard time going back to sleep, so I tend to be<BR>
&gt; tired all<BR>
&gt; day, which of course does my flare no good.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
First, I was quite successful at dividing my pred doses throughout the<BR>
day -- I was previously taking the whole dose in the morning with the<BR>
idea that it wouldn't affect my sleep as much.  Right now I'm taking 25<BR>
mg, -- 10 breakfast, 10 lunch, 5 dinner.  I had some sleepless nights<BR>
because I took too much at dinnertime, after some experimentation I<BR>
found that 5 mg seems to not keep me up.  Anyway, the difference was<BR>
miraculous.<BR>
<BR>
Been there with the nighttime problems.  You could eliminate honey and<BR>
juice for a couple of days.  If it helps, I would say that you have a<BR>
case of candida that is main cause of your flare.  This is what I think<BR>
happened to me, and eliminating the sweets made a difference.<BR>
<BR>
Personally, I couldn't sustain the diet without the added carbs of the<BR>
fruit and honey and I got pretty damn sick -- it did work for three days<BR>
however.  In my case, I decided to add low gluten grains to the basic<BR>
diet and still eliminate honey and juice, and I'm doing pretty well<BR>
right now.<BR>

Hello Everyone!!!!!<BR>

My doctor just prescribed Pentasa to me.  He suggested I take 16 pills a<BR>
day as well as being on the diet.  Is anyone else on Pentasa and how much<BR>
do you take?  My inquiring mind would like to know.  And have you noticed<BR>

I suppose there are folks who can relate to walking away from milk being<BR>
boiled to make yoghurt! Yeech, talk about a mess!  Anyway, I bought a<BR>
cheap Casio watch that has both a timer and a stop watch, so no matter<BR>
where I go, I will hear it go off!  Setting a timer in the kitchen just<BR>
dosen't work, especially if I go downstairs to read my SCD-list<BR>
E-mail!!!  I usually have the timer set at 29 minutes since I've figured<BR>
that's the ideal time for my muffins which I eat constantly.<BR>
<BR>
When are we going to have &quot;the Great SCD Cook-off&quot;, to sample each<BR>
other's fares?    Would we bring our foods pre-cooked, or cook them in<BR>
some large kitchen?  Whose muffins are the fluffiest? Does anyone think<BR>
this would be a fun idea?  Is it feasible? Maybe some off-season<BR>
ski-resort in Canada that has a huge kitchen that isn't being used this<BR>
time of year. Just think, we wouldn't have to worry about telling each<BR>
other why we can't eat this or that!  And, we could stuff ourselves!<BR>
Whaddya say, whaddya say? Lets do it!<BR>

&gt;  &gt;Well seems that staying up late has price to it.<BR>
&gt;  &gt;<BR>
&gt;  &gt;The last three nights I've stayed up 'till midnight making SCD<BR>
&gt;  &gt;food. This includes 2 weeks supply of soup, 3-4 weeks of hamburgers,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;  &gt;cheese cake, home-made grape jello, yogurt, and last night the<BR>

&gt;  &gt;had a visitor until 11pm and I still wanted to make my cookies<BR>
&gt;  &gt;after since I was taking Friday off from work.  After putting in<BR>
&gt;  &gt;my 3rd batch (2 dozen at a time) of cookies, I went downstairs to<BR>
&gt;  &gt;watch TV.  Twoo hours later I realized that I had fallen asleep<BR>

&gt; from work planning to have meatloaf for supper that I made last<BR>
&gt; night.  I<BR>
&gt; only needed to make ketchup to go with it.  Luckily I had already<BR>
&gt; bought a<BR>
&gt; bunch of fresh tomatoes to make it with.  I scalded them, peeled them,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; chopped them, and boiled them up.  Added seasoning, reduced it a bit,<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; then poured the boiling mass into the blender.  I put the top on and<BR>
&gt; held it<BR>
&gt; down, turned on the blender, and the force was tremendous!  It sprayed<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; scalding tomatoes all over me and all over the kitchen.  My face and<BR>
&gt; one arm<BR>
&gt; were immediately painful.  My housemate ended up helping me get ice on<BR>
&gt; my<BR>
&gt; face and cleaning up most of the mess.  It was pretty traumatic.  He<BR>
&gt; finished<BR>
&gt; the blending and I had supper (after I changed clothes, put on salve,<BR>
&gt; cleaned<BR>
&gt; tomatoes out of my hair....)  When I finished supper I decided to<BR>
&gt; avoid the<BR>
&gt; kitchen for the rest of the night and get in bed with a book.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; This is the only group I could admit this to!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; My housemate says I should buy a food processor and that way these<BR>
&gt; things<BR>
&gt; won't happen.  He says that with a food processor, the ingredients are<BR>
&gt; locked<BR>
&gt; in and won't push their way out.  Is he right?  Would this be a wise<BR>
&gt; investment in my personal safety?  (I keep thinking I'll get used to<BR>
&gt; using<BR>
&gt; the blender for such things but this is my second disaster)<BR>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had this &quot;bloating&quot; problem?  I was having it when I<BR>
&gt; was<BR>
&gt; &gt; not quite in the state of remission I find myself, and it scared me<BR>
&gt; away<BR>
&gt; &gt; from the beans.  More specifically, has anyone out there who has<BR>
&gt; gotten<BR>
&gt; &gt; &quot;better&quot; from the diet gone on to eat the beans without any<BR>
&gt; problems?<BR>
&gt; &gt; I'd love to eat them again, since they are so cheap compared to<BR>
&gt; other<BR>
&gt; &gt; &quot;legal&quot; foodstuffs like almond flour, but I'm scared it might make<BR>
&gt; me<BR>
&gt; &gt; sick again...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Dear Matthew,<BR>
&gt; I tried the beans after having been on the diet for a few months, and<BR>
&gt; did<BR>
&gt; great. Sometimes I'd make the recipe in the book, or I'd cook the<BR>
&gt; beans<BR>
&gt; until tender in nothing but water and salt. The plain ones I liked<BR>
&gt; served<BR>
&gt; with cheddar cheese and fresh salsa on top. After several months of<BR>
&gt; success<BR>
&gt; with the beans, all of a sudden I started noticing the bloating<BR>
&gt; problem, so<BR>
&gt; I decided to quit eating them for a while. I tried again 2 or 3 more<BR>
&gt; times<BR>
&gt; with a break in between, without success. It would take about 2 weeks<BR>
&gt; for<BR>
&gt; the bloating to subside. About a year ago I decided to give the<BR>
&gt; lentils a<BR>
&gt; try. Surprisingly, I have absolutely no problem with them. I've been<BR>
&gt; buying<BR>
&gt; red lentils, because it looks like they don't have a skin. You can<BR>
&gt; make<BR>
&gt; great soups with lentils, and they are also inexpensive. I've been<BR>
&gt; thinking<BR>
&gt; of trying the beans again soon, but I'm waiting for a time when I<BR>
&gt; don't<BR>
&gt; have much going on in case I have to go through the 2 weeks...  My<BR>
&gt; plan is<BR>
&gt; to eat a small amount the first day, and if I do OK, then eat a little<BR>
&gt; more<BR>
&gt; the next, but not overdo it.<BR>
&gt; I would also be interested in hearing about other people's experience<BR>
&gt; with<BR>
&gt; the beans.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha, normally I use the timer on the microwave to remind me of<BR>
when to check on the food I am cooking/baking.  However, after 10pm at<BR>
night I try not to use it for fear of waking up my toddler when the<BR>
beeps go off.  Trying to get a toddler back to sleep is a long process<BR>
most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
Ellen, sorry about your catsup disaster.  I'll remember that when I get<BR>
to making catsup, when I finally start using tomatoes.  I feel pretty<BR>
good that I am finally using bananas :)  They are very good in the cake<BR>
and muffin recipes.  By the way, I use a food processor and blender for<BR>
different things.  I use the blender to make a double batch of the cheese<BR>
cake (I eat 3 slices daily), which fills right up to the top (this then<BR>
fits into a 9&quot; square pan very well).<BR>
<BR>
To anyone on this list who does not like the many messages sent on a daily<BR>
basis, may I suggest that you re-subscribe with the *digest* mode.  This<BR>

Hi Ron,<BR>
<BR>
You may want to check out the yogurt maker by Salton Maxim. Their web <BR>
page address is listed below. The web page contains specifics about the <BR>
yogurt maker, along with a picture and info on how to order one.<BR>
<BR>
http://www.salton-maxim.com/healthyalt/funfoods.html<BR>

I bought this yogurt maker after a recommendation from someone on this <BR>

To Lynn re:gaining weight: I am assuming you're on the SCD diet and don't eat<BR>
carbohydrates, right???  I was also 95 lbs 'til I got rid of intestinal yeast<BR>
and parasites using Diflucan (Rx), and herbals.  Then, I gained near 15 lbs<BR>
eating nuts, proteins (meat/fish), lots of winter squash (acorn, spagetti,<BR>
butter nut, etc.) and lots of vegetables.  Also use a lot of Flax oil, and<BR>
the SCD diet for nut-based breads.  My weight is now stable (for last 4 mos.)<BR>
 But none of this would have worked if I hadn't gotten rid of the little<BR>
beasties first! Good luck.<BR>

Here are the calcium amounts you asked about:<BR>

1 cup raw, chopped broccoli   42.2 mg<BR>
1 cup frozen, chopped, boiled broccoli  93.8 mg<BR>
1 oz (about 24 nuts) almonds  75.4 mg<BR>
<BR>
Also, I heard that sesame seeds had a lot so I looked them up too.<BR>
<BR>
1/4 cup dry hulled sesame seeds  49.1 mg<BR>
<BR>
For comparison, 1 cup of milk has around 300 mg.<BR>

I had the early flare up that Elaine mentions in her book and I remember <BR>
how frustrating it was.  I was so excited about my initial improvement, <BR>
that I almost had myself believing that I wasn't going to get bad again.  <BR>
I think it lasted almost 2 weeks, and I didn't change anything while it <BR>
was happening, just sort of rode it out.<BR>
As for the bleeding.  Well, that was my last symptom to go and it took <BR>
months.  It was probably a few months before I started to see <BR>
improvements and then the bleeding got less and less frequent until it <BR>
was gone completely.<BR>
You also asked about increasing your prednisone dose and if you do that <BR>
how would you know if the diet or the pred is helping you.  Well, I <BR>
guess what you have to decide is would you rather get better now and not <BR>
know for the next flare how it happened, or would you rather suffer a <BR>
little now and then next time know right away how to get better.  <BR>
Personally, I would go with using both medication (if it has worked for <BR>
you in the past) and the diet.  I don't really care what is making me <BR>
better, I just want to be better.  But, of course, it's an individual <BR>
choice.<BR>

Kurt,<BR>
<BR>
This may sound frustrating but our experience is that where CD is <BR>
invloved in the colon, the SCD may take longer to take effect.  Back in <BR>
the early days of the SCD for our daughter, there seemed little or no <BR>
progress after 8 months.  After a very encouraging discussion with <BR>
Elaine she reminded us that everyone responds differently and yes, some <BR>
do not respond at all. Further, all should make a personal <BR>
decisions as to th e management of their own health.  I commend <BR>
you for trying and not bowing to the dictates of &quot;conventional <BR>
wisdom&quot;.  Assuming that you want to stick with the SCD I would <BR>
like to share our experiences with you.  Back to Elaine's <BR>
discussion, her comments were 1) was there fanatical <BR>
adherence to the diet - in our case - yes (what about you Kurt?) 2) was <BR>
there any signs of progress, even small, in our case yes - again, Kurt, <BR>
did you notice anything? even small things such as less tummy grumbling, <BR>
less pain, no joint pain.  Was there anything you experienced Kurt?  <BR>
Elaine's response was that in the early going where the colon is so <BR>
actively involved there is a needed period to get the colon back to its <BR>
proper function - that of primarily extracting water and salts.  In <BR>
active disease, the colon becomes a fermentation duct and its balance is <BR>
thrown out.  With Crohn's Colitis (CD of the colon) this can take time. <BR>
 After 8 months or so with meds the diet provided the adjunct to help <BR>
the progress. (are you on any meds Kurt?)  It is now 19 months on the <BR>
diet and just over a year with meds.  Her progress has been steady, but <BR>
she is not what we would term &quot;in remission&quot; yet.  She is close to <BR>
getting back to her body weight (she was over 40lbs underweight) for her <BR>
height of 5 7&quot;.  She has started school again and she is venturing out <BR>
with here friends.  Things are not terrific but they are much better.  <BR>
The bottom line for her was that the diet was the only right way to eat <BR>
for her condition.  It makes so much sense to maximize nutritional <BR>
potential while minimizing the digestive activity - thus creating the <BR>
best possible environment for bowel rest without the harmful side <BR>
effects of TPN, Enteral Feeding, NG tubes, etc.<BR>
<BR>
We always remember that this diet works at the microbiological level, so <BR>
it is not a diet that like others that can be &quot;cheated&quot; on once in a <BR>
while without punity.  To cheat is to setback significant gains that may <BR>
have taken months to build.  hence, the reason that Elaine and others <BR>
are adamant about sticking to the diet in every respect.  Kurt, we <BR>
understand how frustrating this is but ask yourself, what better way is <BR>
there to eat? you have to eat something so why not a well thought out <BR>
and balanced diet such as the SCD.  We share many of the meals with our <BR>
daughter and quite frankly, we do not miss potatoes and rice and the <BR>
like.  Apart from our daughter there is no IBD in our families.  We <BR>
share hers and by extension your anxieties.  Whatever you do, you <BR>
obviously think things through, keep it up.!! Kurt, hang in there and <BR>
like others told us &quot;this too will pass&quot; <BR>
<BR>
All the best,<BR>

<BR>
Hi,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for all the mail!  A few questions were raised:<BR>
<BR>
1) Did I follow the diet 100%? Yes - fanatically. I have not even been <BR>
to a resturant for 8 months in fear of bad bacteria. Whenever I visit <BR>
friends I cook my own food. No cheating. Homemade yoghurt from day 1.<BR>
<BR>
2) Did I talk to Elaine? Yes. She said after a few weeks with no <BR>
progress just drop the diet - it won't work. She said 30-40% does not <BR>
improve on the diet. Then she started recommending various medication, <BR>
that I know all too well.<BR>
<BR>
3) Was I on medication? Yes - Pentasa + prednisolone tapered from 50mg <BR>
down to 10mg. When reaching 10mg prednisolone I had to go up again. So <BR>
for 8 months I have not been off prednisolone for one day, and that is <BR>
the primary goal for me - to get of prednisolone.<BR>
<BR>
4) Did I experience any improvement? No. But it's very difficult to talk <BR>
about improvement when the medecine alone makes you feel good. <BR>
<BR>
5) Have I tried skipping diary? No. Just eliminating diary from SCD <BR>
removes the source of &quot;good bacteria&quot; (yoghurt). What other sources are <BR>
there? (I don't think eating tons of &quot;saurkraut&quot; is the right thing to <BR>
do).<BR>
<BR>

In a message dated 97-09-16 00:09:12 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Does anyone know if grinding almonds in a coffee bean grinder will grind <BR>
 them to the consistency of the almond flour you can mail order? &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I used a krups coffee mill and it did a nice job, but it still wasn't quite<BR>
as fine as Hughsons.  I started with sliced unblanched almonds and processed<BR>
for mental count of 8.  It turned out sort of like wheat flour.  Baked goods<BR>
with it had a somewhat coarser texture than with Hughsons--you could sense<BR>
that they had ground nuts in the recipe and needed to chew a bit more--but it<BR>
wasn't unpleasant, just different, and in some ways a nice change of pace.<BR>
 Part of the difference could have been blanched vs unblanched almonds.  The<BR>
Hughson's flour is so light in color that I'm pretty sure they use blanched<BR>
almonds.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this helps.<BR>

I don't know what other sources there are that are non-dairy.  You could<BR>
consider acidopholis supplements though.  Personnally, I'm thinking about<BR>
eliminating the dairy for a couple of weeks and see what difference it makes.<BR>
 I've had a bad reaction to the yogurt 3 times out of 4 lately.  When I<BR>
ingest it, I quickly get an intensely painful spasming in my lower abdomen<BR>
and within minutes of that I have a round of diarreah.  Nothing else on this<BR>
diet so far seems to bother me.  I'm thinking about getting my calcium from<BR>
other sources (spinach, broccoli, figs, almonds) and skipping the yogurt.<BR>
 (By the way, I use yogourmet starter and a yogourmet yogurt maker.)  I've<BR>
heard that two weeks is a good trial period to see whether eliminating dairy<BR>
(but otherwise staying on the SCD) is helpful so I will probably try that and<BR>
see.  <BR>

Hello Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
	Welcome to the Specific Carbohydrate Diet forum. The agenda here is<BR>
the discussion of a book called &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; written by<BR>
Elaine Gottschall. The book contains the diet developed by Dr. Sidney<BR>
Valentine Haas which has an astoundingly high success rate in the treatment<BR>
of inflammatory bowel disease. The diet cured Elaine Gottschall's younger<BR>
daughter over forty years ago of ulcerative colitis after various medical<BR>
approaches were no longer effective and surgery appeared imminent. Ms.<BR>
Gottschall entered university at that time in an effort to try and<BR>
understand how something as simple as a dietary change could reverse a<BR>
so-called incurable disease. She spent twelve years in the research<BR>
community at three leading North American universities. This scientific<BR>
training combined with seven years of consulting convinced her of the<BR>
effectiveness of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet in reversing many<BR>
gastrointestinal disorders, especially inflammatory bowel disease. The<BR>
book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle, is her contribution as a scientific<BR>
hypothesis upon which future researchers can do further work. For many of<BR>
us the book is also the source of restored health. If anyone is finding<BR>
difficulty in locating a copy of  the book, it will be available through<BR>
this list.<BR>
<BR>
	Many of us who have been on the diet for any length of time have<BR>
experienced the miraculous healing powers of this diet and are here to<BR>
share our experience and tips for living with it. In the process,  perhaps<BR>
we can learn a few things ourselves. Some of us have additionally<BR>
discovered adjunct therapies (exercise, allowable supplements, ect.) and<BR>
these contributions  may be helpful. It is important however to focus on<BR>
the diet itself. There are many diets and many forms of alternative<BR>
medicines available that promise to aid those suffering with IBD. For that<BR>
purpose, there are many lists and web sites out there to provide<BR>
information on these. This list  however, has been formed to promote and<BR>
discuss the &quot;Specific Carbohydrate diet&quot; exclusively. Forums usually have a<BR>
chairperson in place to help direct issues that pertain to the subject at<BR>
hand. As there will be no governing bodies here, it is asked that we<BR>
individually use self-restraint to ensure that the subject of the SCD<BR>
remains the primary focus.  Most of us here can address questions from<BR>
newcomers and welcome the opportunity to do so. Elaine is not on the<BR>
internet. She does plan on being available to answer the tricky stuff and<BR>
promises to occasionally forward comments to the group.<BR>
<BR>
	 It is our hopes that we can continue to grow and to assist the portion of our<BR>
society plagued by IBD,  towards restored health. Life without pain,<BR>
bleeding and the constant search for a bathroom is indeed a blessing.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Rachel Turet<BR>

. 	Dear Kurt,<BR>

whirl . I have been on the diet almost one year minus the dairy.And my<BR>
colon is fixed 99.9 percent. You could just be one of those people that are<BR>
allergic to dairy. The diet is still very doable without the dairy, I am<BR>
proof of that. Try two weeks no dairy and see what happens. I had a major<BR>
yeast problem before the diet and that is now just fine also.<BR>

<BR>
Hi Lynn,<BR>
<BR>
I used to take 4 Pentasa a day since May/95.  My new doctor here (I moved<BR>
this year) wanted me to increase it to 8/day if I wanted to do the diet.<BR>
I had lost 10 pounds since January (new job, new city, new house, ...), and<BR>
was having more bloating/pain/BM. He wanted me to start nightly tube-feeding,<BR>
but I took this as a major warning sign (another operation) that I would<BR>
now start the SCD diet.<BR>
<BR>
So, in your case, taking 16/day is up to your doctor and you (and how you feel<BR>
about it).  If it is your first time taking it, and depending on the severity<BR>
of your symptoms, I would think taking less should be ok (but I dislike doctors<BR>
and their attitudes towards drugs).  It's always your choice, doctors should<BR>
never be put up on a pedestal.<BR>
<BR>
The diet is helping me and I have regained 6-8 pounds (all in the last three weeks)<BR>
since my first visit with the doctor in May/97.  I have just crossed 12 weeks on<BR>
the diet, and still not introducing too many foods.  Nut muffins and cookies are<BR>
the best, and I also started eating peanut butter (all natural--just peanuts).<BR>
<BR>
All the best and continued good health.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

I had a flare not that long ago, I started taking prednisone and<BR>
asacol.  Now, about two months later, I'm off the meds (well, I'm STILL<BR>
tapering off the pred, taking 5mg. every other day) but my diarhea is<BR>
gone.  This seems to be the main obstable, since it seems that all the<BR>
high-water content foods in the diet are essential to building strength,<BR>
yet they don't help in getting rid of the diareah. So, I suggest (from<BR>
my experience, I'm no expert except with my own body) sticking with the<BR>
meds and the diet, and waiting it out. I've alos observed what appears<BR>
to be &quot;cycles&quot; where I come into remission. Maybe your cycle is due for<BR>
remission!  The only reason I'm not at 0mg. with the prednisone is that<BR>
if I stop too soon, I &quot;crash&quot;, and get headaches.  I expect to be off<BR>
all drugs again by the end of September.<BR>
All the best to you, from someone who has been there!<BR>

&gt; Dear listies,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I started the SCD on July 29th, and initially had significant<BR>
&gt; improvement:<BR>
&gt; stool frequency down to two a day (from several), with a little<BR>
&gt; diarrhea<BR>
&gt; each time but mostly solid.  The bleeding did not stop, though.   I<BR>
&gt; was<BR>
&gt; able to cut down from 20mg to 15 mg of prednisone (which I've been on<BR>
&gt; since, plus 12 asacols per day).  So, I'm one of those people for whom<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; diet will probably work, according to Elaine.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; A couple of weeks ago I got worse:  more stool frequency, sometimes up<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; 10 per day, more diarrhea, more blood and mucus.  In short, a flare.<BR>
&gt; This<BR>
&gt; is always disheartening, the more so as I'm still on all those meds.<BR>
&gt; I<BR>
&gt; know Elaine's book says to expect a flare after one to three months,<BR>
&gt; and to<BR>
&gt; bear with it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; But how long do you bear with it?  And should I up my prednisone<BR>
&gt; dose?   Of<BR>
&gt; course, if I do, and the flare clears, I won't know if it was the diet<BR>
&gt; or<BR>
&gt; the pred.  And I won't know if the diet is being effective til I cut<BR>
&gt; back<BR>
&gt; on the pred again.   I know if I ask my M.D. she'll say to go off the<BR>
&gt; diet,<BR>
&gt; up my pred til I'm symptom free, and go on 6mp.  This is tempting, as<BR>
&gt; 6mp<BR>
&gt; has a 70% success rate, but I'm trying to avoid being on an<BR>
&gt; immunosuppressant for the rest of my life!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I've cut back to the very basic diet for several days, and have<BR>
&gt; noticed<BR>
&gt; some improvement -- less stool frequency (but still not back down to 2<BR>
&gt; a<BR>
&gt; day), but just as much diarrhea -- some solid stool, but not much --<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; blood.  The most annoying sx is the nocturnal BM.  It wakes me up, and<BR>
&gt; I<BR>
&gt; always have a real hard time going back to sleep, so I tend to be<BR>
&gt; tired all<BR>
&gt; day, which of course does my flare no good.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; So, list-comrades, what do I do?  Any advice?  And especially, does<BR>
&gt; anyone<BR>
&gt; have any experience with these 1-3 month flares?<BR>

This recipe came out of the Moosewood Restaurant Cookbook.<BR>
<BR>
MOOSEWOOD HOUSE SALAD DRESSING<BR>
<BR>
1 cup veg. oil (mild, not olive)<BR>
2 Tbl lemon juice <BR>
1 tsp honey	<BR>
6 spinach leaves<BR>
2 Tbl chopped parsley<BR>
1 tsp fresh basil, or 1/4 tsp dried	<BR>
1tsp fresh marjoram, or 1/4 tsp dried<BR>
1/2 tsp salt<BR>
1 garlic clove, pressed<BR>
1 cup yogurt<BR>
<BR>
Blend all ingredients except the yogurt. Slowly add the yogurt, don't<BR>
overmix or will separate. This will keep refrigerated for up to a week. <BR>
I've found that it does separate after a day or two, so just stir before<BR>
you use it. <BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt; I'm writing from Toronto, Ontario, Canada and I'm having some <BR>
 &gt;difficulty locating a yoghurt maker.<BR>
 &gt;Does anybody have suggestions on where I can locate one? &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
You can order a yogourmet yogurt maker by calling 514-562-8525.  They are in<BR>
Montreal.  Perhaps they can recommend a local distributor.  The yogourmet<BR>
yogurt maker makes 2 liters at a time in one large container suitable for<BR>
storing the yogurt in the fridge.  I highly recommend buying an additional<BR>
yogurt container so you can start your next batch as you are finishing the<BR>
first.  I find this much more convenient than the type that uses little jars.<BR>

The information that I am passing along is just a description of the symptoms<BR>
(below).  I typed it all in so that Arlene (who is in Instanbul) could get<BR>
some insight into her situation.  As far as diet, the consistent theme in my<BR>
reading on the subject is to give up sugar and all other refined<BR>
carbohydrates.  I am on the SCD diet for my crohns disease and so only looked<BR>
into the dietary aspects of fibromyalgia to make sure that a diet such as SCD<BR>
wasn't contraindicated in any way (it's not).  I have found that the SCD is<BR>
improving my crohns and either that or other things I'm doing are improving<BR>
my fibro!<BR>
<BR>
Ellen<BR>
<BR>
The original list, typed in from a brochure is included below.  In addition,<BR>
I have typed in an edited portion from the book &quot;Fibromyalgia: A<BR>
Comprehensive Approach&quot;.  It offers more detail in some areas than the other<BR>
list.  I have a lot of literature and names/addresses of organizations as<BR>
well.  Let me know if you want more info.<BR>
<BR>
No two people experience fibromyalgia in exactly the same way.  This makes it<BR>
very difficult to diagnosse, but there is one physical finding that is<BR>
definitive.  People with fibromyalgia have a sore or painfully tender feeling<BR>
in some or all of the eighteen &quot;tender points&quot;.  The American College of<BR>
Rheumatology says that if you hurt when at least eleven of these eighteen<BR>
tender points are pressed, and you ache all over, then you have FM.<BR>
<BR>
Another diagnostic criterion is the presence of pain in all four quadrants of<BR>
the body--left and right sides above the waist, left and right sides below<BR>
the waist, for at least three months.  <BR>
<BR>
Pain is not all there is to fibromyalgia.  Disordered sleep afflicts about 75<BR>
percent (some researchers say up to 94 percent) of all people with<BR>
fibromyalgia.  People who have fibromyalgia usually report that they sleep<BR>
lightly, are awakened by the slightest sound, and do not feel rested and<BR>
refreshed in the morning.  When they awaken in the morning these people feel<BR>
tired, achy, and stiff.  Some people think this lack of restful sleep causes<BR>
FM; others think that FM pain causes the lack of restful sleep. [Note from<BR>
Ellen:  There was a study where healthy individuals were deprived of delta<BR>
sleep and they developed the symptoms of FM.  I think the sleep problem is<BR>
the source and the best point of attack.  For me, if I can sleep well, I feel<BR>
better in all respects.]<BR>
<BR>
About half of FM patients complain of migraine or tension heachaches.  About<BR>
a quarter of FM patients suffer from temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder,<BR>
a painful condition thought to be related to the muscles and ligaments<BR>
surrounding the hinges of the jaw but not the joint itself.<BR>
<BR>
More than half of the people with FM suffer from irritable bowel syndrome<BR>
(IBS).  The most common symptom is crampy diarrhea that is often confused<BR>
with colitis or Crohns disease.  But IBS can also make itself known by<BR>
causing constipation, abdominal pain, abdominal gas, and nausea.  FM can<BR>
involve gastresophageal reflux--a sour tasting reverse flow of partially<BR>
digested food to the back of the throat that people sometimes call acid<BR>
stomach or heartburn.<BR>
<BR>
Many people think the worst part of fibromyalgia are the memory and reasoning<BR>
problems that often come with it.  People afflicted with this cognitive<BR>
dysfunction complain of being unable to remember things they have just been<BR>
told, or to think a problem through to its conclusion.  Others speak of<BR>
&quot;brain fog,&quot; a feeling that clouds inhabit the brain, that there is a fog<BR>
surrounding them that keeps them from really being in the world.  <BR>
<BR>
Other symptoms sometimes present with fibromyalgia:<BR>
<BR>
--Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and painful menstruation<BR>
--Numbness and tingling sensations<BR>
--Muscle twitching<BR>
--Water retention and swelling--especially of the hands, face, and feet.<BR>
--Dry eyes and mouth<BR>
--Dizziness<BR>
--Skin sensitivity--itching and burning<BR>
--Impaired coordination<BR>
--Urinary urgency and/or burning<BR>
--Chest pain and pressure beneath the breast bone<BR>
--Intermittent hearing problems and low-frequency hearing loss<BR>
<BR>
All of these symptoms can be triggered or make worse by weather changes, cold<BR>
or drafty environments, hormonal changes before menstruation or during<BR>
menopause, stress, depression, anxiety, and physical overexertion.<BR>

This is exerpted from a brochure by the Fibromyalgia Association of Greater<BR>
Washington Inc.<BR>
<BR>
What is Fibromyalgia Syndrome?<BR>
<BR>
Fibromyalgia syndrome (or FMS for short) is a complex, chronic condition<BR>
which causes widespread pain and profound fatigue, as well as a variety of<BR>
other symptoms.  As its name suggests, fibromyalgia primarily affects the<BR>
soft tissues of the body.  Unlike arthritis, fibromyalgia does not cause pain<BR>
or swelling in the joints; rather, it produces pain in the soft tissues<BR>
around joints and throughout the body.  <BR>
<BR>
The pain of fibromyalgia usually consists of diffuse aching or burning, often<BR>
described as head-to-toe.  Its severity varies from day to day and can change<BR>
location, becoming more severe in parts of the body that are used the most.<BR>
 In some people, the pain can be intense enough to interfere with ordinary,<BR>
daily tasks, while in others it causes only mild discomfort.  FMS pain is<BR>
often accompanied by muscle spasm.<BR>
<BR>
The fatique of fibromyalgia also varies from person to person.  It ranges<BR>
from a mild, tired feeling to the exhaustion of a flu-like illness.  Like<BR>
pain, it also tends to come and go.<BR>
<BR>
Other Symptoms<BR>
<BR>
In addition to pain and fatique, FMS may produce one or more of the following<BR>
classic symptoms:<BR>
<BR>
Sleep Disturbances:  Despite sufficient amounts of sleep, FMS patients may<BR>
awaken feeling unrefreshed, as if they have barely slept.  Alternatively,<BR>
they may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.  The reasons for the<BR>
non-restorative sleep and other sleep difficulties of fibromyalgia are<BR>
unknown.  However, early FMS research in sleep labs documented disruptions in<BR>
the deep (delta) sleep of some fibromyalgia patients.<BR>
<BR>
Stiffness:  In addition to pain, body stiffness may prove a nagging problem<BR>
for persons with FMS.  Such stiffness may be particularly apparent in the<BR>
early morning, after prolonged periods of sitting or standing in one<BR>
position, or with changes in temperature or relative humidity.<BR>
<BR>
Increased Headaches or Facial Pain:  Fibromyalgia patients may experience<BR>
frequent migrain, tension, or vascular headaches.  Headache pain may also<BR>
consist of referred paint to the temporal area (temples) or behind the eyes.<BR>
 Approximately one-third of patients with FMS are thought to have pain and<BR>
dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, or TMJ which produces not only<BR>
headaches but also jaw and facial pain.<BR>
<BR>
Abdominal Discomfort:  Many persons with FMS experience digestive<BR>
disturbances, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and/or diarrhea.  These<BR>
symptoms, as a whole, are usually called irritable bowel syndrome.<BR>
<BR>
Irritable Bladder:  FMS patients may complain of increased frequency of<BR>
urination or increased urgency to urinate.<BR>
<BR>
Paresthesia:  Numbness or tingling (for example, in the hands or feet)<BR>
sometimes accompanies FMS.  Also known as paresthesia, the sensation can be<BR>
described as prickling or burning.<BR>
<BR>
Cold Hands or Feet:  An unusual sensitivity to cold in the extremities,<BR>
accompanied by color changes, is sometimes experienced by persons with<BR>
fibromyalgia.  This condition is known as Raynaud's Phenomenon.<BR>
<BR>
Skin Complaints:  Nagging symptoms, such as itchy, dry, or blotchy skin may<BR>
accompany FMS.  Fibromyalgia patients may also experience a sensation of<BR>
swelling, particularly in the extremities, like fingers.  A common complaint<BR>
is that a ring no longer fits on a finger.  Such swelling, however, is not<BR>
equivalent to the joint inflammation of arthritis; rather, it is a localized<BR>
anomaly of fibromyalgia whose cause is currently unknown.<BR>
<BR>
Chest Pains:  Although some persons with FMS may be initially misdiagnosed<BR>
with heart disease, the chest pains associated with fibromyalgia usually<BR>
result from muscle pain which occurs where the ribs meet the chest bone.<BR>
<BR>
Cognitive Disorders:  Persons with fibromyalgia report a number of cognitive<BR>
symptoms which tend to vary from day to day.  These include difficulty<BR>
concentrating, &quot;spaciness&quot;, memory lapses, and being overwhelmed easily.<BR>
<BR>
Depression and Anxiety:  Although FMS patients are frequently misdiagnosed<BR>
with depression or anxiety disorders, these conditions are often a result of<BR>
the chronic pain of FMS rather than the cause of those symptoms.<BR>

I too am one of the folks who had to give up all dairy to make the diet<BR>

to tolerate it.<BR>

sorry i left off a 'w' from  www4, i fixed it below, by then way<BR>
read the three abstracts that are returned when you search for<BR>
colitis AND margarine. these are fairly recent studies done in<BR>
japan and the UK on the role of diet and colitis.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you can search the NINE MILLION absracts (some dont have them) to<BR>
you hearts content at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
http://www4.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed  (case insensitive ) for your search<BR>
option chose MEDLINE<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
i try things like<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
colitis AND eicosanoid  (case sensitive)<BR>
<BR>
or<BR>
colitis AND chelation   (the AND seems to be upper case sensistive)<BR>
<BR>
or<BR>
&quot;ulcerative colitis&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you'll get too many to read all of them, but look at the MeSH terms at<BR>
the bottom of each article for clues on what key words are common to<BR>
your area of interest.<BR>

Dear Ellen,<BR>
Me too!! I'm in contact with the listserver &amp; we seem to be fine. They'll<BR>
let me know for sure, but what I think happened is that someone tried to<BR>
unsubscribe &amp; instead of using their own name in the body of the message<BR>
they named the list. FYI, the listserver let me know that we currently have<BR>
114 members on the list (where is everybody??) I went into this list with<BR>
basically a novice level understanding of computers and lists and in the<BR>
hopes that the important &quot;stuff&quot; will be handled by the listserver. I think<BR>
that they are doing a decent job. There always seem to be some kind of<BR>
complaints going on, one persone says there are too many messages, another<BR>
complains about repetition. Someone even called us &quot;boring&quot; recently, but I<BR>
for one, would be very upset if this list was lost. I find the exchanges<BR>

&gt;Dear Ellen,<BR>
&gt;Me too!! I'm in contact with the listserver &amp; we seem to be fine. They'll<BR>
&gt;let me know for sure, but what I think happened is that someone tried to<BR>
&gt;unsubscribe &amp; instead of using their own name in the body of the message<BR>
&gt;they named the list. FYI, the listserver let me know that we currently have<BR>
&gt;114 members on the list (where is everybody??) I went into this list with<BR>
&gt;basically a novice level understanding of computers and lists and in the<BR>
&gt;hopes that the important &quot;stuff&quot; will be handled by the listserver. I think<BR>
&gt;that they are doing a decent job. There always seem to be some kind of<BR>
&gt;complaints going on, one persone says there are too many messages, another<BR>
&gt;complains about repetition. Someone even called us &quot;boring&quot; recently, but<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I<BR>
&gt;for one, would be very upset if this list was lost. I find the exchanges<BR>
&gt;stimulating, informative and mostly compassionate and loving.<BR>

Hi,  =<BR>

It seems that most of you on this diet have pretty severe IBD problems.  =<BR>

the diet 6 months and has had just as many flareups as when not on the<BR>
diet...although he recovers much much quicker.  He has been taking dipent=<BR>

and it controls this problem very well(with a few flareups a year where h=<BR>
e<BR>
then takes rowasa short-term).  The dipentum controlled his UC even when<BR>
not on the diet.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently a car accident messed up his back pretty good.  He starting taki=<BR>
ng<BR>
Ultram for the pain which did not do a whole lot.  He finally got off of =<BR>

terrible.  He did not sleep for over 3 days!  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He is trying to bear the pain and is in physical therapy.  I know he hate=<BR>

this diet for the food choices and has lost a lot of needed weight.  I<BR>
guess I am trying to weight the advantages and disadvantages of this diet=<BR>
<BR>
for someone who doesn't have a severe problem in that the medication<BR>
controls it with no apparent side effects.  Are the long terms effects of=<BR>
<BR>
Dipentum so bad that he should stick it out with this diet...or should he=<BR>
<BR>
go back to a regular diet and just really try to limit the non SCD stuff.=<BR>

Hi Lynn,<BR>
I used to take 4 Pentasa a day since May/95.  My new doctor here (I moved<BR>
this year) wanted me to increase it to 8/day if I wanted to do the diet.<BR>
I had lost 10 pounds since January (new job, new city, new house, ...), and<BR>
was having more bloating/pain/BM. He wanted me to start nightly<BR>
tube-feeding,<BR>
but I took this as a major warning sign (another operation) that I would<BR>
now start the SCD diet.<BR>
So, in your case, taking 16/day is up to your doctor and you (and how you<BR>
feel<BR>
about it).  If it is your first time taking it, and depending on the<BR>
severity<BR>
of your symptoms, I would think taking less should be ok (but I dislike<BR>
doctors<BR>
and their attitudes towards drugs).  It's always your choice, doctors<BR>
should<BR>
never be put up on a pedestal.<BR>
The diet is helping me and I have regained 6-8 pounds (all in the last<BR>
three weeks)<BR>
since my first visit with the doctor in May/97.  I have just crossed 12<BR>
weeks on<BR>
the diet, and still not introducing too many foods.  Nut muffins and<BR>
cookies are<BR>
the best, and I also started eating peanut butter (all natural--just<BR>
peanuts).<BR>
All the best and continued good health.<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

&gt; Hi,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; It seems that most of you on this diet have pretty severe IBD<BR>
&gt; problems.  My<BR>
&gt; husband who is on the diet has UC, but usually proctitis.  He has been<BR>
&gt; on<BR>
&gt; the diet 6 months and has had just as many flareups as when not on the<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; diet...although he recovers much much quicker.  He has been taking<BR>
&gt; dipentum<BR>
&gt; and it controls this problem very well(with a few flareups a year<BR>
&gt; where he<BR>
&gt; then takes rowasa short-term).  The dipentum controlled his UC even<BR>
&gt; when not on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
So, my question is:<BR>
<BR>
If there are flare-ups, how can it be said that dipentum is controlling<BR>
the symptoms?<BR>
<BR>
Something to think about...<BR>
<BR>
What you describe seems to be an relatively successful treatment plan.<BR>
To keep the flares under control without prednesone or other big hitters<BR>
is excellent.  In my opinion, you should avoid these drugs at all cost,<BR>
since prednesone is extremely damaging and in the long run will make the<BR>
UC worse by screwing up the intestinal flora balance (again my<BR>
opinion).  Dipentum never seemed to do anything for me, but I am unaware<BR>
of any documented long term side effects, however it is my personal<BR>
belief that it does have negative effects -- it is a foreign substance,<BR>
just like processed foods.<BR>
<BR>
After discontining all maintenence drugs (dipentum, imuran) two years<BR>
ago, my energy went up, without any increase in flareup frequency or<BR>
duration.<BR>
<BR>
Does your husband see a alternative health practitioner?  If he quits<BR>
the diet, what are you going to do next?  The net is not a complete<BR>
resource for health issues, especially for the beginner. You should just<BR>
pay the $20-40 a visit and get some professional advice and all your<BR>
questions answered.  Without my last chiropractor, I would have probably<BR>
had my colon removed by now -- MDs had me that screwed up.  But, I<BR>
needed the personal attention to really begin to understand my body,<BR>
when a symptom was bad, when it was good (headaches and diareaha, for<BR>
example, are not always bad, but natural in the course of treatment).<BR>
<BR>
To stick with the SCD, well, these opinions are forthcoming from others<BR>
I'm sure. If you decided to add foods,  Ithink the most detrimental<BR>
substances to colitis (in this order): all simple sugars, wheat and<BR>
other high gluten grains.   When I eliminated these from my diet, I<BR>
noticed an immediate change in my symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
I'll be happy to answer any more questions on or off-list is you want.<BR>

<BR>
   Sorry, I forgot that chiros are mostly misunderstood by the masses.<BR>
The training has dramatically changed, and I'd say they have a better<BR>
understanding of nutrition and the body than most MDs -- the good<BR>
schools are not for med school drop outs.   Many specialize and receive<BR>
in depth training in herbs, accupunture, chinese medicines, applied<BR>
reflexology, nutrition and others.<BR>
<BR>
There are a lot of bone crackers, but if you find one that specializes<BR>
in the field of your interest (my last was into allergies, accupunture,<BR>
herbals, supplimentation and applied reflexology) your are getting a<BR>
well trained alternative practitioner who can also advise on drugs and<BR>
is trained to read and understand the medical literature.<BR>
<BR>
Sure this guy kept my back in line, which was helpful, but he knew that<BR>
diet, supplimentation and herbs were what was going to get me off drugs<BR>
and healthy.  (And I got off the drugs in 4 months!)<BR>

Dear Ellen,<BR>
I also had a problem with the yogurt when first starting out on the diet.<BR>
I'm thinking that maybe it's better to slowly ease into the yogurt if<BR>
you're having problems with it, especially if you weren't much of a yogurt<BR>
eater before. If that doesn't work, you could always take a break from it<BR>
and test again later. I feel that if cheese and butter are well tolerated,<BR>
there shouldn't be any need to eliminate all dairy. Just my opinion, of<BR>
course.<BR>

&gt; I don't know what other sources there are that are non-dairy.  You could<BR>
&gt; consider acidopholis supplements though.  Personnally, I'm thinking about<BR>
&gt; eliminating the dairy for a couple of weeks and see what difference it<BR>
makes.<BR>
&gt;  I've had a bad reaction to the yogurt 3 times out of 4 lately.  When I<BR>
&gt; ingest it, I quickly get an intensely painful spasming in my lower<BR>
abdomen<BR>
&gt; and within minutes of that I have a round of diarreah.  Nothing else on<BR>
this<BR>
&gt; diet so far seems to bother me.  I'm thinking about getting my calcium<BR>
from<BR>
&gt; other sources (spinach, broccoli, figs, almonds) and skipping the yogurt.<BR>
&gt;  (By the way, I use yogourmet starter and a yogourmet yogurt maker.) <BR>
I've<BR>
&gt; heard that two weeks is a good trial period to see whether eliminating<BR>
dairy<BR>
&gt; (but otherwise staying on the SCD) is helpful so I will probably try that<BR>
and<BR>

There are other sources of &quot;good&quot; bacteria that can balance the flora of<BR>
bacteria in your digestive tract besides yoghurt.  The only one that<BR>
comes to mind right away is saurkraut, if you can eat it!  Actually it's<BR>
not so bad once you get past the first mouthful...  I think I heard<BR>
somewhere (probably from this listserver) that it actually has more<BR>
acidophilous - or it's equivalent - than yoghurt.  I prefer the yoghurt,<BR>
since I'm not dairy-intolerant.<BR>

&gt; &gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; Dear Ellen,<BR>
&gt; I also had a problem with the yogurt when first starting out on the<BR>
&gt; diet.<BR>
&gt; I'm thinking that maybe it's better to slowly ease into the yogurt if<BR>
&gt; you're having problems with it, especially if you weren't much of a<BR>
&gt; yogurt<BR>
&gt; eater before. If that doesn't work, you could always take a break from<BR>
&gt; it<BR>
&gt; and test again later. I feel that if cheese and butter are well<BR>
&gt; tolerated,<BR>
&gt; there shouldn't be any need to eliminate all dairy. Just my opinion,<BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; course.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I don't know what other sources there are that are non-dairy.  You<BR>
&gt; could<BR>
&gt; &gt; consider acidopholis supplements though.  Personnally, I'm thinking<BR>
&gt; about<BR>
&gt; &gt; eliminating the dairy for a couple of weeks and see what difference<BR>
&gt; it<BR>
&gt; makes.<BR>
&gt; &gt;  I've had a bad reaction to the yogurt 3 times out of 4 lately.<BR>
&gt; When I<BR>
&gt; &gt; ingest it, I quickly get an intensely painful spasming in my lower<BR>
&gt; abdomen<BR>
&gt; &gt; and within minutes of that I have a round of diarreah.  Nothing else<BR>
&gt; on<BR>
&gt; this<BR>
&gt; &gt; diet so far seems to bother me.  I'm thinking about getting my<BR>
&gt; calcium<BR>
&gt; from<BR>
&gt; &gt; other sources (spinach, broccoli, figs, almonds) and skipping the<BR>
&gt; yogurt.<BR>
&gt; &gt;  (By the way, I use yogourmet starter and a yogourmet yogurt maker.)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I've<BR>
&gt; &gt; heard that two weeks is a good trial period to see whether<BR>
&gt; eliminating<BR>
&gt; dairy<BR>
&gt; &gt; (but otherwise staying on the SCD) is helpful so I will probably try<BR>
&gt; that<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; &gt; see.<BR>

My favorite recipe for saurkraut:<BR>
<BR>
Wash the saurkraut very, very well.  chop one large onion and add all to<BR>
the crockpot.  Just cover the mixture with chicken broth and add a quarter<BR>
cup of dry white wine.  Sprinkle a little salt and pepper to taste, and<BR>
maybe some of your favorite chicken flavoring seasonings, in moderation.<BR>
Layer pork chops on the top and let it cook all day.  You can substitute<BR>
sausages (only SCD allowable) but those you would add in the last hour.<BR>
Drain and serve.<BR>
<BR>
We have never found anyone who hated saurkraut that did not change their<BR>
mind when they tasted &quot;Ren=E9s Saurkraut&quot;.<BR>
Enjoy,<BR>

I am wondering, Rachel, what medications you are on. I have been on the diet<BR>
for 11 months--in remission for 8--and am on Dipentum, Asacol and 6MP. My<BR>
doctor would like to wean me from everything (I think) but the 6MP. I find<BR>
that I am tired most of the time which I am not sure if I should attribute to<BR>
the 6MP or the lack of certain foods in the diet. Would you happen to know<BR>
anything about this? The last time he lowered my dose of 6MP, I wasn't on the<BR>
diet and the UC flared up again. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks.<BR>

Dear Rose,<BR>
 I was on azulphadine for more than 8 years. I took myself off all meds<BR>
(one pill at a time) about a year and a half ago with no ill effects. I'd<BR>
been totally symptom free for a year at the time. I've also been diagnosed<BR>
with fibromyalgia, and for me I think that thats why I'm tired a lot. I<BR>
also have spondylitis ( a form of arthritis associated with UC) and it<BR>
doesn't let me sleep real well so I'm sure that is also a contributing<BR>
factor. Good luck to you.<BR>

In a message dated 97-09-19 15:50:07 EDT, you write:<BR>

 are permissable the book is pretty vague in this area? &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hmmm.  I see what you mean.  On p.59 it explains that you should not purchase<BR>
and use Dextrose in your own food preparation because purchased Dextrose<BR>
might actually contain a mixture of assorted sugars, but it does not address<BR>
whether it would be okay as a listed ingredient in packaged foods.  Dextrose<BR>
by definition should be a monosaccharide which would imply that it would be<BR>
okay.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not precisely sure what maltodextrin is but Maltose is a disaccharide<BR>
sugar and therefore wouldn't be allowed.  <BR>
<BR>
Hopefully someone who knows more than I can address this question.<BR>

&gt; I believe there are about 200 people on this diet (or at least<BR>
&gt;there are about 200 people calling Hughson's for almond flour for this diet).<BR>
<BR>
Ellen,<BR>
I believe there are way more than 200 people on the diet.  My estimate is in<BR>
the thousands.  If 200 get their flour from that one place, think about how<BR>
many people don't even know about that company, and all over the world too. <BR>
Anyway, I like some of your ideas about how we could get a study done, but<BR>
unfortunately, I think it won't happen in the near future.  It's interesting<BR>
that an HMO did a study on the Zone.  If you hear about any results, please let<BR>
me know. (I'm not on this list anymore).  Thanks,<BR>

Hi All<BR>
<BR>
Last Wednesday night I attended our support group meeting in Fort Wayne.  I have been <BR>
working with people there for a number of years to try to get them to use the diet.<BR>
<BR>
The meeting was what we call a rap session with each in attendence getting a chance to <BR>
tell or talk about something of interest.  I heard a number of people talking about <BR>
their operations and medications.  This is really discouraging to me.  One young lady <BR>
told of facing surgery in the next couple of months.  Her surgeon has given her a choice <BR>
between a resection and having her colon removed.  She has been on the SCD for short <BR>
periods of time but by her own admission, her addiction to sugar has prevented her from <BR>
staying on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
The last couple to speak had driven up from Anderson, Indiana (about a 2 hour drive).  <BR>
The lady told the group of her great success using the SCD and that she and her husband <BR>
were planning to start a SCD group.  She says they have never done anything like that <BR>
before but are going to figure it out and do it.  Pretty neat!<BR>
<BR>
Our November meeting is going to be devoted to the SCD.  The bonus is all the <BR>
refreshments for the meeting will be consistent with the SCD.  By the way, these types <BR>
of refreshments have been a big hit with our group in the past.<BR>

Pine nuts are the edible seeds of a pine tree.  Are they allowed on the SCD?<BR>
 I thought they were listed somewhere in the book, but I can't find the<BR>
reference.<BR>
<BR>
I've been reading a lot of wonderful soup recipes lately that call for 1 cup<BR>
of heavy cream blended in at the end.  Has anyone experimented with<BR>
substituting yogurt made with cream in such a recipe?  Do you need to add a<BR>
bit of honey to take the sharp edge off the yogurt?<BR>

Is there a &quot;Whole Foods&quot; Grocery Store in LA?  In the Bay Area, in Marin<BR>
County, where I live, they are the only grocery store I have found that<BR>
carries the Friendship Farmer's Cheese.  Wild Oats carries one, but it is<BR>
firm like brick or cheddar, although called &quot;Farmer's Cheese&quot; and does not<BR>
resemble the softness or texture of the Friendship, which is recommended in<BR>
the book.  In the book, page 146, there is a resource telephone number for<BR>
California. I called it and was told that number is Domestic Cheese Dairies<BR>
who are a distributor for Friendship Farmer's Cheese.  I asked them who in<BR>
the Bay Area they distribute to and found &quot;Whole Foods&quot; which is very near<BR>
me.  You could call them at 415/ 826-7080 to get this information.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I called the New York State - Friendship Dairies, in Friendship,<BR>
N.Y., page 147 in the book, and talked to Dave Butine re the &quot;cream&quot; that<BR>
is listed as an ingredient.  He said that the cream is added before the<BR>
cheese is &quot;made&quot; and has less than l/2 of 1 percent lactose in it.<BR>
<BR>
I personally find this particular brand of Farmer's Cheese, which I consume<BR>
about 2 pounds/week (mixed with my homemade yogurt for breakfast) and in<BR>
the cottage cheese recipe, which I eat almost daily, to be the most<BR>
comforting two things I eat.  As they go down, my digestive tract feels so<BR>
soothed.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck in finding the Friendship Farmer's Cheese!<BR>

Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, and maybe in southern California as well,<BR>
dry curd cottage cheese is more often called baker's cheese. Also, several<BR>
weeks ago there was a post that gave the name of a store in San Francisco<BR>
that was willing to ship DCCC to customers.<BR>
