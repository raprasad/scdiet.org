<BR>
<BR>&gt;Hi Guys;
<BR>&gt;    I was wondering what role if any, exercise has with IBD.  Since I am a
<BR>&gt;software engineer, I sit in front of a PC all day.  Dont get me wrong, I am
<BR>&gt;not over weight. I just want to know if exercise can help.
<BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt;    I live in Tampa Florida so the weather is really nice this time of year
<BR>&gt;(mostly 80's during the day and high 60's at night).  I also have a heated
<BR>&gt;swimming pool.  Yes you read it right, Floridians refuse to go in water
<BR>that
<BR>&gt;is less than 85.  My pool is currently at 80.  If exercise plays an
<BR>&gt;important role, I will make it a point to swim regularly.
<BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt;Thanks for any info.
<BR>&gt;
<BR>&gt;Ted

<BR>Hi Ted:
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Get those swimming trunks on Ted. I believe that exercise plays a integral
 role in any healthy lifestyle. We who are cursed by the presence of
 computers in our lives are especially at risk.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>I have CD, but I get as much exercise as I can. Although I am not a swimmer
 (I'm a runner), my Mom has recently begun swimming and it has done great
 things for her. You see, being in good shape may not prevent a relapse, but
 a strong healthy body will help you heal faster when you do have one.
 Besides, you'll fell just great.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Good Luck,
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Stan

<BR>Dear Ted,
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Yes exercise plays an important part. I know from my personal experience,
 and I have seen on this forum many others talk about the benefits of regular
 excercise...
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Let us know if it works out for you.
