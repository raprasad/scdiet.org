<BR>
You can test for starch in foods using iodine.  For more information,<BR>
see the following web site:<BR>
<A HREF="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/%7edesign.machine-tanya/irritable.bowel/">
http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~design.machine-tanya/irritable.bowel/</A>  Or<BR>
read the following info, taken from that web site.<BR>
<BR>
Often when I thought I had eliminated every possible source from my<BR>
diet, the dreaded symptoms would return and I would be desperate again.<BR>
There seemed to be no answer to identifying starch in some food, except<BR>
to eat it and suffer. And then my friendly local chemist reminded me of<BR>
the easy test for starch: simply drop iodine onto the suspect food. If<BR>
it contains starch, the colour of the iodine will darken from orange to<BR>
shades ranging from inky blue to black. Needless to say, I tested all<BR>
sorts of food immediately. Flour, bread, cakes, potatoes and rice go a<BR>
very dark blue-black colour - almost like carbon. Raw sliced vegetables<BR>
show signs of starch by going greyish around the edges - where the cell<BR>
wall has been damaged by cutting, I suppose - but it's not enough to<BR>
cause problems. On meat, cheese, butter, eggs and animal products, the<BR>
iodine colour remains unchanged (it may tend to go a little darker as it<BR>
dries). The same is true of most fruits - except bananans, which in<BR>
varying degrees, depending on how ripe they are, turn dark when tested,<BR>
proving they're full of starch.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, I sometimes still discover new sources of starch in<BR>
foods. This is where the iodine starch test is a great help. If the<BR>
starch content in the food is significant enough to cause IBS problems,<BR>
it will show up. There are other methods of testing for starch, but the<BR>
iodine test seems to be very reliable as far as the digestion of starch<BR>
is concerned, and it's easy and quick.<BR>
<BR>
Buy a small bottle of iodine (which costs in the U.K. about 40 to 50<BR>
pence) from your local chemist and an eyedropper. Drop a small amount of<BR>
iodine onto the suspect food, then wait a few minutes to see if the<BR>
iodine changes from its normal orange colour into shades ranging from<BR>
reddish-brown to dark inky-blue or even black. Some foods take longer<BR>
than others to show the starch content. On nutmeg, for instance, it<BR>
takes about 30 minutes before the iodine drop turns almost black.<BR>
<BR>
  It's surprising to discover that some foods which most people believe<BR>
to be basically protein - such as certian varieties of nuts - contain<BR>
high quantities of starch. Ground almonds had never caused me problems,<BR>
so I wasn't surprised when the iodine test showed they contained no<BR>
starch, but walnuts are a different matter - I discovered that the skin<BR>
contains starch, while the meat of the nut does not. Cashew nuts are<BR>
very rich in starch as are chestnuts and sunflower seeds. Peanuts also<BR>
contain starch. Sadly, some of the foods we think of as 'health foods'<BR>
have high starch content.<BR>
<BR>
Even some cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert sometimes have starch in<BR>
their outer white crust, although of course, the main cheese part is<BR>
protein and fat. This is not always the case and may perhaps be because<BR>
potato flour or other starch has been used in the final processing. It's<BR>
always wise to test before eating. If you're unsure about any food, the<BR>
iodine test will help you to identify quickly and easily whether it's<BR>
safe for you to eat.<BR>
<BR>
Recently I have made one further discovery: ordinary sugar, i.e. table<BR>
sugar, caster sugar, brown sugar or raw sugar all of which is processed<BR>
from cane sugar or sugar beet, can cause problems if I eat too much.<BR>
This trouble is compounded if the sugar has been cooked too long or at<BR>
too high a temperature - the scientific term is 'caramelisation'.<BR>
Caramelisation produces digestive resistant starch or RS.<BR>
<BR>
Sugar can be cooked at low temperatures (as in meringues) or dissolved<BR>
in cold solutions, as in cold puddings such as ice cream. It's safer<BR>
eaten in this way, but you can also subsitute fruit sugar in almost<BR>
exactly the same way for most cooking or sweetening. The previous<BR>
chapter in the book 'IBS Starch-Free Diet' explains why.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
Iodine testing can be a fun game, but completely unnecessary if you eat only<BR>
fresh unprocessed foods recommended and allowable on scd. Why are you<BR>
testing these allowable foods?<BR>
<BR>
Breaking the vicious cycle is a &quot;Specific carbohydrate diet&quot;  _Not_ a<BR>
carbohydrate free diet. We are allowed to eat ripe bananas even though they<BR>
have a high starch and sugar content, same with the white beans and walnuts.<BR>
These are okay foods for us to eat.<BR>
<BR>
From you post I could surmise your eating table sugar?  What's that all<BR>
about?<BR>

After reading the web site you indicated I  realized you cut and pasted a<BR>
chapter from this women's book for us to read. I guess your not eating sugar :)<BR>
Her diet doesn't sound right for most of us who suffer from a U colitis or<BR>
Crohns.<BR>
