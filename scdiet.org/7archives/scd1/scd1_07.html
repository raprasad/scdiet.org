&gt;Raw food intolerance - after 2 mos. on the diet, still cannot tolerate raw<BR>
&gt;fruits or veggies.  Wondering about veggie juice?  Like carrot, mixed<BR>
&gt;veggies.  Seems like that would be a great way to get my veggies, as a<BR>
&gt;snack, etc. but would the raw juice have the same effect as raw veggies?<BR>
&gt;Fruit?  I find my body is still too sensitive for oj, apple juice; but<BR>
&gt;grape juice is okay and tomato juice (canned).<BR>
<BR>
I had much better experience with cooked veggies to start than with juiced<BR>
veggies. I also found that the yogurt seemed to help me digest things I had<BR>
not previously been able to eat.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;There has been some improvement and I have been fanatical about sticking to<BR>
&gt;the SCD diet; but I had hoped after I read the book, that things would<BR>
&gt;improve a little faster than they have.<BR>
<BR>
Give it some time. Some people respond more quickly than others, and again<BR>
I found the yogurt to be a great help in my recovery.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Fatigue - Find I have to eat more often than 3x a day as I now have no<BR>
&gt;energy reserves since being on the diet!  Anyone else have this?  I used to<BR>
&gt;be able to go to the gym and have a mild workout, but since being on the<BR>
&gt;diet, have not been once -- have to conserve my energy for work, cooking<BR>
&gt;this diet, etc.<BR>
<BR>
This is a biggie. I also found that eating 3x a day was much too hard on my<BR>
system and I would be totally drained of energy. Eating multiple small<BR>
meals throughout the day was a major and beneficial change for me.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Exercise - what do people are on the diet do?<BR>
<BR>
I swim every day and take martial arts 3x a week. Excersizing does wonders,<BR>
both physically and emotionally.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Weight Loss - I have lost about 10 pounds since being on the diet (2 mos)<BR>
&gt;and my doctor says &quot;no more weight loss!&quot; Down to 112 and 5'3&quot;<BR>
and this is<BR>
&gt;maybe a part of my fatigue.  Maybe my body is still adjusting to change in<BR>
&gt;diet, no exercise, etc.  Has anyone else lost quite a bit of weight with<BR>
&gt;this diet?<BR>
<BR>
Try making your yogurt with 1/2 &amp; 1/2. Its loaded with calories.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have had to start eating fish and chicken...my body is craving it, after<BR>
&gt;25 years of being a vegetarian!<BR>
<BR>
Listen to your body. Its giving you advise on how to sustain it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Lots of good luck,<BR>

Dear Ted,<BR>
Doctors worry about being sued for giving alternative medicine advise. My<BR>
own doctor told me not to go on this diet. After 2 incredible colonoscopies<BR>
which showed my restored health. He just said &quot;please continue whatever you<BR>
are doing. It is obviously working&quot; His staff has told me that he now even<BR>
hesitantly recommends the book. If someone asks him about a &quot;diet&quot; to<BR>
treat<BR>
IBD, he says he has a patient who has had incredible success on this diet<BR>
if they'd like to experiment.<BR>

dear rachel,<BR>
<BR>
thanks for your response, still new to this, since yesterday my son<BR>
had the colonoscopy which confirmed UC, but i am interested in your<BR>
comment that you have had to &quot;incredible&quot; coloscopy's since going on<BR>
the diet, is UC such that the drugs the doctor gives control the symptoms<BR>
but the disease continues it's progress?  and in your case, and others<BR>
who have used this SCD diet, is it such that the doctor can't tell<BR>
(other than scarring perhaps) your colon from a &quot;healthy&quot; colon ?<BR>
<BR>
i feel lucky to have found this diet so early in my son's disease, <BR>
the internet is wonderful.<BR>

Dear Ted,<BR>
I hesitate running my &quot;story&quot; too often for fear of boring those that<BR>
have<BR>
heard it too often but I'm sending it again because I want you to know the<BR>
impact that this diet has had on my life;<BR>
<BR>
 Truly, passing on information on bowel disease is my way of somehow<BR>
&quot;paying back&quot; for my incredible good fortune.<BR>
At the time I was finally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC for short),<BR>
I'd had several years of severe diahrea, but worse was the urgency with<BR>
which I had to reach the nearest bathroom. 8, 10, sometimes 20 times a day.<BR>
My bowel movements became more and more laced with blood until sometimes it<BR>
seemed there was no stool, only mucus and blood (sorry for the graphics).<BR>
About a year before being diagnosed, I went to see a gastroenteroligist who<BR>
couldn't find anything wrong, kind of blew me off with, I should try to<BR>
have less stress in my life. When I finally was diagnosed, heres what<BR>
happened; I've been studying martial arts for about 14 years, and about 10<BR>
years ago, I broke my foot in 2 places. Healing seemed prolonged and<BR>
difficult. When I went to see the orthopedist, he gave me an<BR>
antiinflamitory. Fisrt he asked if I had any stomach problems, I said yes,<BR>
so he gave me a mild one. Next day, my stool is black, which I knew was an<BR>
indication of internal bleeding (high in the GI tract), so I stopped taking<BR>
it right away. The following month when I went back to th Dr., My foot was<BR>
a little better. When he asked if the meds helped, I told him what<BR>
happened. He said that there was probably no reason for concern, but he<BR>
wanted to do a blood count just to sure. PS, he sent me immediately to the<BR>
emergency room, where they placed me in ICU for 10 days and did every<BR>
concievable test from every orafice to find out where all this blood was<BR>
coming from. Seems I had a very dangerously low blood count (below 7, when<BR>
normal is over 12). I really didn't feel all that sick, but the doctors<BR>
were actually making noises about my not making it through the night.(I<BR>
know, this is a very long story) Ok so now I've finally found out what is<BR>
wrong with me. They told me that there was no cure for UC except the<BR>
removal of the colon. Diet would not help and medication would help<BR>
sporadically. They also told me that most people with this disease lose<BR>
thier colon to cancer within 7 years of being diagnosed. Great news, huh? I<BR>
went along for the next 5 years, always diahrea, sometimes bleeding,<BR>
sometimes urgency, and somewhat better than before. About 2 years ago a<BR>
patient where I work (I'm an office manager for a dental office) told me<BR>
about hearing Elaine on a talk show and about her diet. Well of course I<BR>
KNEW that diets don't work for UC. This patient kept bugging me every time<BR>
she came in, wanting to know if I'd tried the diet yet. I finally went out<BR>
and bought the book, but after reading it decided it would probably kill<BR>
me. I hadn't even attempted to digest fruits or veggies for years and this<BR>
diet had a lot of that in it. My cousin called as I was finishing the book<BR>
and so I told her about it. She told me about a friend of hers with Crohns<BR>
who had tried what sounded like the same diet, with major success. I called<BR>
the woman and was floored by both the extent of her illness and her success<BR>
with the diet and so I decided to give it a shot. All I can tell you is<BR>
that it has worked miracles for me. I have to have a yearly colonoscopy<BR>
done. Two years ago (oct), my doctor couldn't believe that it was my colon<BR>
he was looking at. He said it looked like that of a healthy 18 year olds.<BR>
Following my 50th birthday this past Jan., I had another one which was the<BR>
duplicate of the previous one. So that's my story. If you have questions<BR>
about the diet itself, please let me know. Lots of luck!!<BR>
Sincerely, Rachel<BR>

I have just deleted you. But for others wishing to unsubscribe, send in the<BR>
command SIGNOFF SCD and mail it to LISTSERV@MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Incidentally, did you all know that a definition of maelstrom is:<BR>

<BR>
We must have different dictionaries. My Merriam-Webster 7th New Collegiate<BR>
has: 1: a powerful often violent whirlpool sucking in objects within a<BR>
given radius, 2: something resembling a maelstrom in turbulence : turmoil.<BR>
<BR>
The fellows that run the Maelstrom Listserv at St. Johns thought this was a<BR>
good analogy for a listserver that was sucking in mail and sending it back<BR>
out. It has some 600 mailing lists with plenty of activity.<BR>

Hi Prateeksha,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Food intolerance - Finding I am still quite limited in vegetables I can<BR>
&gt; tolerate.  I get diarrhea with eggplant; cramping with green beans, peas,<BR>
&gt; asparagus.  Cannot combine protein with fruits; have to eat fruits alone<BR>
&gt; and even then, get gas and sometimes cramping.  Does this change?<BR>
<BR>
When I was on a previous diet a few years ago (not SCD), I was told to<BR>
eat fruits in-between meals.  I believe my ND said that fruit will start<BR>
to ferment in the stomach.  So when it sits on top of other foods, like<BR>
proteins, this can lead to gas and mal-absorption.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Fatigue - Find I have to eat more often than 3x a day as I now have no<BR>
&gt; energy reserves since being on the diet!  Anyone else have this?  I used to<BR>
&gt; be able to go to the gym and have a mild workout, but since being on the<BR>
&gt; diet, have not been once -- have to conserve my energy for work, cooking<BR>
&gt; this diet, etc.<BR>
<BR>
I have been on for about two months also.  My energy is better and once<BR>
the diet kicks in more, I know (from experience) that I will start to <BR>
feel like doing exercise, and thus gain some weight.  For now you should<BR>
let your body use its energy for proper digestion.<BR>
 <BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Prateeksha!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Side effects of either irritable bowel syndrome or ulcerative colitis - two<BR>
&gt; doctors have given different diagnosis!  Vertigo; <BR>
<BR>
I've had the vertigo.  No fun!  As with everything else, mine improves<BR>
as my gut heals more and more.  That one takes patience.  Sometime even<BR>
when I'm not getting diarhea from a food, some still make me more tired<BR>
than others.  Do others find this as well?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Raw food intolerance - after 2 mos. on the diet, still cannot tolerate raw<BR>
&gt; fruits or veggies.  Wondering about veggie juice?  Like carrot, mixed<BR>
&gt; veggies. (snip) Fruit?  <BR>
<BR>
I believe that cooked stuff will be easier to tolerate.  Don't rush it<BR>
if you think something will bother you.  I find it easier to introduce<BR>
something new when I am feeling good and strong.  It's better to wait<BR>
and feel healthy than have variety to eat but feel bad! (another humble<BR>
opinion of mine!)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Food intolerance - Finding I am still quite limited in vegetables I can<BR>
&gt; tolerate.  I get diarrhea with eggplant; cramping with green beans, peas,<BR>
&gt; asparagus.  Cannot combine protein with fruits; have to eat fruits alone<BR>
&gt; and even then, get gas and sometimes cramping.  Does this change?<BR>
<BR>
In my experience, it does change, will change.  Has for me.  For<BR>
example, I can eat apples now.  But peaches and figs make me feel tired<BR>
and spacey.  Haven't tried bananas.  Almonds bother me but not pecans or<BR>
cashews.  Go figure!  :)  But in the beginning, I couldn't eat apples.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Fatigue - Find I have to eat more often than 3x a day as I now have no<BR>
&gt; energy reserves since being on the diet!  Anyone else have this?  I used to<BR>
&gt; be able to go to the gym and have a mild workout, but since being on the<BR>
&gt; diet, have not been once -- have to conserve my energy for work, cooking<BR>
&gt; this diet, etc.<BR>
<BR>
I felt like that during the first few months of the diet.  It can be<BR>
different things (of course) but first and foremost is that it takes a<BR>
lot more calories to heal the body than to just maintain it.  So make<BR>
sure you really are getting enough food for yourself.  When I first<BR>
started the diet I found I could eat four times as much as I did<BR>
before.  In fact, if I didn't, I felt like I was starving. I'd be<BR>
curious about other's experience with this one.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Exercise - what do people are on the diet do?<BR>
<BR>
For me, I just stick to walks.  Sometimes fast, sometimes slow.  But<BR>
walking is what I do most consistentley.  I used to run, practice<BR>
martial arts, yoga, cycling.  But now I am happy to have the energy to<BR>
just get through the day.  I find that my energy level stays pretty<BR>
consistent, will go donw if I've eat something that irrititates my gut<BR>
or if I've eaten too much.  This one does get better!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Weight Loss - I have lost about 10 pounds since being on the diet (2 mos)<BR>
&gt; and my doctor says &quot;no more weight loss!&quot; Down to 112 and<BR>
5'3&quot; and this is<BR>
&gt; maybe a part of my fatigue.  Maybe my body is still adjusting to change in<BR>
&gt; diet, no exercise, etc.  Has anyone else lost quite a bit of weight with<BR>
&gt; this diet?<BR>
<BR>
I lost weight but then it leveled out again.  Try to eat,eat, eat!  Eat<BR>
higher calorie foods like avocado if you can handle it.  Eat the skin of<BR>
the chicken, etc.  It takes practice, but you can get enough calories on<BR>
this diet, so don't think weight loss is a given.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I have had to start eating fish and chicken...my body is craving it, after<BR>
&gt; 25 years of being a vegetarian!<BR>
<BR>
I had that too.  It wasn't that I was a vegetarian, but, man, can I pack<BR>
the protein foods away these days!  I figure my body is craving them for<BR>
a reason, most likely repair of damaged tissue (yay!).<BR>
<BR>
Regarding Progesterone, I for one was on natural progesterone for two<BR>
years!  So I have a little understanding of it.  Out of curiosity, which<BR>
pharmacy produces the natural progesterone you are on?  Mine was<BR>
ApotheCure out of Dallas, Texas.  (I could give you their phone number<BR>
if you want it.)  I used to take capsules, then switched to a sublingual<BR>
(under the tongue) liquid.  By the way, I am off of it now, weened<BR>
myself off slowly since last November and stopped this June.  My need<BR>
for it decreased as my gut healed.  <BR>
<BR>
I don't know about the starch in it, but perhaps you could get a<BR>
sublingual liquid like I did.  I am fairly sure there is no starch in<BR>
it.  However, regarding the wild yam extract -- I personally would not<BR>
worry about the starch factor as it is doubtful that any remains.  They<BR>
must break it down to the actual chemicals of progesterone so it is no<BR>
longer &quot;starch.&quot;  But the filler they use in the capsules, I'm not sure<BR>
about that.  Anyway, for what it's worth, those are my humble opinions<BR>
on the progesterone!<BR>
<BR>
I did not notice an aggravation in symptoms while I was on the<BR>
progesterone.  But everyone is different.<BR>
<BR>
Hope these experiences of mine as well as the humble opinions help you<BR>
out.  Don't be afraid of asking too many questions.  This is the place<BR>
for them!  Glad you made it to the list!  <BR>

Additionally they are reducing the price by .25 cents per pound for those<BR>

please mention this when you call.<BR>
If you are in a rush they will send through other carriers but it will cost<BR>

	Hi folks. Now that I seem to back to normal and still following the diet<BR>
to the letter, I have one question for the group. My symptoms have<BR>
completely subsided and I have dropped down to a much more realistic<BR>
weight. The one problem I am having is a loss of energy and strength during<BR>
the day. I am presently doing some carpentry, and some days I feel out of<BR>
gas and my muscles just get weak.<BR>
	 I believe that carbohydrates are turned into sugars in our bodies and<BR>
that is what supplies the fuel. What might be good for replacement?<BR>
	I am wondering if others feel this way, and if there are certain foods<BR>
that might be recomended to keep up my strength , I can eat most anything<BR>
allowed, but not too much fruit all day. Lunch is a bit of a problem as I<BR>
bring it with me and can't really prepare a meal as it were.  Iam eating<BR>
eggs with tomatoes ,cheese, mushrooms or whatever for breakfast along with<BR>
the deliciouse 1/2 and 1/2 yogurt.  It is not really  convenient to eat<BR>
many small meals, but that may be the answer.<BR>
	 Got any suggestions? Thanx...Bill<BR>

Every teenager must be different.  My son was eighteen when he started the<BR>
diet, and he had been urging me to research for some diet that would help<BR>
him.  He was sick enough that he wanted relief.   Perhaps your son would<BR>
agree to try the diet for one month.  He may find he feels so much better<BR>
that he will want to continue.<BR>

Bill, I'm curious, does your energy pick up when you eat, or go down? <BR>
Sometimes mine goes down.  I find that certain foods are harder for me<BR>
to digest, or irritate my digestive system, even though I may not get<BR>
diarrhea.  I ate a peach recently and got soooo tired.  I too am curious<BR>
about other's response to your post.  Hopefully this improves over<BR>
time.  I do notice that, in general, my energy is more consistent now,<BR>
on month six, than it was at, say, month two.  That's encouraging.<BR>

We tried chestnut flour when we first put our son on the diet. We couldn't<BR>
find almond flour locally at first and we did find chestnut at the health<BR>
food store.<BR>
It is allowed, but it didnn't taste very good at all. We made 1 batch of<BR>
muffins with it. My son ate them, but he hadn't had any bread or cake for a<BR>
while, and would have eaten anything that looked like muffins. My wife and<BR>
I threw ours away when lunch time rolled around. We all like the breads and<BR>
muffins we make with almond flour though.<BR>

Hi Denise and Prateeksha (and the rest of you, of course).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; Fatigue - Find I have to eat more often than 3x a day as I now have no<BR>
&gt; &gt; energy reserves since being on the diet!  Anyone else have this?  I<BR>
used to<BR>
&gt; &gt; be able to go to the gym and have a mild workout, but since being on<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; &gt; diet, have not been once -- have to conserve my energy for work,<BR>
cooking<BR>
&gt; &gt; this diet, etc.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I felt like that during the first few months of the diet.  It can be<BR>
&gt; different things (of course) but first and foremost is that it takes a<BR>
&gt; lot more calories to heal the body than to just maintain it.  So make<BR>
&gt; sure you really are getting enough food for yourself.  When I first<BR>
&gt; started the diet I found I could eat four times as much as I did<BR>
&gt; before.  In fact, if I didn't, I felt like I was starving. I'd be<BR>
&gt; curious about other's experience with this one.<BR>
<BR>
I felt like that too, but only during the introduction of the diet.<BR>
During that<BR>
time, I often felt that my blood sugar got really low (shaky hands,<BR>
headaches and<BR>
so on). After that time, I noticed that both my appetite and energy were<BR>
rising.<BR>
Now, after only three weeks on the diet, I have to bring a truckload of<BR>
bananas,<BR>
apples, pears, carrots, tomatos etc. to work to eat between meals. I<BR>
guess I eat<BR>
3-4 lbs. of these at work. I think this gets quite expensive (here in<BR>
Sweden,<BR>
the average fruit/veggie prize is about one dollar/lbs), but it shure is<BR>
worth it.<BR>
In spite of my in-between meals, I'm still hungry when I get home from<BR>
work.<BR>
It may sound a bit funny, but I think it feels great to be hungry,<BR>
because I<BR>
haven't been that since I got my CD in -84, I only ate because I knew I<BR>
had to.<BR>
My friends can't understand that I never got hungry, but I guess it's<BR>
hard to<BR>
explain that to people who haven't been in that situation.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards<BR>
<BR>

Hi Bill.<BR>
<BR>
I recommend you to try to increase your fat intake. Aside from single<BR>
sugars<BR>
(from honey, fruits etc.), that is the kind of calories that is easiest<BR>
for<BR>
your body to convert into pure energy.<BR>
You say that your muscles get weak. Do you get enough protein? You need<BR>
that<BR>
to build up and maintain your muscles, otherwise they will deteriorate<BR>
and,<BR>
of course, get weak.<BR>
<BR>
I have to bring my own lunch to work too. I usually prepare some kind of<BR>
salad<BR>
(tuna, shrimp or something like that) for that purpose, and have my<BR>
meat-meal<BR>
when I get home. I also bring a load of fruit to eat between meals.<BR>
You say you can't eat too much fruit, but how about the muffins? They<BR>
contain<BR>
a lot of energy since nuts contain more than 50% fat. In the book, I<BR>
know Elaine<BR>
says that you shouldn't eat more than four muffins a day on the expense<BR>
of other<BR>
foods, but I usually eat six of them at work, and another two or three<BR>
in the<BR>
evening. I don't give up other foods because of that since I'm more or<BR>
less<BR>
hungry all the time. Before I started the diet three weeks ago, I<BR>
haven't been<BR>
hungry since I got my CD thirteen years ago so, for me, this hunger<BR>
sensation<BR>
just feels great!<BR>
<BR>
I hope this answer can help you.<BR>

Hi Bill,<BR>
<BR>
I know what you mean - I'm having trouble getting a lot of small meals<BR>
at work, too.<BR>
<BR>
But I've found a solution that works for me :<BR>
<BR>
1. Nuts - all kinds of nuts. Cashews (my favorite at the moment),<BR>
almonds, pecans, hazelnuts (I think you call them philberts) or whatever<BR>
catches my fancy when I'm shopping.<BR>
<BR>
2. Allowable dates.<BR>
<BR>
I can bring a bag full where ever I go and it's easy to grab a handfull<BR>
when I feel the need. A handfull of nuts and a few dates, and I'm good<BR>
for another hour and a half or so.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you find your energy soon.<BR>

Man, you seem to eat a LOT!!!  I feel guilty eating that much, although<BR>
I WANT to.  My wife thinks I'm a bit of a pig, although I only weith 150<BR>
lbs and am 6 feet tall!  I feel pretty good.  I've come to believe that<BR>
my &quot;hunger&quot; is simply been bored on the job (I'm a financial ho-hum<BR>
analyst in a non-profit environment).  Maybe I'm really supposed to be<BR>
eating more to compensate for the lack of complex carbos.  Yet, on the<BR>
other hand, I believe that eating all the time too much will inhibit my<BR>
digestion and work against the diet...<BR>

In a message dated 97-08-14 08:08:55 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Try making your yogurt with 1/2 &amp; 1/2. Its loaded with calories.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
You could add fat calories and still lose weight if you are not eating enough<BR>
carbohydrates.  The body requires carbohydrates to metabolize the fat one<BR>
eats into energy and store the remainder.  With insufficient carbohydrates,<BR>
the bodyfat is used for energy causing one to lose weight regardless of the<BR>
amount of fat in the diet.  The honey in the diet provides carbohydrates and<BR>
other foods on the diet may be good sources as well (the beans, for example).<BR>
 If, for some reason, you are avoiding or eating very little of the allowed<BR>
carbohydrates on the diet this could account for the weight loss.  Make sure<BR>
you are getting sufficient carbohydrates as you increase the fat content as<BR>
suggested above.  This should halt the weight loss.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps others who are more versed in nutrition can suggest some strong<BR>
sources of carbohydrates allowable on the diet and tolerable for you if you<BR>
cannot eat the honey.<BR>

Yeah, I too think I eat a lot, but I guess it's because<BR>
I never got hungry before I got on the diet. Of course,<BR>
I can get rather bored on my job as well (I'm a test<BR>
engineer), but that's not the reason, since I didn't<BR>
eat anything between meals before I started the diet.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure about my weight, I can't check it on a daily<BR>
basis, since I don't have a scale, but I think it was<BR>
about 125 lbs before I started the diet (I'm 5'8&quot;) and I<BR>
guess my &quot;ideal&quot; weight is somewhere around 140 lbs. I<BR>
know that I have gained a few of these already.<BR>
<BR>
I think that as long as you don't &quot;press&quot; down your food,<BR>
it won't harm your digestion. At least I haven't noticed<BR>
any signs of that, I just feel GREAT!<BR>
<BR>
I guess that if I go over 140 lbs I have to think a bit<BR>
about how much I eat. Perhaps my hunger will settle when<BR>
I get there, but right now I think it's because of the,<BR>
for me, new sensation called hunger.<BR>

Hi Matt,<BR>
<BR>
You know one of the really great things about the SCD ?<BR>
<BR>
I can eat as much as I want of things that are usually frowned apon<BR>
(mayo, meat, butter(!), nuts, eggs.... I could go on !) and I'm STILL<BR>
loosing weight.<BR>
<BR>
I've been over weight for years, but since I started the diet 3 months<BR>
ago, I've lost 20 pounds. And I'm still loosing about 1 pound per<BR>
fortnight. <BR>
<BR>
I just had a delicious tuna salad for lunch and now I'm going to eat two<BR>
squares of banana cake with DCCC frosting for desert. Yum !<BR>
<BR>
In a couple of hours I'll probably be hungry again and have a handfull<BR>
of cashews and 3 or 4 dates.<BR>
<BR>
Dont ask my how this works - to me it's just magik. And I'm enjoying it<BR>
immensly !<BR>
<BR>
Kris, from Denmark.<BR>
<BR>
P.S.<BR>
<BR>
Talking about the Banana cake reminded me of the Carrot cake recipe - It<BR>
says that one can make carrot pudding by leaving out some of the nut<BR>
flour - has anyone tried that ? Does it taste? <BR>

&gt; Man, you seem to eat a LOT!!!  I feel guilty eating that much, although<BR>
&gt; I WANT to.  My wife thinks I'm a bit of a pig, although I only weith 150<BR>
&gt; lbs and am 6 feet tall!  I feel pretty good.  I've come to believe that<BR>
&gt; my &quot;hunger&quot; is simply been bored on the job (I'm a financial<BR>
ho-hum<BR>
&gt; analyst in a non-profit environment).  Maybe I'm really supposed to be<BR>
&gt; eating more to compensate for the lack of complex carbos.  Yet, on the<BR>
&gt; other hand, I believe that eating all the time too much will inhibit my<BR>
&gt; digestion and work against the diet...<BR>

Hi Denise,<BR>
<BR>
You wrote... &lt;snip&gt;<BR>
&gt; When I first started the diet I found I could eat four times as<BR>
&gt; much as I did before.  In fact, if I didn't, I felt like I was<BR>
&gt; starving. I'd be curious about other's experience with this one.<BR>
<BR>
Increase in appetite is a definite *side-effect* of any diet<BR>
like SCD.  The increase shows that (IMHO) your stomach size increases<BR>
to accept more food coming in, since everything is so easy to digest.<BR>
In a previous diet I was on, this was certainly true as much as<BR>
being on the SCD now.  At that time I was able to eat a whole <BR>
chicken, piles of mashed potatoes, and veggies all in one sitting.<BR>
<BR>
Rignt now I tell others that I can eat like a pig (allowable SCD<BR>
foods of course), and not gain weight (although I really want to).<BR>
<BR>
In any case, I find 3 meals and 3 snacks per day works well.  By<BR>
experimenting, meals include one of hamburger/fish/chicken (eaten<BR>
first for better digestion by stomach acid), soup, cheesecake,<BR>
veggie.  Snacks include 1/4 cup yogurt muffin, cookies, and jello<BR>
(grape gelatin). I try to avoid drinking water during meals in<BR>
order not to dilute stomach acid, only taking as much as required<BR>
to take my pills/vitamins.  Most vitamins are taken after meals<BR>
so that they sit on top and have time to break down properly.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps someone.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

<BR>
Dear Fellow SCDer's,<BR>
My experience was I was always hungry BEFORE I went on the diet. After<BR>
starting the SCD I felt I had a better feel for when I had had enough. For<BR>
me, the starch had an addictive quality to it. I can eat 2 almond flour<BR>
cookies now and feel satisfied, but back in the old days I'd probably just<BR>
be getting started with 2 really good homemade chocolate chip cookies. Same<BR>
story with something like pizza. I always felt I would have liked to have<BR>
had some more. The way I look at things is, what we are eating is REAL<BR>
food. Most of the stuff we had to give up didn't have much nutritional<BR>
value anyway. A couple of years ago, I remember Elaine saying that people<BR>
now are eating like peasants, filling up on starch. Cheap filler. <BR>
Speaking from personal experience, I believe that once you get past the<BR>
starch addiction, your body and mind will thrive on the diet. <BR>
Lucy<BR>
PS. My husband who's about 90% on the diet and doesn't have to be, says<BR>
even his taste for &quot;bad&quot; food has changed.  <BR>

The pharmacist gave me some newly formulated lactose free &quot;asacol&quot; to<BR>
replace<BR>
the plain gelcaps he gave me last weekend. They're not the real thing, which<BR>
as John said are designed to break down in the ph of the end of the small<BR>
intestine and beginning of the large. However, he and my doctor both think <BR>
they will work. The charge for the first month's supply was the same as they<BR>
originally quoted me, about $10 cheaper than Asacol. However, because of the<BR>
extra labor, subsequent prescriptions will be about 15% more than Asacol.<BR>
<BR>
I talked to the pharmacist about Proctor and Gamble's stupidity in making<BR>
pills that contain lactose for people with IBD. He agreed. However, he did<BR>
say that for them to now change the formula in any way would, because of current<BR>
FDA regulations, take years and cost millions of dollars. So I'm not going<BR>
to hold my breath.<BR>

<BR>
Hello everyone...<BR>
<BR>
Before reading Elaine's book, I was taking &quot;Whey to go&quot;, a whey protein<BR>
powder that is lactose free, no added sugars, no artificial sweeteners; and<BR>
is enriched with free-form l-glutamine and branched chain amino acids. The<BR>
label states that there is 1g carbohydrate (from the vanilla bean<BR>
flavoring) and 17g protein and 1g sugars (no fructose or sucrose) in one<BR>
scoop (abt. 2 Tbsp.).  What is Elaine's objection to &quot;whey&quot; and do you<BR>
think this would be okay to take as a supplement that would possibly help<BR>
the looooooow energy/fatigue syndrome I am having?<BR>
<BR>
I have not taken it since starting the diet, but it sits there in the<BR>
cabinet, inviting me, each time I open the door!  Comments, please.<BR>
<BR>
Called Life Plus re colodyne and these are the ingredients:<BR>
<BR>
salivarius, lactobaccilis, acidolophus, bifidus, microflora bacteria, made<BR>
with psyllium seed, flax seed, marine algaenate, guar gum, beet root,<BR>
bentonite, black walnut leaves, acidolphus culture and mennitol.  This is<BR>
sold as a colon cleanser.<BR>
<BR>
My chiro recommends another one:  Nature's Biotics, from Life Science<BR>
Products, Inc. in St. George, Utah, 1-800-713-3888 to order and<BR>
1-801-628-4111 for product info, speak to David Dodart.<BR>
<BR>
He says this is fabulous for colon problems; has no fillers, no salt,<BR>
carbs/sugars. Has minerals/trace elements and will give better nutrient<BR>
absorption and therefore, result in higher energy which some of us are<BR>
struggling with.He says to start out with, taken only 1/2 or 1/4 capsule<BR>
and follow directions on bottle then slowly increase the dosage.<BR>
<BR>
Ingredients:  lactobacillus, acidophilus, bifidobacterium Bifidium,<BR>
Bacillus Licheniformis, Bacillus Subtillis, Lactobacills Lactis,<BR>
Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, in a host medium of minerals and trace elements.<BR>
<BR>
QUESTION:  I don't know enough about the ingredients of these two colon<BR>
cleansers to know which would be best for me and others on the SCD.  Does<BR>
anyone have any ideas about this?<BR>
<BR>
Would appreciate response on these 3 items:  Whey to Go, by Solgar; Nature<BR>
Biotics; and Colodyne.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Prateeksha<BR>

All,<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps there are some who can relate to the following problem and offer us<BR>
some insight and hopefully the benefit of similar situations.<BR>
<BR>
Our daughter (20) has been faithful (and fanatically devoted) to the diet<BR>
for 19 months (12 months with meds, Salofalk and Prednisone -20mg).  She is<BR>
diagnosed as having Crohns Colitis - Crohns of the colon.  In that time her<BR>
weight has continued to increase, she exercises and her bloodwork is<BR>
returning to normal.  She does not eat any raw fruit and can tolerate some<BR>
cooked fruits.  She eats much of the rest of the diet including nutbreads,<BR>
pizza, meats and cheese/yougurt.  In the spring and early summer she had a<BR>
colonoscopy and she has no disease in her small intestine, her ileum is free<BR>
of disease and there is superficial disease in the ascending, transverse and<BR>
decending colon.  There is some disease activity in the last 6 inches<BR>
involving the sigmoid and the rectum.  The problem she faces is one of<BR>
urgency.  This has continued to plague her despite the lack of other symtoms<BR>
that bothered her in the past.  As such, she is very uneasy about getting<BR>
out, going places and becomes anxious on the days when thing loosen up.  She<BR>
has not had any formed BM, some days are better than others and there is<BR>
occasional thickening of the stools - but there are still loose.  We<BR>
recieved a good suggestion to keep a diary and note things.<BR>
<BR>
Has anybody gone through the same?  Did you notice any particular trend or<BR>
pattern? Did anything make the urgency better or worse?  How long did it<BR>
last? and  what other things did you notice.<BR>
<BR>
This is an extremely trialsome time - the urgency is making her a prisoner<BR>
in her own home.  Help would be appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
thanks in advance,<BR>

Hi Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
This recipe appeared in the paper yesterday and I tried it<BR>
today...wonderful.  I added pieces of left-over chicken when I added the<BR>
yogurt.<BR>
<BR>
Zucchini Soup with Cinnamon, Cumin and Yogurt<BR>
<BR>
1 pound trimmed zucchini<BR>
3 cups or so chicken stock<BR>
1 tbsp. butter<BR>
2/3 cup chopped onion<BR>
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<BR>
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<BR>
1/2 cup homemade yogurt<BR>
minced fresh cilentro (I used dried)<BR>
salt to taste<BR>
lime or lemon wedges if served cold<BR>
<BR>
Chop zucchini in large chunks and put in small soup pot.  Add chicken<BR>
broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer, covered, about 10 minutes<BR>
(until zucchini are very tender.)<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, heat butter in a small, non-stick frying pan. Add onion, cumin<BR>
and cinnamon, and saute until onion is soft and spices are fragrant.<BR>
<BR>
Put both mixtures into a food processor or blender.  Puree until smooth,<BR>
but do not sieve.  Add yogurt (and chicken, if desired).  Serve hot or<BR>
chilled, sprinkled with cilentro, if use fresh.  If use dried, put in with<BR>
cumin and cinnamon when sauteeing onion.  May wait to add salt at table,<BR>
individually.<BR>
<BR>
Serves 4 as a first course, or 2 as an entree.<BR>
<BR>
Bon appitit!<BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;Hello everyone...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Before reading Elaine's book, I was taking &quot;Whey to go&quot;, a whey<BR>
protein<BR>
&gt;powder that is lactose free, no added sugars, no artificial sweeteners; and<BR>
&gt;is enriched with free-form l-glutamine and branched chain amino acids. The<BR>
&gt;label states that there is 1g carbohydrate (from the vanilla bean<BR>
&gt;flavoring) and 17g protein and 1g sugars (no fructose or sucrose) in one<BR>
&gt;scoop (abt. 2 Tbsp.).  What is Elaine's objection to &quot;whey&quot; and do<BR>
you<BR>
&gt;think this would be okay to take as a supplement that would possibly help<BR>
&gt;the looooooow energy/fatigue syndrome I am having?<BR>
<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
I would be very surprised if a deconstructed and enriched mild product<BR>
would give enery to you. I feel that the barley green or marine algae or<BR>
spirulina would be a better bet.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Called Life Plus re colodyne and these are the ingredients:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;salivarius, lactobaccilis, acidolophus, bifidus, microflora bacteria, made<BR>
&gt;with psyllium seed, flax seed, marine algaenate, guar gum, beet root,<BR>
&gt;bentonite, black walnut leaves, acidolphus culture and mennitol.  This is<BR>
&gt;sold as a colon cleanser.<BR>
<BR>
SS:<BR>
The above looks very good however I would check the 'mannitol' (sp). What<BR>
is it? Also, marine alginate is marine algae. Elaine says no marine algae<BR>
but only because carageenan is not allowed and she feels people would be<BR>
confused and so she restricts all marine algae. Bentonite is a volcanic ash<BR>
and helps pull out toxic metals and minerals etc however if inflammation<BR>
exists I don't know if it would be caustic. However it is also an antidote<BR>
for many intestinal poisons.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;My chiro recommends another one:  Nature's Biotics, from Life Science<BR>
&gt;Products, Inc. in St. George, Utah, 1-800-713-3888 to order and<BR>
&gt;1-801-628-4111 for product info, speak to David Dodart.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;He says this is fabulous for colon problems; has no fillers, no salt,<BR>
&gt;carbs/sugars. Has minerals/trace elements and will give better nutrient<BR>
&gt;absorption and therefore, result in higher energy which some of us are<BR>
&gt;struggling with.He says to start out with, taken only 1/2 or 1/4 capsule<BR>
&gt;and follow directions on bottle then slowly increase the dosage.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Ingredients:  lactobacillus, acidophilus, bifidobacterium Bifidium,<BR>
&gt;Bacillus Licheniformis, Bacillus Subtillis, Lactobacills Lactis,<BR>
&gt;Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, in a host medium of minerals and trace elements.<BR>
<BR>
SS:<BR>
This one sounds the safest to me. However it doesn't having the cleansing<BR>
properties of the 2nd one ie guar gum, psyllium etc.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;QUESTION:  I don't know enough about the ingredients of these two colon<BR>
&gt;cleansers to know which would be best for me and others on the SCD.  Does<BR>
&gt;anyone have any ideas about this?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Would appreciate response on these 3 items:  Whey to Go, by Solgar; Nature<BR>
&gt;Biotics; and Colodyne.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks, Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Hi All<BR>
<BR>
Before I started the diet I ate hip powder (dried and crush fruit of the<BR>
Wild rose). It gives a lot of vitamin C.<BR>
Now I would like too eat it again, but is it allowed in the SCD diet?<BR>
It is all the seeds I am worried about.<BR>

Dear Svend-Aage,<BR>
The acidophilus Elaine recommends is Natren's Healthy Trinity (probiotics=<BR>
).<BR>
She says to make sure you get the lactose base. Often the naturopaths who<BR>
are working with the diet will recommend the oligosaccharide base or some<BR>
other non dairy base. She strongly advises not taking them.<BR>
If your health food store doesn't carry Natren, their phone # is (800)<BR>
992-3323 ext 123.<BR>
Let us know how you do with it.<BR>

If you want to try acidopholus, go to some local health food stores and ask if<BR>
they have any in the refrigerated section.  The refrigerated brands are likely<BR>
to be of better quality than the ones on the shelves.  It should be kept<BR>
refrigerated at all times or the bacteria are likely going to be inactive. <BR>
Read the ingredients and find one with no sugar unless it's dextrose or<BR>
glucose, and no other non-allowable additives.<BR>

About the rosehip powder; I would save it for later when your symptoms are much<BR>
improved.  Too much vitamin C can cause diarrhea and anything acidic can<BR>
irritate our guts as well.  As for it being allowed or not on the SCD, I<BR>
believe it should be OK as it is like an herb or flower and I don't think it<BR>
has starch.  A little rosehip tea is probably ok, but watch how much acidy<BR>
things you are taking in because they can be irritating.  These are just my<BR>
opinions.<BR>

I tried your recipe for the cookies on the weekend.  They were excellent! <BR>
Reminds me of oatmeal cookies.  I used additive free dried bing cherries<BR>
chopped up instead of raisins.  This is the first cookie recipe I've tried<BR>
since going on the SCD and now I'm going to try some of the others in the book.<BR>
 <BR>
Can anyone tell me which ones they have tried in the book and what their<BR>

Greetings all,<BR>
<BR>
More on the Asacol debate:- My pharmacist checked with Novopharm Limited <BR>
who do a generic Asacol that apparently has no lactose. It is called <BR>
NOVO-5 ASA. The following is a list of ingredients taken from a fax from <BR>
the company.<BR>
<BR>
	5-AMINOSALICYLIC ACID<BR>
	CARNUBA WAX POWDER (#1-YELLOW)<BR>
	CHROMA-TERIC T-3199-BRE<BR>
	DRI KLEAR C42<BR>
	EUDRAGIT L-30-D<BR>
	EUDRAGIT L-100-55<BR>
	SOD STARCH GLYCOLATE (EXPLOTAB/PRIMOJEL)<BR>
	MAGNESIUM STEARATE NF<BR>
	MANNITOL BP GRANULAR<BR>
	(PLASODONE) POVIDONE K USP<BR>
	PURIFIED WATER USP<BR>
<BR>
Maybe someone out there with a some knowledge on the subject can surmise <BR>
if this is a suitable composition. It is quite a bit cheaper also.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

I wondered the same thing, but I was pleasantly surprised at the terrific <BR>
results. :)<BR>
<BR>
I ground the almond flour as thin as I could, and dropped the cookie <BR>
dough on the buttered cookie sheet in rounded teaspoonfuls. The cookies <BR>
did expand on the cookie sheet, and came out thinner than a traditional <BR>
peanut butter cookie, but they held together just fine. They became a <BR>
nice golden-brown around the edges. They are moist, with a wonderful <BR>
peanut-buttery texture; different from the other cookie recipes I've <BR>
tried so far. You don't really notice the almond flour in the end result, <BR>
except for an occasional crunchy spot with any larger pieces of almonds.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this info helps, :)<BR>

Thank you for your info about acidopholus, but I don&yen;t understand it has to<BR>
be lactose based. I was sure we have to avoid everything with lactose, and<BR>
that is why we have to make homemade yogurt.<BR>

Just a note about the peanut butter cookies:<BR>
Peanuts are generally difficult for anyone to digest, so if you get<BR>
yourself addicted to the peanut butter cookies, you may start to<BR>
experience problems like gas, etc...<BR>
Eat with moderation!<BR>

Dear Anna,<BR>
Glad you liked the cookies. Here is my version of the peanut butter cookie:<BR>
cut the butter in half and add 1/3 cup almond flour. If you are using<BR>
unsalted peanut butter add 1/3 tsp salt. If you find that the bottoms are<BR>
burning, cook longer at a lower heat.<BR>

Hi all!<BR>
<BR>
I am still confused about how to make yogurt with half and half instead =<BR>
of milk.  I tried it once using 2 cups of half and half and 1/2 cup of =<BR>
starter (I use regular yogurt for starter).  It came out really gritty =<BR>
and runny.  I think my starter had been in the fridge for awhile.=20<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, my question is:  if I use 4 cups of half and half, how much =<BR>
starter do I use?  1/4 cup as with milk or 1 cup based on the french =<BR>
cream recipe in the book?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Carla<BR>
P.S.  I love the peanut butter cookies!  I don't use any nut flour, just =<BR>
P.B, butter, honey, eggs, baking soda and vanilla.=20<BR>

The acidophillus doesn't have to be lactose based.  The book advised<BR>
against  taking supplements containing FOS (fructo-oligo saccharides<BR>
sp?).  It went on to say that given the choice between supplements<BR>
(such as acidophillus) that contain FOS or supplements that contain<BR>
lactose, choose the lactose (&quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;). <BR>
 However, it be would be ideal to use a non-lactose, non-FOS brand<BR>
of acidophillus.<BR>

Forget about what the french cream recipe says.  Have you made yogurt<BR>
successfully before using milk?  If so, then do it the EXACT same way, except<BR>
use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.  The amount of starter makes no difference. <BR>
I've done it a thousand times.  If yours turned out runny and grainy then your<BR>
starter was old and dead or you may have introduced something else into the<BR>
mixture by using a non-sterile utensil or something.  Tell me exactly how you<BR>
are making it step by step.<BR>

Thanks for the reply....<BR>
<BR>
I use a Salton yogurt maker.  I usually use whole milk because I am not =<BR>
worried about fat and more concerned with getting some calories.  I buy =<BR>
regular yogurt from a health food store that is just milk and the =<BR>
bacteria.  The yogurt in the grocery stores all have pectin or other bad =<BR>
stuff in it.  Then I heat the milk to 190 degrees using a candy =<BR>
thermometer.  Then I cool it to about 110 or so and add 1/4 cup starter =<BR>
and 1/2 cup milk, mix it up and add the rest of the milk.  Then that =<BR>
goes into the maker for 24 hours.   So far it has always turned out =<BR>
ok...except for the one time I tried to use half and half.  I think it =<BR>
must have been bad starter.<BR>
<BR>
I will try it again just like you said:  same method, just use half and =<BR>
half instead of milk.  I'll let you know how it turns out!<BR>

I believe that urgency is a result of the area affected-that area near<BR>
the rectum.  The muscles there are supposed to react to stool presence.<BR>
Since there is undoubtedly swelling there, the sence of urgency<BR>
prevails.  My experience has been that the disease &quot;gravitates&quot; to the<BR>
descending colon as I get better, and eventually dissipates.  It means<BR>
she is on the road to recovery.  Stick it out, if at home, so be it.<BR>

&gt; Perhaps there are some who can relate to the following problem and<BR>

&gt; some insight and hopefully the benefit of similar situations.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Our daughter (20) has been faithful (and fanatically devoted) to the<BR>
&gt; diet<BR>
&gt; for 19 months (12 months with meds, Salofalk and Prednisone -20mg).<BR>
&gt; She is<BR>
&gt; diagnosed as having Crohns Colitis - Crohns of the colon.  In that<BR>
&gt; time her<BR>
&gt; weight has continued to increase, she exercises and her bloodwork is<BR>
&gt; returning to normal.  She does not eat any raw fruit and can tolerate<BR>
&gt; some<BR>
&gt; cooked fruits.  She eats much of the rest of the diet including<BR>
&gt; nutbreads,<BR>
&gt; pizza, meats and cheese/yougurt.  In the spring and early summer she<BR>
&gt; had a<BR>
&gt; colonoscopy and she has no disease in her small intestine, her ileum<BR>
&gt; is free<BR>
&gt; of disease and there is superficial disease in the ascending,<BR>
&gt; transverse and<BR>
&gt; decending colon.  There is some disease activity in the last 6 inches<BR>
&gt; involving the sigmoid and the rectum.  The problem she faces is one of<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; urgency.  This has continued to plague her despite the lack of other<BR>
&gt; symtoms<BR>
&gt; that bothered her in the past.  As such, she is very uneasy about<BR>
&gt; getting<BR>
&gt; out, going places and becomes anxious on the days when thing loosen<BR>
&gt; up.  She<BR>
&gt; has not had any formed BM, some days are better than others and there<BR>
&gt; is<BR>
&gt; occasional thickening of the stools - but there are still loose.  We<BR>
&gt; recieved a good suggestion to keep a diary and note things.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Has anybody gone through the same?  Did you notice any particular<BR>
&gt; trend or<BR>
&gt; pattern? Did anything make the urgency better or worse?  How long did<BR>
&gt; it<BR>
&gt; last? and  what other things did you notice.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; This is an extremely trialsome time - the urgency is making her a<BR>
&gt; prisoner<BR>
&gt; in her own home.  Help would be appreciated.<BR>

Sounds like everything you are doing is correct.  When you say you add 1/4 cup<BR>
starter to 1/2 cup milk are you talking about the boiled and cooled milk?  If<BR>
so then everything is fine.  Make sure you mix it in thoroughly.  I keep<BR>
stirring it for 3 minutes or so because otherwise I get lumpy yogurt.  Sounds<BR>
like your starter yogurt may have been old.  If you can locate a powdered<BR>
starter, you should try it.  I found a much better result since I switched from<BR>
commercial yogurt starter to the powdered.  The yogurt is firmer and tastier. <BR>
Good luck and let me know how it turns out.<BR>

Hi all,<BR>
<BR>
Just made the half and half yogurt for the first time; delicious.  I just<BR>
followed the directions in the book for homemade yogurt...<BR>
<BR>
to 1 quart milk or half and half,that has been brought to a simmer (slight<BR>
boil) and that has been returned to normal room temperature while covered<BR>
(I sometimes put under a fan if in a hurry to get it made, to chill it down<BR>
so I can stick in the fridge and finish chilling down to room temperature)<BR>
<BR>
take 1/2 cup of that room temperature milk/or half and half and mix with<BR>
1/4 cup of commerical yogurt (I get the whole milk with cream, &quot;Brown<BR>
Cow&quot;<BR>
brand)<BR>
<BR>
then, add this mixture to the room temp. boiled milk/or half and half and<BR>
put in a plastic or glass container and heat on a heating pad (which I like<BR>
this method best; makes it more creamy and tastes like whipped cream) or<BR>
other suggestions found in the book.<BR>
<BR>
I consume 1/2 gallon on this per week.  Yum.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck!<BR>
