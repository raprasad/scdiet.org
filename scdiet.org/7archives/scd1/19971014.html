Elaine says to start the diet with grape juice, cut by half with water.  I<BR>
find grape juice very comorting and &quot;soft&quot; in feeling to my guts.  But<BR>
everyone is different.  I do think it a good idea to cut any juice by half<BR>
with water, starting out and as the intestines heal, to have more juice and<BR>
less water.<BR>

Dear Moira,<BR>
I had a minor blip in my computer &amp; don't know if you got my reply.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Is there any data on schizophrenic and/or other neurological disorders, and<BR>
how the SCD diet has helped them?<BR>
<BR>
Please read Elaine's chapter on the &quot;brain connection&quot; followed by a letter<BR>
from Mrs. Elder. It pretty much tells the story. Additionally, Elaine's<BR>
daughter had schizophrenic tendancies until she went on the diet and then<BR>
they dissapeared along with her IBD symptoms.<BR>
Rachel<BR>
PS: Elaine says that if you wish, she can refer you to the schizophrenis<BR>
society she's dealt with and they can give you the name of a book on the<BR>
subject. Let me know if you need her phone #<BR>

Hi all.  I'm still very new at this posting thing, but thought I'd let you<BR>
know I went to my gastro today and asked about the SCD.  She thought it<BR>
coincidental I ask about nutrition as she just returned from a seminar (wish<BR>
I'd have asked who sponsored it).  Anyway, she said they (I assume the AMA)<BR>
still says there is no real proof that elimination diets positively affect<BR>
ulcerative colitis patients, although she did listen to my input as to why<BR>
the SCD should work and agreed it was good in theory.  She basically said,<BR>
&quot;If it bothers you, don't eat it!  Use your common sense.&quot;  So, hey, atleast<BR>
she didn't turn her nose up and laugh at me.  She's a good doctor, but a<BR>
doctor nonetheless!<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the SCD for about 13 days now and have seen no improvement.  I'm<BR>
trying to be patient though.  My doctor scheduled me for another full scope<BR>
one month from today if my increased pred doesn't do the trick.  Then she's<BR>
talking about immuno-suppressants from there.  I'm staying with the diet<BR>
though, and hopefully it will reflect positive results before I have to get<BR>
scoped again.<BR>
<BR>
The book says if you don't see improvement after one month (and you've<BR>
actually stuck with it), the diet probably won't work for you.  Anyone have<BR>
any thoughts on that?<BR>

I'm sure it's fine.  I have a yogourmet yogurt maker and it works very well.<BR>
 If the temperature were too high, it would kill the starter and the yogurt<BR>
would be obviously flawed.  As long as the yogurt turns out looking right,<BR>
it's fine (note: there might be some liquid on the top of the yogurt and it<BR>
may need to cool to firm up)<BR>

&gt;Have you, Steve eaten plantains without aversive reactions?  Also, if you<BR>
&gt;want plantain chips, why don't you make them yourself by  frying them?<BR>
&gt; There's a  fried carrots recipe in the book, so I guess plantains get fried<BR>
&gt;the same way.  I had fried bananas once (but they were rolled in sugar&amp;<BR>
&gt;cinnamon, though...the good old days, huh?)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am doing so well so far on the diet that I am afraid of trying something<BR>
&gt;that may disagree with me.  I often have nighmares that I forgot, and ate<BR>
&gt;'forbidden' foods.  I wake up scared and relieved that it was just a<BR>
&gt;nightmare.  Imagine having nighmares about eating bagels and cereal...how<BR>
&gt;bizzare!!<BR>

<BR>
Actually, what I've eaten doesn't really matter too much. The patient at<BR>
our house is our twelve year old son. I have fried plantains before, and I<BR>
like them, but the ones that we buy are the closest thing he gets to the<BR>
kind of snacks he used to eat and that his friends eat at school. A bag of<BR>
chips in his lunch means a little more to him than it would to you or me.<BR>
one of the other parents on this list (Barb) told me about them, and the<BR>
way she put it was like this: &quot;it's hard to expect them to give up<BR>
everything.&quot; She was right too. Early on, I set about finding him a little<BR>
bit of &quot;normal kid food.&quot; To get back to your question though, We have seen<BR>
no adverse reactions whatsoever. Matt's system is pretty tolerant. He eats<BR>
pretty much anything that is allowed on the diet without problem so far.<BR>
Some other people have problems with things we eat every day, so wether a<BR>
particular food goes well with you is something you'll have to find out<BR>
yourself. Also, I know from reading this list that if something doesn't<BR>
work now, that doesn't mean that it won't work later on. What I do know is<BR>
that Elaine has given the nod to plantains<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck,<BR>

Bright blood is usually from the distal colon, as I understand it (dark<BR>
maroon for proximal colon, black for upper GI).  The M.D.s usually want to<BR>
rule out tumor (a possible cause of bleeding), for which they will probably<BR>
want to give you a flexible-sigmoidoscopy.  However, it may just be<BR>
hemorrhoids, which can present as quite a bit of bright blood in the<BR>
toilet, or blood adhering to the stool (like &quot;ketchup on french fries&quot;, as<BR>
one of my docs put it), or bright blood on the toilet tissue.  Hemorrhoids<BR>
can be either external, in which case they'd be visible, or internal, in<BR>
which case they wouldn't.  Perhaps a flex-sig might be necessary to<BR>
diagnose these, I'm not sure.   Or, of course, it could be Chron's<BR>
appearing in the distal colon.  I think I'd get it checked out though -- it<BR>
is important to rule out cancer.  <BR>

&lt;&lt;Suddenly, though, I'm getting a bit concerned.  I've started bleeding and<BR>
that was never one of my symptoms.  I don't have diarreah (I never did have<BR>
a<BR>
big problem with that).  The bleeding isn't continuous--just every couple<BR>
of<BR>
days--but when it appears there's quite a bit of it.  It's bright red with<BR>
a<BR>
few clots.  I've had some minor pain with it--it feels different than the<BR>
crohns pain I've endured for so long.  I'm not bloated and don't feel<BR>
really<BR>
bad.  It's just kinda concerning.  <BR>
<BR>
Should I be worried?  I keep trying to tell myself that bleeding is a<BR>
normal<BR>
part of crohns and lots of people experience it.  I don't get the<BR>
impression<BR>
that it indicates some medical crisis but I don't know.  Should I rush to<BR>
see<BR>
my doctor?  Is there anything in particular as far as the diet that I<BR>
should<BR>
try?  I haven't added any new foods lately.  When the bleeding started I<BR>
was<BR>
overexerting myself--running up and down the stairs at a friend's house<BR>
trying to care for her after surgery (I generally don't do stairs--I live<BR>
on<BR>
one floor at home).  But it hasn't cleared up since I moved back home and<BR>
stopped racing around.<BR>

I keep seeing different figures for the effectiveness of the SCD.  Now<BR>
Dietmar is saying 20% don't respond (that's an 80% success rate!).   I<BR>
believe I've seen 30% elsewhere on this list.  And I think Elaine in a<BR>
recent conversation mentioned 40% (i.e., it doesn't work for 40% of the<BR>
people).  Does anyone have a source for these figures?  And more important,<BR>
can anyone back up these figures?<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I am also a new member to this web site and want to thank all of you who<BR>
contribute to the support of SCD.  It seems easier to stay on the diet when<BR>
you can share with and read about others who are in your same situation.<BR>
<BR>
I have had CD for 14 years and have always felt that diet has played an<BR>
important role  in my health.  I have tried many diets including<BR>
macrobiotics. Then I have a flare up and the doctors put me back on<BR>
predisone, I then loose all self control and eat EVERYTHING good or bad.<BR>
 Looking back it makes since that being raised on a diet HIGH in refined<BR>
sugar, grains,  and dairy has led me where I am today. Facing surgery to<BR>
remove two strictures in my colon.<BR>
<BR>
I have started slowly on the SCD first eliminating sugar and non allowable<BR>
dairy, and now grains and have seen GREAT improvement!!!!! <BR>
<BR>
My concern is that for the past year I have been using a product from Shaklee<BR>
called Performance.  This product has a balance of electrolytes and<BR>
micronutrients important to maintain body fluids.  It REALLY helps with<BR>
cramping.  I feel strongly that this product has kept me out of the hospital<BR>
many times from dehydration.  The problem is that it contains maltodextin,<BR>
fructose, and glucose which the book says are not allowed (I'm not sure about<BR>
the maltodextin).  Does anyone have a reciepe for a drink mix that will<BR>
maintain electrolyte balance?  Plain water just dosen't seem to do.  I have<BR>
to add that I find it very odd that though my history with CD (I have had 9<BR>
gastro doctors) that not one doctor has warned about dehydration!  Any help<BR>
would be greatly appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
To good health!<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; Hi everyone,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I am also a new member to this web site and want to thank all of you who<BR>
&gt; contribute to the support of SCD.  It seems easier to stay on the diet<BR>
when<BR>
&gt; you can share with and read about others who are in your same situation.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have had CD for 14 years and have always felt that diet has played an<BR>
&gt; important role  in my health.  I have tried many diets including<BR>
&gt; macrobiotics. Then I have a flare up and the doctors put me back on<BR>
&gt; predisone, I then loose all self control and eat EVERYTHING good or bad.<BR>
&gt;  Looking back it makes since that being raised on a diet HIGH in refined<BR>
&gt; sugar, grains,  and dairy has led me where I am today. Facing surgery to<BR>
&gt; remove two strictures in my colon.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have started slowly on the SCD first eliminating sugar and non<BR>
allowable<BR>
&gt; dairy, and now grains and have seen GREAT improvement!!!!! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; My concern is that for the past year I have been using a product from<BR>
Shaklee<BR>
&gt; called Performance.  This product has a balance of electrolytes and<BR>
&gt; micronutrients important to maintain body fluids.  It REALLY helps with<BR>
&gt; cramping.  I feel strongly that this product has kept me out of the<BR>
hospital<BR>
&gt; many times from dehydration.  The problem is that it contains<BR>
maltodextin,<BR>
&gt; fructose, and glucose which the book says are not allowed (I'm not sure<BR>
about<BR>
&gt; the maltodextin).  Does anyone have a reciepe for a drink mix that will<BR>
&gt; maintain electrolyte balance?  Plain water just dosen't seem to do.  I<BR>
have<BR>
&gt; to add that I find it very odd that though my history with CD (I have had<BR>
9<BR>
&gt; gastro doctors) that not one doctor has warned about dehydration!  Any<BR>
help<BR>
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; To good health!<BR>
&gt; Joni<BR>

&gt;Dear Moira,<BR>
&gt;I had a minor blip in my computer &amp; don't know if you got my reply.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Is there any data on schizophrenic and/or other neurological disorders, and<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Please read Elaine's chapter on the &quot;brain connection&quot; followed by a letter<BR>
&gt;from Mrs. Elder. It pretty much tells the story. Additionally, Elaine's<BR>
&gt;daughter had schizophrenic tendancies until she went on the diet and then<BR>
&gt;they dissapeared along with her IBD symptoms.<BR>
&gt;Rachel<BR>
&gt;PS: Elaine says that if you wish, she can refer you to the schizophrenis<BR>

Dear Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
I do believe in this diet, am finding it hard to implement, my son is<BR>
screaming for his rice bread/lettuce sandwiches.<BR>
I tried to do it cold turkey, too many tantrums and stress. I am at my wit's<BR>
end.<BR>
<BR>
I am going to try again, for the third time already, gradually phasing the<BR>
carbos out. He has been gluten and casein free with some great improvment,<BR>
for almost a year. He still talks to himself a lot and has other<BR>
schizophrenic like symptoms, also is tactile defensive.<BR>
<BR>
Now, even more deprivation, it is hard.<BR>
<BR>
He has also tested allergic to wheat of course, dairy, beef, nuts, etc. I<BR>
still don't understand how he could go from HAVING alleriges, to NOT having<BR>
allergies on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

I supposedly have a problem with candida and I started with dilute apple<BR>
cider (as per Elaines book), diluted honey (1 tsp in about 12 ozs of<BR>
water), bannana and apples and even raisins.  So far, I have not died as<BR>
expected, and I have had no obvious &quot;Yeasties&quot; reaction, in fact, I<BR>
rather enjoyed the fruit for the first time in about 10 years as I have<BR>
been afraid of them as well!  Glad to be over the fear.  Fruit is good!<BR>

&gt; &gt;What fruits are good to start with? I have had my son on a candida<BR>
&gt; diet for<BR>
&gt; &gt;so long, I feel a little paranoid about fruits. How much fruit can he<BR>
&gt; have?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>

&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So the candida (&quot;Yeast Connection&quot; ???) diet didn't work for him?<BR>

I am on my 16th day on SCD and I am exploring things that I have been<BR>
taught in the past 10 or so years that may well be myths and unnecessary<BR>
worries concerning eating.<BR>
<BR>
One of the things about SCD is a TOTAL lack of concern on Elaines part<BR>
about proper &quot;food combining&quot;.  It (food combining that is) never really<BR>
seemed to work for me anyway but I have had a fear of eating fruit and<BR>
fruit juice etc. with anything other than by itself, and so I end up<BR>
usually not eating fruit at all.  <BR>
<BR>
The theory is that fruit digests very rapidly and if you eat anything<BR>
else with it, it will &quot;ferment and rot and putrify&quot; in your intestines<BR>
allowing all the bad bacteria an opportunity to really make you sick!<BR>
Other proponents of food combining can take it to an even more extreme<BR>
degree.<BR>
<BR>
What have you found in terms of eating fruit with regular food.  I have<BR>
actually begun experimenting some with eating fresh fruit with food and<BR>
so far don't seem to be having any problems with it.  Elaine has not<BR>
said anything about this as far as I know.  Is this food combining stuff<BR>
just a myth???  Look forward to you experienced SCD folks out there!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>

Moira,<BR>
I don't have much advice to give, but my heart goes out to you.  You have<BR>
one of the biggest challenges I can imagine.<BR>
<BR>
About the disappearing allergies, the explanation I have read (and I<BR>
believe it is in Elaine's book, but I'm not sure) is that many allergies<BR>
arise because of a lack of integrity of the cells lining the intestine. <BR>
When damaged, these cells are unable to prevent unwanted proteins from<BR>
crossing into the bloodstream, and once in the blood, the body reacts to<BR>
these proteins as foreign particles.  This causes the allergic reaction.<BR>
<BR>
The SCD heals these intestinal cells, restores the integrity of the<BR>
intestinal lining, so the proteins are no longer getting into the<BR>
bloodstream, and no allergic reaction occurs.<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck<BR>
<BR>

Hi, Kim, <BR>
<BR>
That's a reallygood explanation / theory ... I can see how it could work.<BR>
I don't remember ever reading it, let alone in Elaine's book (at least, I<BR>
don't remember ever reading such a succinct &amp; clear way as you put it) ...<BR>
you sure it was from her?  Or would you be able to remember if it was<BR>
another source?<BR>

Hi all,<BR>
I am new to this list, and have been on the scd diet for a little over a month <BR>
now. Unlike most people on this list I have Cystic Fibrosis. I am wondering if <BR>
any other CF people out there have tried this diet and what their results <BR>
were. Most of my problems are lung related, but I had enough GI involvement to <BR>
prompt me to give the diet a try. I feel much better on it! I am no longer <BR>
bloated, do not get alternating bouts of diarrhea then constipation. I am <BR>
making more trips to the bathroom than before, but this isn't bothering me as <BR>
it is more &quot;normal&quot; if you get my drift. I am intrigued with the benefits not <BR>
consuming carbohydrates could have on my infection levels both in the gut and <BR>
in my lungs. Any input would be greatly appreciated.<BR>

four months ( as well as the gastro esophigal reflux) I feel that I do not<BR>

Don't know what Elaine's &quot;theory&quot; is about food combining and like you,<BR>
Pat, have wondered about all those recipes combining protein with fruit.<BR>
When I do that, I get GAS, CRAMPS...so, it doesn't work for me to use those<BR>
recipes.<BR>

Been on the diet since 6/15 and still not eating raw anything or nuts<BR>
cooked in anything except the nutflour.<BR>

Thanks for your suggestions. I'll try them out and see how the fresh =<BR>

<BR>
I wish I could digest all of the food mentioned in &quot;Breaking the Viscous =<BR>

months so my system may have to heal more before I can try other foods =<BR>
in the book.<BR>
<BR>
I'll tell you, a diet that only consists of eggs, yogurt, blueberries, =<BR>
limited amounts of almond nut bread, meat, and broccoli gets old very =<BR>
quick. So if the foods that you mentioned work, I say thank God that I =<BR>
can handle a few more foods.<BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;All,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The subject of the SCD and the medical establishment and CCFA is of great<BR>
importance.<BR>
&gt;We have a significant grass roots movement now that needs to grow even<BR>
stronger.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I remember when Elaine came to Fort Wayne, I called in advance to the<BR>
leader of the<BR>
&gt;support group for cystic fibrosis.  I wanted her group to know about the<BR>
Elaine's talk<BR>
&gt;and they could come to one of the presentations if they chose to.  The lady<BR>
told me that<BR>
&gt;she would have to check with the doctors to determine if they would allow<BR>
the group to<BR>
&gt;hear about this information.  I think you can guess the result.  This<BR>
practice is fairly<BR>
&gt;common.  It is a form of censorship but I do not think they realize that<BR>
censorship is<BR>
&gt;taking place.  I think they believe they are protecting their group.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;In the long run, I think we need an organization which has a mission to<BR>
perpetuate the<BR>
&gt;SCD.  That would include making information available, be a clearing house<BR>
for<BR>
&gt;questions/answers and take a proactive role in promoting the SCD.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The CCFA is, in my mind, in the fund raising business.  They are well<BR>
organized and do a<BR>
&gt;good job of raising funds.  If bowel diseases were ever cured, I suspect<BR>
the CCFA would<BR>
&gt;change its name and mission and continue to raise funds for another cause.<BR>
This has<BR>
&gt;happened in the past - remember polio.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The medical profession, similarly is in the medicine and operation<BR>
business.  The<BR>
&gt;doctors are well trained and they are good at it.  Unfortunately, the best<BR>
answers are<BR>
&gt;not always medicines and operations.  Keep in mind that doctors have been<BR>
trained for<BR>
&gt;many years in school.  They have been thoroughly immersed in the<BR>
medication/operation<BR>
&gt;methods.  To them, anything that deviates from that training is suspect at<BR>
best.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;We will not turn the corner on this overnight.  We are dealing with one of<BR>
the most<BR>
&gt;powerful establishments in the world.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;John<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John and the group:<BR>
<BR>
We really should be looking at gathering together a long list of<BR>
testimonials from people on this list who have seen a remarkable improvement<BR>
in thier health since using the SCD.  As in the case of myself not once but<BR>
twice,in a five year period, have I seen my colon make a complete recovery.<BR>
Both instances with only Medication for a short while, a few weeks, to stop<BR>
the  bleeding.<BR>
<BR>
The reason for the U.C. returning to my colon  the second time was I had<BR>
gone off the diet in a (limited amount) for approx eight months.<BR>
<BR>
For the doctors to tell me the SCD does not work just does not cut it.<BR>
I see too many people on this list that speak of thier improvements on the<BR>
diet. If I had not seen it happen to my own body, not once but twice, I<BR>
might have reason to be doubtful.<BR>
<BR>
As far as the CCFA or the CCFC is concerned, I gave up on them five years<BR>
ago.  I donot expect they are  going to buy this diet, untill such times as<BR>
the testimonials are stacked as high as their meeting room cieling.  That<BR>
leaves us in the position of either proving it to them, or forgetting about<BR>
them entirely.<BR>
<BR>
I am not on any medications for U. C.  Should you be inclinded to believe I<BR>
have a healthy young colon;  yes, I have a healthy colon, but it is seventy<BR>
years old next month . More proof this diet will work for all ages, young or<BR>
old.<BR>

&gt; Having had my UC completely cured with this wonderful diet now for about<BR>
&gt;four months ( as well as the gastro esophigal reflux) I feel that I do not<BR>
&gt;need all the mail anymore. I will definitely stick to the diet with some<BR>
&gt;minor deviations. I feel that it is the way to assure that the dreaded<BR>
&gt;disease will not return.<BR>
&gt; Good luck to you all. I for one can say thanx and it really did work.<BR>

&gt; Hi all,<BR>
&gt; I am new to this list, and have been on the scd diet for a little over a<BR>
month <BR>
&gt; now. Unlike most people on this list I have Cystic Fibrosis. I am<BR>
wondering if <BR>
&gt; any other CF people out there have tried this diet and what their results<BR>
<BR>
&gt; were. Most of my problems are lung related, but I had enough GI<BR>
involvement to <BR>
&gt; prompt me to give the diet a try. I feel much better on it! I am no<BR>
longer <BR>
&gt; bloated, do not get alternating bouts of diarrhea then constipation. I am<BR>
<BR>
&gt; making more trips to the bathroom than before, but this isn't bothering<BR>
me as <BR>
&gt; it is more &quot;normal&quot; if you get my drift. I am intrigued with the benefits<BR>
not <BR>
&gt; consuming carbohydrates could have on my infection levels both in the gut<BR>
and <BR>
&gt; in my lungs. Any input would be greatly appreciated.<BR>

Dear Bill,<BR>
<BR>
I hope you get this message before you un-subscribe.  I am brand new to the<BR>
list. I<BR>
started the SCD 19 days ago (wow has it been that long?).  I am noticing<BR>
improvement,<BR>
and a side benefit for me is I'm also loosing weight.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, you mentioned a condition called gastro esophigal reflux.  I am not<BR>
familiar with<BR>
this and am curious what it is...if you don't mind explaining before you<BR>
go.<BR>
<BR>
Before I started the diet I have had what I call pain in my ribs. So far no<BR>
doctor has diagnosed<BR>
what it is. A good friend of my said she experienced the same kind of<BR>
excrutiating pain and she<BR>
was diagnosed with an esophigal ulcer.  I don't have the pain all the time,<BR>
but I notice it when<BR>
I have been on my feet too long...like in the kitchen preparing all the<BR>
things for the SCD; or when<BR>
I wear too tight of clothing.<BR>
<BR>
Does anybody else experience this or know what in the world it could be? I<BR>
don't know where to<BR>
start and/or whether the diet will also help this condition?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
Linda<BR>

<BR>
Excellent question.<BR>
<BR>
My experience:  In spring of 1996 I became EXTREMELY ill with a very<BR>
painful non-specific artritic-type inflammation throughout my body,<BR>
something I had NEVER before had in my 40-some years on this orb; the<BR>
doctors simply had no answers &amp; none of their drugs helped, NONE!<BR>
<BR>
(I virtually couldn't move, was virtually bed-bound ... try THAT when you<BR>
have colitis &amp; have to hobble to the washroom)<BR>
<BR>
In desperation (even breathing hurt like torture!) I finally tracked down a<BR>
retired naturopath (with great effort &amp; pain I was at least still able to<BR>
punch in phone numbers!), explained my situation, and he agreed to help me:<BR>
I sent him an evening &amp; morning urine sample via courier (he lives about<BR>
400 miles away), whereupon he gave me a very specific diet, based on food<BR>
combining, to follow.  I'd been extremely ill for 5 weeks and getting worse<BR>
(if that was possible!) ... within 2 days I felt a change with less pain,<BR>
and within 2 weeks it was like I'd never been ill at all!  Unbelievable.<BR>
My physicians (I saw 2 at the time) put it down to &quot;there, there, it was<BR>
probably all in your head&quot; ... they do that when they don't hae any<BR>
answers,  it's such an easy cop-out.  <BR>
<BR>
So THAT time my results with food combining were unbelievable.<BR>
<BR>
Now the flip side: about 6 months later I got sick again, this time though<BR>
not the same problem as in the spring, but rather the start of a severe<BR>
bout with colitis.  I didn't consult the ND because I realized I'd probably<BR>
brought it on myself by &quot;falling off the wagon&quot; and not folliwng his diet<BR>
anymore once I felt so well again, and didn't want to have to face his<BR>
anger or at least disappointment in me.<BR>
<BR>
So I decided &quot;Hey, his programme worked 6 months ago, I'll do it again!&quot;<BR>
and started the same protocol: fruits &amp; starches in the AM, veggies at<BR>
noon, proteins &amp; acid fruits in PM.<BR>
<BR>
This time it did NOT work; in fact, I got worse &amp; worse and after 2 months<BR>
on this protocol thinking I was on the right track, I was doing about 20<BR>
BM's (diarrhoea) per day, and had lost 30#!  I was literally at death's<BR>
door when I decidied I simply was on the wrong track, and the program for<BR>
some reason wasn't going to work this time, so I checked into emergency on<BR>
the verge of respiratory &amp; circulatory collapse ... luckily, they managed<BR>
to pull me back from the edge and basically saved my a** ... doctors DO<BR>
have theur place, e.g. in emergency medicine, it's simply with CHRONIC<BR>
problems that they're pathetic.<BR>
<BR>
After 3 weeks in hospital I got up the courage to call the ND and tell him<BR>
what I just told you: only then did I find out that his protocol for the<BR>
fall episode of illness would have been much different; he told me that he<BR>
would have told me NOT to eat any starches (what we call &quot;refined<BR>
carbohydrates&quot;, sound familiar?), and go easy on the fruits &amp; fats, but to<BR>
concentrate on a few cooked veggies, some meats, home-made youghurt, and<BR>
fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice with the evening (protein) meal.<BR>
<BR>
So, to sum it up: in my experience &quot;food combining&quot; worked once, and failed<BR>
once ... it apparently all &quot;depends&quot; on circumstances!  How's that for<BR>
saying &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; at the same time?<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

&gt;I am on my 16th day on SCD and I am exploring things that I have been<BR>
&gt;taught in the past 10 or so years that may well be myths and unnecessary<BR>
&gt;worries concerning eating.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;One of the things about SCD is a TOTAL lack of concern on Elaines part<BR>
&gt;about proper &quot;food combining&quot;.  It (food combining that is) never really<BR>
&gt;seemed to work for me anyway but I have had a fear of eating fruit and<BR>
&gt;fruit juice etc. with anything other than by itself, and so I end up<BR>
&gt;usually not eating fruit at all.  <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The theory is that fruit digests very rapidly and if you eat anything<BR>
&gt;else with it, it will &quot;ferment and rot and putrify&quot; in your intestines<BR>
&gt;allowing all the bad bacteria an opportunity to really make you sick!<BR>
&gt;Other proponents of food combining can take it to an even more extreme<BR>
&gt;degree.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;What have you found in terms of eating fruit with regular food.  I have<BR>
&gt;actually begun experimenting some with eating fresh fruit with food and<BR>
&gt;so far don't seem to be having any problems with it.  Elaine has not<BR>
&gt;said anything about this as far as I know.  Is this food combining stuff<BR>
&gt;just a myth???  Look forward to you experienced SCD folks out there!<BR>

<BR>
In case it wasn't clear in my previous (long) e-mail, here are the &quot;food<BR>
combining&quot; rules that a retired naturopath gave me last year (1996):<BR>
<BR>
AM (i.e. breakfast): non-acid fruits + starches (carbohydrates)<BR>
<BR>
Mid-Day (i.e. lunch): veggies (cooked or raw), some unsat. oils, some protein<BR>
<BR>
PM (i.e. dinner): protein (e.g meats, nuts, yoghurt, white cheddar) <BR>
    + acid fruits esp. grapefruit (except oranges: not recommended)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As you can see, this needs some modification for the SCD ... somehow the<BR>
calories the &quot;starches&quot; would provide in his programme must be replaced<BR>
with other sources under Elaine's protocol.<BR>

I went to our support group meeting tonight.  It was suggested that the testimonials <BR>
include some background on the persons condition prior to the diet.  That way we would <BR>
have a before and after comparison.<BR>
<BR>
These testimonials are called anecdotal evidence by the medical community and are not <BR>
accepted in the sense of &quot;proof&quot;.  To prove usually requires double blind statistical <BR>
studies.  These testimonials can be viewed from our perspective as fact.  As facts they <BR>

&gt;&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;&gt;All,<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;The subject of the SCD and the medical establishment and CCFA is of great<BR>
&gt;importance.<BR>
&gt;&gt;We have a significant grass roots movement now that needs to grow even<BR>
&gt;stronger.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;I remember when Elaine came to Fort Wayne, I called in advance to the<BR>
&gt;leader of the<BR>
&gt;&gt;support group for cystic fibrosis.  I wanted her group to know about the<BR>
&gt;Elaine's talk<BR>
&gt;&gt;and they could come to one of the presentations if they chose to.  The lady<BR>
&gt;told me that<BR>
&gt;&gt;she would have to check with the doctors to determine if they would allow<BR>
&gt;the group to<BR>
&gt;&gt;hear about this information.  I think you can guess the result.  This<BR>
&gt;practice is fairly<BR>
&gt;&gt;common.  It is a form of censorship but I do not think they realize that<BR>
&gt;censorship is<BR>
&gt;&gt;taking place.  I think they believe they are protecting their group.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;In the long run, I think we need an organization which has a mission to<BR>
&gt;perpetuate the<BR>
&gt;&gt;SCD.  That would include making information available, be a clearing house<BR>
&gt;for<BR>
&gt;&gt;questions/answers and take a proactive role in promoting the SCD.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;The CCFA is, in my mind, in the fund raising business.  They are well<BR>
&gt;organized and do a<BR>
&gt;&gt;good job of raising funds.  If bowel diseases were ever cured, I suspect<BR>
&gt;the CCFA would<BR>
&gt;&gt;change its name and mission and continue to raise funds for another cause.<BR>
&gt;This has<BR>
&gt;&gt;happened in the past - remember polio.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;The medical profession, similarly is in the medicine and operation<BR>
&gt;business.  The<BR>
&gt;&gt;doctors are well trained and they are good at it.  Unfortunately, the best<BR>
&gt;answers are<BR>
&gt;&gt;not always medicines and operations.  Keep in mind that doctors have been<BR>
&gt;trained for<BR>
&gt;&gt;many years in school.  They have been thoroughly immersed in the<BR>
&gt;medication/operation<BR>
&gt;&gt;methods.  To them, anything that deviates from that training is suspect at<BR>
&gt;best.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;We will not turn the corner on this overnight.  We are dealing with one of<BR>
&gt;the most<BR>
&gt;&gt;powerful establishments in the world.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;John<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;John and the group:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;We really should be looking at gathering together a long list of<BR>
&gt;testimonials from people on this list who have seen a remarkable improvement<BR>
&gt;in thier health since using the SCD.  As in the case of myself not once but<BR>
&gt;twice,in a five year period, have I seen my colon make a complete recovery.<BR>
&gt;Both instances with only Medication for a short while, a few weeks, to stop<BR>
&gt;the  bleeding.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The reason for the U.C. returning to my colon  the second time was I had<BR>
&gt;gone off the diet in a (limited amount) for approx eight months.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;For the doctors to tell me the SCD does not work just does not cut it.<BR>
&gt;I see too many people on this list that speak of thier improvements on the<BR>
&gt;diet. If I had not seen it happen to my own body, not once but twice, I<BR>
&gt;might have reason to be doubtful.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;As far as the CCFA or the CCFC is concerned, I gave up on them five years<BR>
&gt;ago.  I donot expect they are  going to buy this diet, untill such times as<BR>
&gt;the testimonials are stacked as high as their meeting room cieling.  That<BR>
&gt;leaves us in the position of either proving it to them, or forgetting about<BR>
&gt;them entirely.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am not on any medications for U. C.  Should you be inclinded to believe I<BR>
&gt;have a healthy young colon;  yes, I have a healthy colon, but it is seventy<BR>
&gt;years old next month . More proof this diet will work for all ages, young or<BR>
&gt;old.<BR>

Pat,<BR>
<BR>
What a coincidence that you brought up the food combination issue.  I was<BR>
just thinking the same thing when I read about eating fruit with yougurt or<BR>
cheese.  According to books such as Fit For Life, and other ones I read,<BR>
fruit should be eaten alone on an empty stomach 30 min. before a meal or 4-6<BR>
hours after a protein or starch meal.<BR>
<BR>
Like you said, the fruit requires minimal time to digest (20-45 minutes:dried<BR>
fruit and bananas take 45 minutes) while proteins take about 4 hours.<BR>
 According to the literature, fruit that becomes trapped with other food in<BR>
the stomach begins to ferment, potentially causing the entire contents to<BR>
putrify and cause gas and bloating.  OK, I know some of us can do without the<BR>
excess gas ad bloating.  Also, according the these authors, improper food<BR>
combination can cause havoc on the digestive system and wear it down along<BR>
with destroying the integrity of the food by fermenting it or causing it to<BR>
putrify.  So, what quality of nutrients are we absorbing then?<BR>
<BR>
I found that when I used to eat fruit at meals I used to develop terrible<BR>
stomach aches which mistakenly I blamed the fruit and became afraid to eat<BR>
them.  After I found out about food combination, I ate fruit alone with no<BR>
problem.  <BR>
<BR>
Fruit also helps cleanse the intestines, and sometimes fruit reacts with<BR>
remaining intestinal and stomach debris and cause some bloating.  Otherwise<BR>
there should be no problem.<BR>
<BR>
My question is, if so many nutritionists who study the effects of food on the<BR>
digestive system individually state the same thing about food combination,<BR>
then why hasn't Elaine mention it?  I know we don't have to be concerned<BR>
about combining starch with protein, but I am a little bit concerned about<BR>
fruit and other foods.<BR>
<BR>
Those of you who read the recipes I posted noticed they are all from the Fit<BR>
For Life Cookbook.  All the fruit-based deserts contain nothing but fruit,<BR>
nuts, seeds, honey, and nut milks which are digestively compatible.<BR>
<BR>
Any take on this?  If anyone disagrees, remember I am just the messenger, so<BR>
don't kill ME.<BR>
<BR>

I told him about the diet.  He hadn't heard of it but was interested.  Two of<BR>

Ever since Pat posted that great question about combining fruit etc., I've<BR>
been waiting to see what you all had to say.  Does someone save difficult<BR>
questions and then give them to Elaine all at once instead of calling her<BR>
individually? My 2 cents.  About a year ago I read &quot;The Zone&quot;  have sinced<BR>
loaned it to a friend and don't have it to refer to, but I have seen it<BR>
mentioned here before.  The author, Barry Sears, combines a protein, carbo,<BR>
and fat in specific ratios to each other at every meal and snack. This<BR>
regulates insulin levels, controls free radicals, etc. and is described as a<BR>
steady drip (like and IV) of food throughout the day. I don't ever remember<BR>
in the book advice on eating fruit separate, just in proportion to the<BR>
protein and fat.  I find I have a problem if I eat too much fruit, which I<BR>
think there is a tendency to do, because we don't eat junk food and fruit<BR>
seems &quot;legal&quot;.  I know we've been told to basically put blinders on and<BR>
follow the SCD which I'm prepared to do, but we all have read and been taught<BR>
other nutritional theories and sometimes it's just hard to blank that out of<BR>
your mind.  Take care, Jane<BR>

	Dear All,<BR>
                 I just wanted to write and encourage you all to stick to<BR>
the plan. I made a big boo boo . My wonderful Aunt who makes the best pies<BR>
in the world brought us over a blackberry pie. Now this is my very favorite<BR>
pie in the world and I had not had any in a year. So I figured well go<BR>
ahead. Big mistake. After eating the pie the next morning I awoke with the<BR>
first colon on fire feeling I have had in at least 9 months. I ate the pie<BR>
on Tuesday night it is now Thursday and my colon is still letting me know<BR>
how angry it is at my falling off the wagon. <BR>
	So for those that are tempted  it is not worth it. No more pie for me .<BR>
    I myself would be very cautious of enemas, it just makes me think of<BR>
colonoscopy preparation that always threw me into a very long tail spin.<BR>
                                                  Take Care,<BR>

'Super Aspirin' May Help Prevent Bowel Cancer<BR>
<BR>
LONDON (Reuters) - A new class of drugs known as &quot;super aspirin&quot; could<BR>
help<BR>
prevent and even treat bowel cancer, British doctors said Wednesday.<BR>
<BR>
It has all the benefits of normal aspirin but none of the side effects<BR>
when<BR>
taken in high doses.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are very excited by the possibility of using aspirin-like drugs<BR>
because<BR>
they could pave the way for better ways of preventing and perhaps one<BR>
day<BR>
even treating bowel cancer,&quot; Dr. Chris Paraskeva, of Bristol University,<BR>
said in a statement.<BR>
<BR>
Regular aspirin has been shown to help prevent heart disease and bowel<BR>
cancer but used over a long period of time or in high doses it can cause<BR>
ulcers or bleeding of the stomach lining.<BR>
<BR>
Researchers tested a member of the super aspirin family called NS-398 on<BR>
samples of cancerous cells taken from the large bowel and cultivated in<BR>
the<BR>
laboratory.<BR>
<BR>
The super aspirin was 50 times more effective than aspirin in making the<BR>
cancer cells kill themselves.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The fact that both they and aspirin can cause bowel cancer cells to<BR>
self-destruct may also explain why these drugs could have a preventive<BR>
effect on the disease,&quot; added Paraskeva.<BR>
<BR>
Gordon McVie, the director general of the Cancer Research Campaign, said<BR>
the charity was already planning a study into whether aspirin is<BR>
effective<BR>
in preventing bowel cancer in high risk patients.<BR>
<BR>
He called for further research into super aspirins and advised people<BR>
not<BR>
to take high doses of regular aspirin which could be harmful.<BR>
<BR>
Bowel cancer is one of the most deadly forms of cancer, killing up to<BR>
500,000 people each year.<BR>

If you have ever found yourself standing in the kitchen with almond batter covered clothes . . .<BR>

 I joined the list several months ago, after six successful months on the diet.  At the time I (with perhaps na?ve enthusiasm) planned to work with the group to gather, edit, and publish a book of testimonials.  When I sent out the &quot;call&quot; to gather testimonials (I wasn't the first to do this), Mik suggested that I first edit the testimonials contained on the SCD page.  While working on this task, I jotted down ideas of what kind of information should be included in a book testimonial.   However, after completing the editing of the 60 pages of testimonials, I started taking graduate classes after work* and let the book idea fall by the wayside.  I consoled myself by saying Elaine's book, Mik's website, and Renee's website were widely available and a compilation of testimonials would just contain extraneous and repeated information.  (*something I didn't have the endurance for before the SCD)<BR>
<BR>
However, I again realize the potential positive impact of publishing a book of testimonials:<BR>
--For people thinking about trying the diet, it would help allay concerns/fears.  <BR>
 &quot;This diet's makes no sense.  Eat raw salads?!  Have an apple?!  I haven't done that in years.  This woman's crazy.&quot;<BR>
&quot;I'm not sure about this.  My doctor says diet has little to do with UC/CD.&quot;<BR>
--For people starting the diet,  it would show that individual responses to the diet vary and that people will have to tailor it to their own needs.  Testimonials could include subjects such as: how long it took to feel better, fatigue, exercise habits, complementary therapies (vitamins, acupuncture, yoga etc.), cutting down on medication, weight loss/gain, eating out, etc.<BR>
--In addition to helping the tens of thousands of IBD sufferers out there, putting together personal testimonials would also be cathartic?just like Prateeshka flushing the pages of her journal (or my once swollen knuckles sloppily striking away at a punching bag).  (For those of you not wishing to expose your bowel habits to public scrutiny, we could definitely use aliases or just first names).<BR>
--For the CCFA, etc.   A widespread book would add to the legitimacy of the diet and hopefully make the CCFA fundraisers (who don't have IBD), a bit nervous.  In addition, more doctors may be willing to try it.  (Eleven months after a two-day hospital stay, I recently went back to my surprised GI who said, &quot;You look great!&quot;.  He wrote down the book title and wanted to discuss it further.  Frustrated, he told me, &quot;We just don't hear about these things.  There's so many people with this and many have to keep going back to the [damn] steroids.&quot;  (This is not my first GI, the earlier ones had me drugged to the hilt?to the point of became a case study  for quality control at a now defunct HMO)<BR>
<BR>
If we work together to put a compilation of testimonials together a draft could be completed by January 1998. I'm ready to receive, edit, and/or rewrite any testimonials.  In addition, I'd be happy to call or meet with anyone who wants tell their story.  I've also been saving some e-mail from people who have given snippets of their SCD experience.  So please don't be surprised if I start sending requests.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for taking the time to read this!  After that spiel, I'm now going to eat a piece of Lois Lang's Luscious Bread!<BR>

Take care,<BR>

P.S.  In terms of publishing the book, any $ from sales could go back to the SCD-group to help w/ future projects.<BR>

There is a huge difference.  The scope prep uses irritating agents to<BR>
cause the GI tract to expell everything in it, and greatly increase the<BR>
peristaltic action.  Not only that, but the doctor sticks a tube up your<BR>
butt, does biospies, forces the instrument around corners. You have to<BR>
have pain killers it is so invasive and violent! No wonder you have a<BR>
tailspin.  I'm not sure about fleet enemas and salt water enemas, but<BR>
plain and some herbal enemas just wash out the stuff and shouldn't be<BR>
irritating at all.<BR>
<BR>
And just to show that the AMA acknoledges prep-induced irritation:<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; Excellent question.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; My experience:  In spring of 1996 I became EXTREMELY ill with a very<BR>
&gt; painful non-specific artritic-type inflammation throughout my body,<BR>
&gt; something I had NEVER before had in my 40-some years on this orb; the<BR>
&gt; doctors simply had no answers &amp; none of their drugs helped, NONE!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; (I virtually couldn't move, was virtually bed-bound ... try THAT when<BR>
&gt; you<BR>
&gt; have colitis &amp; have to hobble to the washroom)<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; In desperation (even breathing hurt like torture!) I finally tracked<BR>
&gt; down a<BR>
&gt; retired naturopath (with great effort &amp; pain I was at least still able<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; punch in phone numbers!), explained my situation, and he agreed to<BR>
&gt; help me:<BR>
&gt; I sent him an evening &amp; morning urine sample via courier (he lives<BR>
&gt; about<BR>
&gt; 400 miles away), whereupon he gave me a very specific diet, based on<BR>
&gt; food<BR>
&gt; combining, to follow.  I'd been extremely ill for 5 weeks and getting<BR>
&gt; worse<BR>
&gt; (if that was possible!) ... within 2 days I felt a change with less<BR>
&gt; pain,<BR>
&gt; and within 2 weeks it was like I'd never been ill at all!<BR>
&gt; Unbelievable.<BR>
&gt; My physicians (I saw 2 at the time) put it down to &quot;there, there, it<BR>
&gt; was<BR>
&gt; probably all in your head&quot; ... they do that when they don't hae any<BR>
&gt; answers,  it's such an easy cop-out.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So THAT time my results with food combining were unbelievable.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Now the flip side: about 6 months later I got sick again, this time<BR>
&gt; though<BR>
&gt; not the same problem as in the spring, but rather the start of a<BR>
&gt; severe<BR>
&gt; bout with colitis.  I didn't consult the ND because I realized I'd<BR>
&gt; probably<BR>
&gt; brought it on myself by &quot;falling off the wagon&quot; and not folliwng his<BR>
&gt; diet<BR>
&gt; anymore once I felt so well again, and didn't want to have to face his<BR>
&gt; anger or at least disappointment in me.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So I decided &quot;Hey, his programme worked 6 months ago, I'll do it<BR>
&gt; again!&quot;<BR>
&gt; and started the same protocol: fruits &amp; starches in the AM, veggies at<BR>
&gt; noon, proteins &amp; acid fruits in PM.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; This time it did NOT work; in fact, I got worse &amp; worse and after 2<BR>
&gt; months<BR>
&gt; on this protocol thinking I was on the right track, I was doing about<BR>
&gt; 20<BR>
&gt; BM's (diarrhoea) per day, and had lost 30#!  I was literally at<BR>
&gt; death's<BR>
&gt; door when I decidied I simply was on the wrong track, and the program<BR>
&gt; for<BR>
&gt; some reason wasn't going to work this time, so I checked into<BR>
&gt; emergency on<BR>
&gt; the verge of respiratory &amp; circulatory collapse ... luckily, they<BR>
&gt; managed<BR>
&gt; to pull me back from the edge and basically saved my a** ... doctors<BR>
&gt; DO<BR>
&gt; have theur place, e.g. in emergency medicine, it's simply with CHRONIC<BR>
&gt; problems that they're pathetic.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; After 3 weeks in hospital I got up the courage to call the ND and tell<BR>
&gt; him<BR>
&gt; what I just told you: only then did I find out that his protocol for<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; fall episode of illness would have been much different; he told me<BR>
&gt; that he<BR>
&gt; would have told me NOT to eat any starches (what we call &quot;refined<BR>
&gt; carbohydrates&quot;, sound familiar?), and go easy on the fruits &amp; fats,<BR>
&gt; but to<BR>
&gt; concentrate on a few cooked veggies, some meats, home-made youghurt,<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice with the evening (protein) meal.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So, to sum it up: in my experience &quot;food combining&quot; worked once, and<BR>
&gt; failed<BR>
&gt; once ... it apparently all &quot;depends&quot; on circumstances!  How's that for<BR>
&gt; saying &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; at the same time?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 		Sincerely, <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 		Dietmar<BR>

&gt; &gt;I am on my 16th day on SCD and I am exploring things that I have been<BR>
&gt; &gt;taught in the past 10 or so years that may well be myths and<BR>
&gt; unnecessary<BR>
&gt; &gt;worries concerning eating.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;One of the things about SCD is a TOTAL lack of concern on Elaines<BR>
&gt; part<BR>
&gt; &gt;about proper &quot;food combining&quot;.  It (food combining that is) never<BR>
&gt; really<BR>
&gt; &gt;seemed to work for me anyway but I have had a fear of eating fruit<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; &gt;fruit juice etc. with anything other than by itself, and so I end up<BR>
&gt; &gt;usually not eating fruit at all.  <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;The theory is that fruit digests very rapidly and if you eat anything<BR>
&gt; &gt;else with it, it will &quot;ferment and rot and putrify&quot; in your<BR>
&gt; intestines<BR>
&gt; &gt;allowing all the bad bacteria an opportunity to really make you sick!<BR>
&gt; &gt;Other proponents of food combining can take it to an even more<BR>
&gt; extreme<BR>
&gt; &gt;degree.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;What have you found in terms of eating fruit with regular food.  I<BR>
&gt; have<BR>
&gt; &gt;actually begun experimenting some with eating fresh fruit with food<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; &gt;so far don't seem to be having any problems with it.  Elaine has not<BR>
&gt; &gt;said anything about this as far as I know.  Is this food combining<BR>
&gt; stuff<BR>
&gt; &gt;just a myth???  Look forward to you experienced SCD folks out there!<BR>
