Dear Mik,

<P>This letter is a follow-up to a previous letter that I sent to you
posted
in the &QUOT;Letters From the
 Mailing List&QUOT; 1997&nbsp; #16 Gottschall's Diet.&nbsp; I have attached
emails sent to doctors, professors
 and individuals involved with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome which I believe
to be interrelated to
 intestinal dysbiosis and similar bacterial microbes causing
inflammatory
bowel disorders.
<BR>Fortunately for me I was introduced to a potent probiotic which
complements
Elaine's diet.
<BR>A lifetime of loose and frequent stools has been totally eliminated.
The beneficial bacteria
 introduced to the intestinal environment are synthesizing the vitamins
and minerals that I previously
 wasn't absorbing. My energy level continues to improve and I am now
on a treadmill thirty minutes
 every morning. The color has returned to my skin.
<BR>If you or anyone reading this letter would like a doctors
explanation
for what I have experienced
 please email me at:&nbsp; <A
HREF="mailto:ctfutures@aol.com">ctfutures@aol.com</A> &nbsp;&nbsp; and I
will
send you an audio tape by Dr.James T. Reese
 with a professional viewpiont of this probiotic.&nbsp; I have sent
a copy to Elaine Gottschall.

<P><B>What I had to go through to get to this point is as follows:</B>

<P>[Carl Tuttle]&nbsp; Dear Tim,
<BR>I thought I would keep you in the loop.This is a recent letter
<BR>sent to a friend who has CFS.
<BR>Im doing great!

<P>Jan 6, 1998

<P>I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in May of 96.&nbsp; Not
waiting for someone
 to find a cure for this illness I embarked on a one year
research
project on my own to
 get to the root of the problem.

<P>What I have uncovered is as follows:

<P>All of my symptoms were a result of an intestinal bacteria.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; -This bacteria feeds on carbohydrates and starches and
any sugar whatsoever including fruits
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Prescription antibiotics while effective in the short
term eventually&nbsp; proved ineffective
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Natural agents (grapefruit seed extract,black walnut
extract,wormwood extract,berberine,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uva-ursi,ginger extract) all produced
die-off
which is a feeling of worsening symptoms
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when the bacteria die off in great numbers
as toxins are released into the blood stream.

<P>Immeadiate relief came after starting the Gottchall Diet, which
eliminates
the carbohydrates
<BR>and starches that feed this bacteria. The book &QUOT;Breaking the Vicious
Cycle&QUOT; by Elaine Gottschall
<BR>$16.95 at Barnes and Noble, has recipes for individual meals.

<P>Working with a doctor who uses The Great Smokies Diagnostic Lab
allowed
me to isolate and
<BR>identify the bacteria responsible for my illness through a
comprehensive
digestive analysis
<BR>(stool sample). In addition the bacteria was found in my small
intestine
through a breath test.
<BR>After drinking a challenge drink of lactulose breath samples are
collected
in vacuum tubes
<BR>every 15 min for the next two hrs. If&nbsp; levels of hydrogen and
methane gases are detected it is
<BR>an indication of the bacteria digesting the sugar. Pathogenic
bacteria
should not be in the small intestine.

<P>I am convinced that the toxins released by this bacteria cause the
brain
fog. The liver is overwhelmed
<BR>trying to filter out all these toxins and what is circulating in the
blood reaches the brain as well.

<P>I have been able to control the proliferation of this bacteria by
eliminating
its food source through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elaine's diet.
<BR>Through the help of a Naturopath I have changed the intestinal
environment
so that it is more
<BR>acidic and not alkaline. Pathogenic bacteria do not thrive in an
acidic
environment. I have added&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lemon juice(freshly
squeezed)
and ginger extract along with colloidal bentonite clay ,digestive
<BR>enzymes,vitamins and minerals under the guidance of Dr. Jack Larmer
N.D.
<BR>&nbsp;.
<BR>I no longer have any brain fog
<BR>I stay up past 10:00PM
<BR>I have one bowel movement per day(no diarrher)
<BR>I go skiing with my family
<BR>I have NO FATIGUE
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Find a doctor in your area who uses the Great Smokies Lab (They have
a doctor locator on their
<BR>Web site) and identify any and all pathogens.
<BR>Buy the book &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot;
<BR>If you don't stop eating the traditional American diet you won't get
well!
<BR>Find a Doctor of Naturopathy who is familiar with treating the gut
<BR>Remember that there are twenty feet of small intestine and it will
take time to heal the damage
<BR>done and return it to healthy status. Don't get discouraged if you
don't see immediate results.
<BR>Everybody including myself wants a miracle pill that works
overnightŠŠŠ..it
just isn't the case
 with this
illness. I am proof that you can beat this devastating illness

<P>Any information provided in this document is not to be considered
medical
advice.
<BR>Iam not a doctor and you should consult a doctor before taking any
medicine or natural agents.

<P>The information provided is a true account of my own experience.

<P>Good luck and get well!

<P>Research is being conducted at the University of Newcastle in Sydney
Australia by Professor
 Tim Roberts and colleagues who believe that the debilitating
symptoms
of CFS is a result of
 changes in the bacteria of the gut. (Reported by Reuters Health
Information
Services,Sept.9.1997)
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear Tim,

<P>Thank you for responding to my email. It has been difficult at best
to
 get people to listen to me regarding the bacteria theory. Most
people
are
 looking for that &QUOT;magic bullet&QUOT; (wonder drug)that is a cure-all for
this
 debilatiting illness. The thought that diet and natural agents could
 control and ultimately eliminate the illness is beyond belief.
<BR>Early in this century doctors and scientists were baffled by a
serious
 and lethal illness producing a mysterious rash, diarrhea,
schizophrenia-like
 dementia and death. Most all of these cases were limited to the
lower
working
 class and prison population. It was determined that this illness was
diet 
related. A poor diet low in niacin caused the desease known as Pellagra.
<BR>Even as people recovered after eating a more balanced diet, the
doctor
responsible for the discovery at that time was faced with criticism and disbelief.
<BR>Since my last email to you I have uncovered yet another situation
that
 I believe is the most important to date. Through my reading I have
learned
 that all intestinal bacteria compete for space and the dominant
strains
 win out over the benificial bacteria when the apple cart has been
disturbed
 either by antibiotics, antacids, viruses, poor nutrition,(too much
sugar) etc.
<BR>Once those virulent strains sets up shop its next to impossible to
reverse
 the situation and return to a healthy balance. Everything we put in
our mouth
 will have a direct effect on that environment. Many CFS sufferers,
myself
 included, report an improvement while on antibiotics. While
temporarily 
reducing 
the pathogen in question, beneficial bacteria populations are also being
systematically 
eliminated, forever perpetuating the vicious cycle.

<P>Instead of trying to shoot the bacteria with that magic bullet, why
not fight bacteria 
with bacteria. Not just any bacteria but a specific group designed to
devour
any pathogen 
and restore that invironment to healthy status.
<BR>I believe that I am now taking the correct combination of beneficial
<BR>bacteria in sufficient quantities necessary to reestablish
healthy&nbsp;
populations.
<BR>I began taking these capsules on Saturday Jan. 10Th and within the
hour
 experienced &QUOT;Herxheimer reaction&QUOT; (die-off) lasting most of the
morning.
<BR>This die-off has been experienced with natural substances as
reported
 in my previous email. This is the first time a group of beneficial
bacteria
 has produced this effect. My past experience with die-off was an
indication
that a 
substance was effective. I will keep you informed of my progress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>I was unaware of the confrence scheduled in February. After
reviewing
 the site it looks like the who's who of CFS research. I would be
interested 
in
their thoughts on what we have discussed.

<P>I will fax test results that you requested from the Great Smokies
Diagnostic
Lab.
<BR>Tim, I am doing well and its by no accident. I spent the last year
and a
half experimenting&nbsp; and finally I can honestly say that it has paid off
and I feel
that this approach is having a lasting effect.

<P>I hope you are well,

<P>&gt;Dear Carl,
<BR>&gt;Thanks for the email about your health and its relationship to diet
and bacteria.
<BR>&gt;Could you send me more info on the bacterial testing and what it
showed
please?
<BR>&gt;We are doing a lot on the role of gut bacteria as you can see from
our web page and
what you reported is most relevant and exciting.

<P>Dear Tim,

<P>I have assembled the documents you requested from the Great Smokies
Lab. A total
<BR>of nineteen pages will be Faxed to: +61-02-4921-7281&nbsp;&nbsp; Is
this the correct number?
<BR>Prof. Garth Nicolson is also interested in the information I have
and
has sent a list
 of his recommendations for Gulf War Illness/CFS/FMS treatment. Here
is my
last email to him:
<BR>&nbsp;

<HR>
<BR>
<P>January 26, 1998
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Institute for Molecular Medicine
<BR>15162 Triton Lane
<BR>Huntington Beach, CA 92649
<BR>Attn:&nbsp; Prof. Garth L. Nicolson

<P>Dear Professor Nicolson,

<P>Thank you for responding to my email.&nbsp; There are items of
concern
in your list of recommendations that I would like to point out.&nbsp;
Please
understand I mean no disrespect if I should disagree with your
ideas.&nbsp;
I will do my best at explaining why I have arrived at my conclusions
through
my own experiences.

<P>Carbohydrates and starches are complex sugars which require digestion
before absorption.&nbsp; A damaged or improperly functioning digestive
tract cannot break these complex sugars down completely leaving a
residue
available for fermentation by the pathogenic bacteria.&nbsp; Eliminating
bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, all grains and corn is extremely
important.&nbsp;
If these foods are not eliminated the food source is still available for
these pathogens to exist.&nbsp; Simple sugars found in fruits are easily
absorbed and don't require the same complex digestive process.&nbsp;
Excessive
fruit intake however, will also cause problems with too much
sugar.&nbsp;
Cooked fruits are better because the cooking process reduces the sugar
content.&nbsp; The idea here is to starve the bacteria not the
patient.&nbsp;
There is plenty of additional food to eat as outlined in Elaine
Gottschall's
book &QUOT; Breaking the Vicious Cycle.&QUOT;&nbsp; Unless you ferment your own
yogurt
for a minimum of 24 hours the store bought yogurt contains too much
lactose,
yet another sugar.&nbsp; I myself drink mostly water.&nbsp; Fruit juice
would introduce even more sugar.&nbsp; No dried fruits whatsoever
because
they are pure sugar.&nbsp; FOS is a sugar as well and not allowed.

<P>The bacteria responsible for my illness produced anemia.&nbsp; The
only
combination of beneficial bacteria to date is as follows:&nbsp;
Lactobacillus
Acidophilus Bifidobacterium Bifidum, Bacillus Licheniformis, Bacillus
Subtilis,
Lactobacillus Lactis, and Lactobacillus Bulgaricus.&nbsp; The above
mentioned
combination actually produced Herxheimer reaction and returned the pink
color to my skin.&nbsp; Additional capsules include Lactobacillus
Plantarum
and Lactobacillus Salavarious.

<P>I am convinced that this illness originates in the gut and given an
opportunity it will travel throughout the entire system.&nbsp; Starving
this pathogen has produced the only lasting results.

<P>Sincerely,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Professor Roberts,

<P>I meant to send you this email as well:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Subj: Re: cfids
<BR>Date: 98-01-08 21:56:36 EST:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dear Glo,

<P>Although the bacteria may originate in the gut it will travel
throughout
 the entire body causing a multitude of symptoms. The bacteria found
 in my gut (citrobacter frundii) was responsible for pneumonia and
recurrent
 sinus infections not to mention being bedridden with devestating
fatigue.
<BR>The bacteria is capable of entering the bloodstream through
lesions
on
 on the intestinal walls. If I should cheat and eat any
carbohydrates,starches
 or too many fruits the first sign of a relapse is a stiff neck
followed
by
 sinus
 congestion, lung congestion ,fatigue, loose stools, chest pain,
shortness
of
 breath, anemia, painful joints and the debilitating brain fog just
to name a
 few.<BR>
 Symptoms vary from case to case. Advanced stages are far worse than
I have
 experienced , but I was headed in that direction.&nbsp; If an
exclusionary
diet can
 produce improvement its worth trying.

<P>Im sorry to hear about your daughters condition, my daughter is seven
years
 old and I know how important they are to us.  If you have any
other questions
 please feel free to ask.<BR>
<BR>Carl W. Tuttle
