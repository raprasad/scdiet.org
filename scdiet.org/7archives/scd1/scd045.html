<B>FLAX SEED SHAKE</B><BR>
<BR>
Here's a receipe to a great tasting and soothing flax seed shake I recently discovered.  <BR>
<BR>
Besides Omega-3 EPA fish oil, flax seed is the next best source for Omega 3<BR>
essential fatty acid.  I'm sure most of you are aware of the recent research<BR>
discoveries on the healing qualities of Omega 3 in regard to UC and CD.  <BR>
<BR>
Omega 3 has been shown to exhibit inflammation reducing properties which keeps<BR>
Crohn's in remission longer.  It has also been shown to encourage intestinal<BR>
cell regrowth and an increase in intestinal mucosal area.<BR>
<BR>
Here's the receipe:<BR>
<BR>
6 tablespoons of flax seed<BR>
2 bananas<BR>
2 cups apple or orange juice.<BR>
1 cup plain SCD yogurt<BR>
<BR>
Grind the flax seed into a moist flour using an electric coffee grinder or<BR>
other food processing type appliance.<BR>
<BR>
Combine with bananas, yogurt and fruit juice in a blender.<BR>
<BR>
Blend until smooth and creamy.<BR>
<BR>
I usually make one in the morning for breakfast.  It's very filling, feels<BR>
great on your stomach and is quick and easy to make.  <BR>
<BR>
Enjoy.<BR>

<BR>
Please correct me if I am wrong. I find no reference to flaxseed in the<BR>
SCD. The closest reference I find is under the heading &quot;not permitted&quot;:<BR>
&quot;amaranth flour, quinoa flour or any newly introduced grain substitutes<BR>
such as cottonseed.&quot; Perhaps I've missed it as an allowable item, but if<BR>
not, I'd say it is generally a good idea to keep away from sharing recipes<BR>
that include questionable ingrediants. What a person chooses to include in<BR>
his or her diet is strictly their business, however, as has been pointed<BR>
out numerous times, this list is frequented by newbies who are struggling<BR>
to make the SCD a part of lives. To include questionable recipes on this<BR>
site is irresponsible.<BR>

<BR>
Flax seeds are not a &quot;grain substitute&quot;. They are a source of water<BR>
soluable fiber (unlike the non-soluable kind in grains). They are highly<BR>
recommended for use in treating CD and they can also serve to firm up<BR>
stools. They don't really break down, even in a healthy personb, they<BR>
are more of an intestinal sponge, which has been shown to help remove<BR>
gunk and microorganisms from the lining of the intestines. If you have<BR>
serious inflamation I'd stay away from the whole seeds as they might<BR>
cause mechanical irritaion but the oil should be helpful. Eating them<BR>
ground should be fine and eating the oil (available in liquid or<BR>
capsules) is highly recommended. Yes do the SCD but do the other things,<BR>
vitamins, herbs, exercise that help too.<BR>
<BR>
PS. For the record, flax seed is MUCH higher in Omega 3's than fish<BR>
liver oil (as much as 10 times as high). It isn't complimented with<BR>
vitamin A though the way fish liver oil is, among other trace minerals<BR>
and so may not be as effective (or may be more effective, who knows, I<BR>
take both).<BR>

HiRachel,<BR>
Flaxseed is a seed. The shake is prouably okay if your a few months into scd.<BR>
The problem i noticed with flax seed it it would taste like a &quot;fish Shake&quot;.<BR>
We're allowed seeds after three or six months. Or one can use flaxseed oil<BR>
without problem. NO matter how healthy flax seed is for the body it makes me<BR>
want to gag when i eat them. Before scd I tried sprinkling ground organic flax<BR>
seeds on my fruit.<BR>
They have fishy flavor and smell &lt;yuck&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Eating a lot of fresh salmon and other fish is a much tastier and scd friendly<BR>
way  for everyone in different stages of the diet to get Omega 3.<BR>

I appologize if I have mislead, confused or frightened anyone by the receipe<BR>
for flaxseed shakes I posted this morning.   By no means would I want to<BR>
suggest a food which would unknowingly contaminate the diet.<BR>
<BR>
I would be very interested however in having flaxseed confirmed as either<BR>
&quot;allowable&quot; or &quot;forbidden,&quot; before it is completely discounted.   <BR>
<BR>
For those individuals, such as myself, who are not new to the diet and have<BR>
become routine with the commitment and adherence it requires, I would like to<BR>
think this forum would allow the discussion and sharing of ideas which would<BR>
incorporate experimentation with the diet's potential within the parameters of<BR>
Ms. Gotschall's research.  I know I would be quite grateful to anyone who<BR>
could introduce a new &quot;allowable&quot; food to the diet which would extend our<BR>
eating options.  Having heard Ms. Gotschall lecture, I can't believe she would<BR>
not be open to the responsible evolution of her diet, nor would she approve of<BR>
a blind adherence to anything.<BR>
<BR>
I sincerely hope that critical thinking and the creative process are not<BR>
considered irresponsible.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

Dear Richard,<BR>
I spoke to Elaine &amp; she is not a firm beleiver in all these new alternative<BR>
therapies we've been hearing about. It is not a matter of being<BR>
closeminded, she simply feels that a lot more documantation (naturally not<BR>
by the manufacturers) would be needed to prove success.<BR>
As for flaxseed, she says it is much too harsh for our digestive systems.<BR>
For those that insist, she recommends a maximum of a tspn of flaxseed oil a<BR>
day supplemented by addititional vitimin e to compensate for what she calls<BR>
the &quot;doublebond&quot; affect of this product. For additional information, I'd<BR>
suggest you call her directly.<BR>

<BR>
 Ground flaxseed should have a pleasant nutty taste.  If it smells like fish<BR>
then its probably rancid.  Flax should be consumed immediately after<BR>
grinding as it is quite perishable, and if you have to store ground flax<BR>
seed, it should be in the refridgerator.<BR>
<BR>
Ground flax has mucilage which is nice and gentle on the colon;  however<BR>
some find it gives them D.  Perhaps its an individual thing.  As an aside,<BR>
My husband Brad kept his CD largely under control for 10 years, pre-SCD,<BR>
with just a couple of tablespoons of bran (NOT allowed on SCD!) per day.<BR>
Theory was that it swept the colon of excess bacteria.   Udo Erasmus told me<BR>
that Flaxseed was gentler on the colon due to the mucilage.<BR>

I agree with Brad, that Flaxseed should have a pleasant nutty taste.  I've<BR>
never had a problem with flaxseed itself going rancid, but one of the problems<BR>
with flaxseed oil is that it has an extremely short shelf life and goes rancid<BR>
very quickly... which creates the &quot;fishy&quot; smell and flavor.<BR>
<BR>
In the first part of this century, flaxseed oil was actually a major staple<BR>
for cooking oil.  It was grown and milled locally and purchased by local<BR>
consumers on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis for each day's cooking.<BR>
<BR>
With the industrialization of processing cooking oil in huge quantites for a<BR>
national market, flaxseed was abandon and corn became the &quot;new&quot; cooking oil of<BR>
choice.  Corn oil can withstand the extreme temperatures of modern processing,<BR>
can be processed in huge batches and has an indefinite shelf life.  Flaxseed<BR>
became unviable economically and was therefore abandon as a staple crop and<BR>
has slipped into realitve obscurity.<BR>
<BR>
Just some trivia for those who might be interested.<BR>

Sounds like my flax seeds were rancid. They tasted and smelled fishy, they were<BR>
sealed in a foil vacuumed package with a far off expiration date.  They also cost<BR>
me a fortune.<BR>
At approximately $11.00 for a pound I should have returned them for a refund .<BR>

Yes, they were probably rancid.   They ought to taste kinda like<BR>
bran and nuts mixed together.   I've been using them to make a <BR>
replacement for bran muffins that's reasonably good. :)<BR>

I get mine in the bulk section of Fred Meyer for 89cents/lb!  They<BR>
go on sale fairly often for 69cents/lb.   Or the health food store<BR>

Dear Christy Ann,<BR>
Did you miss last week's post about flax seeds not being allowed? Rachel<BR>
took the time to ask Elaine about them, and the answer was a definite NOT<BR>
allowed. She said one tsp of the oil per day is OK.  <BR>

OK, I know we had a long thread before on flax seed.  Seeds are<BR>
allowed to be cautiously added to the diet after a while, but someone<BR>
said that Elaine said that whole flax seed is too rough on our guts. <BR>
She did say that the oil should be OK, though.  I understand that a<BR>
common way to prepare flaxseed is to soak the seeds: the soluble fiber<BR>
in flaxseed, when combined with liquid, forms this mucousy-looking,<BR>
mucilaginous goo, then the seeds can be discarded and the goo used as<BR>
a dietary fiber supplement.  I hear that strict vegans use flaxseed<BR>
goo in place of eggs in baked goods!<BR>
<BR>
Well, my DH brought home a new product from the health-food store. <BR>
It's from Arrowhead Mills (anyone who has hung around health-food<BR>
stores as much as we do would be familiar with Arrowhead Mills).  This<BR>
item is called &quot;Nutri-Flax&quot; Certified Organic Flax Seed Powder.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, here's what the label says:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ingredients: Certified organic, partially defatted, gluten-free Flax<BR>
Seed Powder.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Directions: Mix one level tablespoon in a glass of water and drink<BR>
immediately.  Take two tablespoons of powder per day.  Nutri-Flax is<BR>
safe for everyday use.  Nutri-Flax is a gluten free product with a<BR>
delightful nutty taste and is a suitable replacement for bran or wheat<BR>
germ.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;DO NOT SWALLOW IN DRY FORM!  Always mix with liquid.  When dietary<BR>
fiber intake is increased, fluid intake should be increased to 8 to 10<BR>
glasses daily.  Eight 10 oz. glasses of water equals 80 oz. per day.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The flax seed powder in Nutri-Flax is certified 100% organic, grown<BR>
without the use of chemicals or pesticides.  Nutri-Flax is free of<BR>
artificial fillers, sugars, flavors, colors, additives or<BR>
preservatives.  Flax is known for its Omega-3 content, 540 mg of<BR>
Omega-3 per serving.  Nutri-Flax is high in dietary fiber and contains<BR>
1 g of soluble fiber per serving (see nutritional panel for more<BR>
information) including the family of water soluble fiber found in oat<BR>
bran.  The friendly bulk regulating properties of Nutri-Flax result<BR>
from its exceptionally high dietary fiber content (3 g/serving) and<BR>
its water absorbing mucilage (1.5 g/serving).  Nutri-Flax contains 27<BR>
mg/serving of lignans.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
...So, what think ye-all?<BR>
