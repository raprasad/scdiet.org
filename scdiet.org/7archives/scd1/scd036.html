<P>Hi Sanford,  I have been on the scd since august '97 and also
experienced very
low energy since then.  I found that I was not actually eating enough
food,
period, but also, not enough carbos because of all the scd restrictions.
Two
weeks ago, I was consulting with an acupuncturist about other issues and
she
suggested I see a naturopath she recommended due to that person's
expertise on
&quot;The Zone&quot; diet. The &quot;Zone&quot; is a carefully
calibrated food program in which
you make sure that each meal has a particular and consistent balance
among
carbos, protein and fat/other.  Her only reason for suggesting I look at
it is
to make sure my scd meals have that important balance. I found the
naturopath's advice very helpful and have been measuring my legal scd
foods
for each meal since and can already tell a difference in my energy, even
tho'
I still have digestive symptoms.  


<P>A very quick run-down of the program is that you need to make each
meal
consist of 40% carbos, 30%protein and no more than 30%fat/other (i.e.
like
tomatoes, lettuce and scd-mayo on a &quot;sandwich&quot;). A
&quot;standard&quot; meal is what is
called a &quot;3-block&quot; meal: you eat 3 blocks of carbo, 3 of
protein and 3 of
fat/other (there are restrictions on how much of fat/other is fat rather
than
other, naturally!)  A &quot;block&quot; is equal to 9 grams of carbo,
which seems to
usually come close to abt 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 cup of any given legal
vegetable, and
abt. 1-11/2 oz of protein (i.e.meat/fish), or 7 grams of protein.  The
&quot;fat&quot;
part usually is given as abt 1/3 tsp for one block.  So you can figure
that a
3 block meal is abt 3-4 cups of veges and 3-4.5 oz of protein with the
allowed
1 tsp of fat.  But on the scd, since we get no complex carbos or
processed
foods, I let myself have more fat than that and I'm now maintaining my
historical set point of weight.  I also mix my veges so I don't have to
eat
3-4 cups of the same veg. at one meal.


<P>You might want to pick up the book just to flip through it or, ask
around for
a naturopath or dietician/ nutritionist who know the &quot;Zone&quot;
well and can help
you balance your intake.  It's still early days on this
&quot;block&quot; plan for me,
but using it and the scd seems to slowly be building my energy.  (I also
only
eat cooked foods, no raw fruit, veges or nuts and no yogurt yet).   
Good
luck,     &nbsp; Liz

<P>Jane, 

<P>My husband and I have both experienced very low levels of energy (me
when I
was pregnant) and couldn't seem to find anything that would help.  Then
we
were introduced to liquid minerals marketed by Equinox International. 
We had
tried other minerals to no avail, but this stuff really helped a lot! 
My baby
became more active in the womb (actually did not stop moving for about 3
days)
and I got a little concerned.  I talked to my doc and he said that was
fine, I
probably was needing those minerals.  Needless to say, I got the energy
I
needed to carry me through the third trimester.  My husband has been up
and
down due to UC, but the minerals also help to boost his energy.


<P>We did become representatives to market this product along with their
other
fine products, but that is not why I am telling you about it.  It
matters not
to me whether you decide to take it or not, I'm just sharing my own
experience.


<P>Val
