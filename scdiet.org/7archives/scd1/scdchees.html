<P>Primitive forms of cheese have been made since humans started
domesticating animals. <BR>
No one knows exactly who made the first cheese, but, according 
to one ancient legend, it was made accidentally by an Arabian 
merchant crossing the desert. The merchant put his drinking 
milk in a bag made from a sheep's stomach. The natural rennin 
in the lining of the pouch, along with the heat from the sun, 
caused the milk to coagulate and then separate into curds and 
whey. At nightfall, the whey satisfied the man's thirst, and 
the curd (cheese) had a delightful flavour and satisfied his 
hunger.
<P>From its birthplace in the Middle East, cheese making spread 
as far as England with the expansion of the Roman Empire. During 
the Middle Ages, monks and merchants of Europe made cheese an 
established food of that area. In 1620, cheese and cows were 
part of the ship's stores carried to North America by the Pilgrims 
on the Mayflower. Until the middle of the 19th century, 
cheese was a local farm product. Few, if any, distinct varieties 
of cheese were developed deliberately. Rather, cheese makers 
in each locality made a cheese that, when ripened under specific 
conditions of air temperature and humidity, mold, and milk source, 
acquired certain characteristics of its own. Different varieties 
appeared largely as a result of accidental changes or modifications 
in one or more steps of the cheese-making process. Because there 
was little understanding of the bacteriology and chemistry involved, 
these changes were little understood and difficult to duplicate. 
Cheese making was an art, and the process was a closely guarded 
secret that was passed down from one generation to the next.
<P> With increasing scientific knowledge came a greater understanding 
of the bacteriological and chemical changes that are necessary 
to produce many types of cheese. Thus, it has become possible 
to control more precisely each step in the cheese-making process 
and to manufacture a more uniform product. Cheese making is 
now a science as well as an art.<P>


<B><P>Fundamentals of cheese making.</B>
<P>Figure 30
<P>The cheese-making process consists of removing a major part of the water
contained in fresh fluid milk
while retaining most of the solids. Since storage life 
increases as water content decreases, cheese making can also 
be considered a form of food preservation through the process 
of milk fermentation. The fermentation of milk into finished cheese
requires several essential steps: preparing and inoculating 
the milk with lactic-acid-producing bacteria, curdling the milk, 
cutting the curd, shrinking the curd (by cooking), draining 
or dipping the whey, salting, pressing, and ripening. These 
steps, which are illustrated in Figure 30, begin with
four basic ingredients: milk, microorganisms, rennet, and salt.

<P><B>Inoculation and curdling.</B>
<P>Milk for cheese making must be of the highest quality. Because the 
natural microflora present in milk frequently include undesirable 
types called psychrophiles, good farm sanitation and pasteurization 
or partial heat treatment are important to the cheese-making 
process. In addition, the milk must be free of substances that 
may inhibit the growth of acid-forming bacteria (e.g., 
antibiotics and sanitizing agents). Milk is often 
pasteurized to destroy pathogenic microorganisms and to eliminate 
spoilage and defects induced by bacteria. However, since pasteurization 
destroys the natural enzymes found in milk, cheese produced 
from pasteurized milk ripens less rapidly and less extensively 
than most cheese made from raw or lightly heat-treated milk.
<P> During pasteurization, the milk may be passed through a standardizing 
separator to adjust the fat-to-protein ratio of the milk. In 
some cases the cheese yield is improved by concentrating protein 
in a process known as ultrafiltration. The milk is then inoculated 
with fermenting microorganisms and rennet, which promote curdling.
<P> The fermenting microorganisms carry out the anaerobic conversion of lactose
 to lactic acid. The type of organisms used depends on the variety 
of cheese and on the production process. Rennet is an enzymatic 
preparation that is usually obtained from the fourth stomach 
of calves. It contains a number of proteolytic (protein-degrading) 
enzymes, including rennin and pepsin. Some cheeses, such as 
cottage cheese and cream cheese, are produced by acid coagulation 
alone. In the presence of lactic acid, rennet, or both, the 
milk protein casein clumps together and precipitates out of solution; this 
is the process known as curdling, or coagulation. Coagulated 
casein assumes a solid or gellike structure (the 
curd), which traps most of the fat, bacteria, calcium, phosphate, 
and other particulates. The remaining liquid (the 
whey) contains water, proteins resistant to acidic and enzymatic 
denaturation (e.g., antibodies), carbohydrates (lactose), 
and minerals.
<P>Lactic acid produced by the starter culture organisms has several 
functions. It promotes curd formation by rennet (the activity 
of rennet requires an acidic pH), causes the curd to shrink, 
enhances whey drainage (syneresis), and helps prevent the growth 
of undesirable microorganisms during cheese making and ripening. 
In addition, acid affects the elasticity of the finished curd 
and promotes fusion of the curd into a solid mass. Enzymes released 
by the bacterial cells also influence flavour development during 
ripening.
<P><B> Salt </B>
is usually added to the curd. In addition to enhancing flavour, 
it helps to withdraw the whey from the curd and inhibits the 
growth of undesirable microorganisms.
<P><B> Cutting and shrinking.</B>
<P>After the curd is formed, it is cut with fine wire &quot;knives&quot; 
into small cubes approximately one centimetre (one-half inch) 
square. The curd is then gently heated, causing it to shrink. 
The degree of shrinkage determines the moisture content and 
the final consistency of the cheese. Whey is removed by draining 
or dipping. The whey may be further processed to make whey cheeses 
(e.g., ricotta) or beverages, or it may be dried in order 
to preserve it as a food ingredient.

<P><A NAME=ripening"></A>
<B> Ripening.</B>
<P>Most cheese is ripened for varying amounts of time in order to bring 
about the chemical changes necessary for transforming fresh 
curd into a distinctive aged cheese. These changes are catalyzed 
by enzymes from three main sources: rennet or other enzyme preparations 
of animal or vegetable origin added during coagulation, microorganisms 
that grow within the cheese or on its surface, and the cheese 
milk itself. The ripening time may be as short as one month, 
as for Brie, or a year or more, as in the case of sharp cheddar.
<P> The ripening of cheese is influenced by the interaction of 
bacteria, enzymes, and physical conditions in the curing room. 
The speed of the reactions is determined by temperature and 
humidity conditions in the room as well as by the moisture content 
of the cheese. In most cheeses lactose continues to be
fermented to lactic acid and lactates, or it is hydrolyzed to form other 
sugars. As a result, aged cheeses such as Emmentaler and cheddar 
have no residual lactose.
<P> In a similar manner, proteins and lipids
(fats) are broken down during ripening. The degree of protein decomposition, or 
proteolysis, affects both the flavour and the consistency of 
the final cheese. It is especially apparent in 
Limburger and some blue-mold ripened cheeses.
Surface-mold ripened cheeses, such as 
Brie, rely on enzymes produced by the white Penicillium camemberti 
mold to break down proteins from the outside. When lipids are 
broken down (as in Parmesan and Romano cheeses), the process is called 
lipolysis.
<P>The eyes, or holes, typical of Swiss-type cheeses such as 
Emmentaler and 
Gruy&egrave;re come from a secondary fermentation that takes 
place when, after two weeks, the cheeses are moved from refrigerated 
curing to a warmer room, where temperatures are in the range 
of 20&deg; to 24&deg; C (68&deg; to 75&deg; F). At this stage, residual lactates 
provide a suitable medium 
for propionic acid bacteria (Propionibacterium shermanii) 
to grow and generate carbon dioxide gas. Eye formation takes 
three to six weeks. Warm-room curing is stopped when the wheels 
develop a rounded surface and the echo of holes can be heard 
when the cheese is thumped. The cheese is then moved back to 
a cold room, where it is aged at about 7&deg; C (45&deg; F) for 4 to 
12 months in order to develop its typical sweet, nutty flavour.
<P>The unique ripening of blue-veined cheeses comes from the mold spores 
Penicillium roqueforti or P. glaucum, which are added to the milk or to the curds 
before pressing and are activated by air. Air is introduced 
by &quot;needling&quot; the cheese with a device that punches about 50 
small holes into the top. These air passages allow mold spores 
to grow vegetative cells and spread their greenish blue mycelia, 
or threadlike structures, through the cheese. Penicillium 
molds are also rich in proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes, so 
that during ripening a variety of trace compounds also are produced, 
such as free amines, amino acids, carbonyls, and fatty acids--all 
of which ultimately affect the flavour and texture of the
cheese. (see also Index: blue cheese ) 
<P> Surface-ripened cheeses such as Gruy&egrave;re, brick, Port Salut, and
Limburger derive their 
flavour from both internal ripening and the surface environment. 
For instance, the high-moisture wiping of the surface of Gruy&egrave;re 
gives that cheese a fuller flavour than its Emmentaler counterpart. 
Specific organisms, such as Brevibacterium linens, in 
Limburger cheese result in a reddish brown surface growth and 
the breakdown of protein to amino nitrogen. The resulting odour 
is offensive to some, but the flavour and texture of the cheese 
are pleasing to many. (see also Index: flavouring) 
<P> Not all cheeses are ripened. Cottage, cream, ricotta, and most 
mozzarella cheeses are ready for sale as soon as they are made. 
All these cheeses have sweet, delicate flavours and often are 
combined with other foods.
<P>
<P><B>Varieties of cheese.</B>
<P>As a result of the many combinations of milks, cultures, enzymes, 
molds, and technical processes, literally hundreds of varieties 
of cheese are made throughout the world. The different types 
of cheese can be classified in many ways; the most effective 
is probably according to hardness or ripening method. Table 
11 groups several varieties of cheese based on these criteria
<P> In recent years different types of cheese have been combined 
in order to increase variety and consumer interest. For example, 
soft and mildly flavoured Brie is combined with a more pungent 
semisoft cheese such as blue or Gorgonzola. The resulting 
<P>&quot;Blue-Brie&quot; has a bloomy white edible rind, while its interior 
is marbled with blue Penicillium roqueforti mold. The 
cheese is marketed under various names such as Bavarian Blue, 
Cambazola, Lymeswold, and Saga Blue. Another combination cheese 
is Norwegian Jarlsberg. This cheese results from a marriage of 
the cultures and manufacturing procedures for Dutch Gouda and 
Swiss Emmentaler.
<P>
<P><B>Pasteurized process cheese.</B>
<P>Some natural cheese is made into process cheese, a product in which 
complete ripening is halted by heat. The resulting product has 
an indefinite shelf life. Most process cheese is used in food 
service outlets and other applications where convenient, uniform 
melting is required.
<P> Pasteurized process cheese is made by grinding and mixing natural 
cheese with other ingredients, such as water, emulsifying agents, 
colouring, fruits, vegetables, or meat. The mixture is then 
heated to temperatures of 165&deg; F (74&deg; C) and stirred 
into a homogeneous, plastic mass. Process cheese foods, spreads, 
and products differ from process cheese in that they may contain 
other ingredients, such as nonfat dry milk, cheese whey, and 
whey protein concentrates, as well as additional amounts of 
water.
<P>American cheddar is processed most frequently. However, other cheeses
 such as washed-curd, Colby, Swiss, Gruy&egrave;re, and Limburger are similarly processed.
 In a slight variation, 
cold pack or club cheese is made by grinding and mixing together 
one or more varieties of cheese without heat. This cheese food 
may contain added flavours or ingredients. (D.K.B.) (see
