Sooooo, if Buckwheat is an herb, then why couldn't we who are on the SCD<BR>
eat it?  Does Elaine talk about this in the book?<BR>

&gt;I know this subject has been discussed before, but I was hoping someone<BR>
&gt;knows which beans are allowed on the SCD diet. The book says that dried<BR>
&gt;white beans and lentils are allowed, and that soybeans, mungbeans, faba<BR>
&gt;beans, and garbanzo beans are forbidden. What about all the others: kidney<BR>
&gt;beans, pinto beans, etc.?<BR>
&gt;<BR>

4 cups of zucchini instead of 3???? i made just this for the first time today<BR>
and i'll never make it again. they were the worst muffins i ever tasted. even<BR>
i could look at this recipe WHEN i was making it knowing there was too much<BR>
liquid. sure enough, there was. if i make it again, im adding more flour or<BR>
less zucchini.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha - would like to know how long you have been on the diet?<BR>

<BR>
Yes, i learned twice today that buckwheat is not a grain. however according<BR>
to the body ecology diet, buckwheat and amaranth are considered ALTERNATIVE<BR>
grains, so i apologize. <BR>
<BR>
and for the record - page 54:<BR>
<BR>
GRAINS NOT PERMITTED -  wheat, barley, corn, rye, oats, rice, BUCKWHEAT<BR>
<BR>
so i guess thats where i got it ( i dont make this stuff up - i usually get<BR>
it from someone else!)<BR>

<BR>
Less zucchini might be the better choice given your description.  Almond<BR>
flour is 50-60% oil so if you added more almond flour you would also be<BR>
adding oil.  Adding the flour might make it look &quot;right&quot; when you made the<BR>
batter, but the oil would come out as it baked.<BR>

&gt; I joined this list a few days ago -- what a find! (Can I get a digest<BR>
&gt; version? I tried &quot;set digest&quot; to no avail.) <BR>
<BR>
I can't get digest version either...I tried.  I think we all have problems with our <BR>
digestion, and that's why we're here!  *JOKE* HA HA (HAs anyone sucessfully set <BR>
up the digest version? or were there only problems at the beginning, as I haven't <BR>
tried since my first unsucessful attempt).<BR>
<BR>
I'm the only person I know<BR>
&gt; on this diet (on since last Christmas), so it's really nice to talk to<BR>
&gt; you guys.  I tell my friends that I'm on the Woody Allen &quot;Sleeper&quot; diet<BR>
&gt; -- I can have bacon and eggs, but no whole wheat bread!  Actually, I<BR>
&gt; usually prefer not to engage in discussion of my strange new eating<BR>
&gt; habits, but cannot always avoid it.  Just saying no when people offer me<BR>
&gt; food usually works, but not always. What do other people say gracefully?<BR>
<BR>
I just say that I'm sick, and by avoiding complex carbos I alleviate my symptoms, <BR>
and am slowly getting better (this usually leads to a &quot;Wow, no grain? no sugar? <BR>
no milk?  That's insane, what's left?  To which I respond the usual - fruit, veg, <BR>
meat, etc.  I like the &quot;Sleeper&quot; line!)<BR>

I too love the sleeper line!  I'm still wrestling with the &quot;what to say&quot;<BR>
issue.  I started out telling waiters that I'm on a medically restricted diet<BR>
but then worried that they might construe that to be a conventional low salt<BR>
or low fat diet where getting what you shouldn't have is less of an issue<BR>
than with this diet.  Lately, I've tried telling waiters that I have<BR>
significant food allergies and that is why I really need my food served with<BR>
nothing added.  I'm thinking this gets across the idea that I might have an<BR>
immediate and negative reaction to even a little bit of the offending item<BR>
(and they wouldn't want that to happen in their restaurant!)<BR>
<BR>
With my friends/colleagues/customers who know I have crohns, it's an easy<BR>
thing.  I just tell them that I've finally found a diet regimen that is<BR>
making me feel better and they are thrilled for me.<BR>
<BR>
What I am still wrestling with is how to deal with this on a first date with<BR>
someone.  I'm assuming that if I order plain grilled salmon with steamed<BR>
vegetables and decline bread and dessert, they will just think that I'm<BR>
either on a weight loss diet or a healthy heart diet and won't find it too<BR>
unusual.  (I'll just skip the part where I usually tell the waiter they can<BR>
put butter on my food, just nothing else!)  I tend to be very open and matter<BR>
of fact about my illness.  I guess I've been forced to be because for the<BR>
last 2.5 years it's been pretty obvious that something was wrong with me.<BR>
 I've been dating people whom I already knew during the time I was so ill, so<BR>
I never had to explain to someone in a dating context.  Now it's no longer<BR>
obvious that I'm ill.  Telling them too soon seems inappropriate and waiting<BR>
too long to tell them seems inappropriate too.  Has anyone developed some<BR>
personal rules of thumb on this?  (My approach--telling people I'm on haitus<BR>
from dating--isn't a long term solution! ;-)<BR>

yes, 4 cs of zucchini instead of 3 ...but...I add additional flour just by<BR>
looking at the mixture until it gets to the consistency I want...since I<BR>
have lots of pecan flour I don't use as much as the almond flour I ordered<BR>
at the same time, I use the pecan flour as my &quot;adding flour&quot; and it makes a<BR>
wonderful zucchini muffin.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, I didn't mention adding more flour.<BR>

Whether single or not (which I am), I think it depends on my attitude about<BR>
my diet the extent to which other people get &quot;charged&quot; &quot;inefficient&quot; , etc.<BR>
If I am okay, not embarrassed with it, and relaxes,  I find &quot;they&quot; are okay<BR>
and accommodating.  I get extremely specific in restaurants and find the<BR>
better the restaurant, the less mix-ups!  So, I don't go to fast food<BR>
places and expect to have the accommodations that I do in a little better<BR>
restaurant.  I find Italian places pretty good for olive oil brushed salmon<BR>
and veggies either baked or sauteed in olive oil.  I even get specific<BR>
about asking which veggies they have, explaining that I can't eat onion,<BR>
stringed beans or peas, etc. If the person I am with,should have a problem<BR>
with this, He (she) is not the kind of person I would want to spend time<BR>
with and would get qualified in a hurry!  So far, my &quot;date&quot; has been<BR>
absolutely okay with my diet...I find I worry about it more than others do,<BR>
anyway!<BR>

Dear Ellen -<BR>
<BR>
thanx for your advice. will use less zucchini next time and see how it goes.<BR>
i would like to know what everyone highly recommends as a yogurt starter. i<BR>
wrote once and got an answer and i think they said use yogurt. well, if im<BR>
going to use yogurt itself as a starter, im not going to bother making it. i<BR>
know you guys know what to use and whats allowed and would like to know where<BR>
to find what you recommend and what the ingredients are.<BR>
<BR>
yea, as far as waiters go, i dont say, i dont WANT rice. i tell them i CANT<BR>
HAVE rice so please leave it off. the boyfriend thing could be a little<BR>
difficult. like you said saying something too early doesnt seem right and<BR>
telling them something too late doesnt either. i just say be honest right<BR>
from the get go in case it DOES lead to something. dessert? no, not good for<BR>
me. doesnt agree with me if it has to come to that. if they ask what happens,<BR>
ask them if they want to find out!<BR>

I have had UC for 16 years.  Needless to say my eating habits were terrible.<BR>
 I was frequently called the sugar kid.  I lived on fast food, and all the<BR>
&quot;illegal&quot; foods were part of my daily regeme. I am happy to report that I<BR>
have been on the diet for 10 months and I feel really good. I must admit<BR>
there have been several setbacks, but I have all the confidence in this diet.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway,  I have had regular colonoscopies for the past 16 years and quite<BR>
frankly I am sick of it.  I dont think that the doctors know anything because<BR>
all they try to do is cover up my sickness with medicines, and tell me they<BR>
dont know why I am sick. <BR>

I was wondering if anyone knows of ANY alternatives to a colonoscopy.  Are<BR>

<BR>
Hi,<BR>
<BR>
Have any of you ever heard of or experienced respiratory problems as a<BR>
result of IBD? Our 12 year old son was diagnossed with CD earlier this<BR>
year. He was put on a low dose of prednisone briefly, and we have been on<BR>
the diet since shortly after he tapered off it. He has had coughs and/or<BR>
nasal congestion almost all year, except while he was on pred. My wife has<BR>
always thought that it was related to his gut problem. I, on the other hand<BR>
was of the opinion that it could be completely unrelated. It has persisted<BR>
for a very long time though, and I now think that she must be right. I put<BR>
out a feeler or two a long time ago about this (not on this list), and<BR>
didn't come up with much. The Dr., of course, has little or nothing to say<BR>
abot it. His pediatrician did prescribe two inhalers for him...thinking he<BR>
might have asthma. This was back before the CD diagnossis, and I think they<BR>
helped the cough a bit. Like always though, they just treat the symptom,<BR>
and do nothing at all about the cause.<BR>
<BR>
With this exception, the SCD seems to be doing great things for him. He's<BR>
gaining weight and height (he had been loosing ground). The joint pain is<BR>

does go to the bathroom a little more often than his friends (3 or 4 times<BR>
a day), but nothing like we've read about here, and his stools are formed<BR>
and healthy looking. Actually, according to what my wife has been reading,<BR>
three or four trips a day to the throne is what we should all be doing,<BR>

Dear Steve,<BR>
Sorry but I don't know of respitory distress being part of IBD, but this is<BR>
a whole auto immune ball of wax, so nothing would surprise me. Maybe your<BR>
son has allergies. Have you checked this possibility out? I'm glad his gut<BR>

With UC, you still should go one a year to mae sure you aren't<BR>
developing colon cancer, which supposedly has a higher incidence in<BR>
people with UC.  Unfortunately, there's no alternative I can think of,<BR>

&gt; I have had UC for 16 years.  Needless to say my eating habits were<BR>
&gt; terrible.<BR>
&gt;  I was frequently called the sugar kid.  I lived on fast food, and all<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &quot;illegal&quot; foods were part of my daily regeme. I am happy to report<BR>
&gt; that I<BR>
&gt; have been on the diet for 10 months and I feel really good. I must<BR>
&gt; admit<BR>
&gt; there have been several setbacks, but I have all the confidence in<BR>
&gt; this diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Anyway,  I have had regular colonoscopies for the past 16 years and<BR>
&gt; quite<BR>
&gt; frankly I am sick of it.  I dont think that the doctors know anything<BR>
&gt; because<BR>
&gt; all they try to do is cover up my sickness with medicines, and tell me<BR>
&gt; they<BR>
&gt; dont know why I am sick.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knows of ANY alternatives to a colonoscopy.<BR>
&gt; Are<BR>

&gt; yes, buckwheat is a grain and an acidic one at that. since the diet is<BR>
&gt; a<BR>
&gt; specific one, we need to stay in the parameters. since your not fixed<BR>

&gt;<BR>
<BR>
No need to say your sorry: my disease, my responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
With your logic, many of us, even Racheal, can't even recommend the<BR>
SCD.  Her experience was positive, but she and many other of the<BR>
&quot;healed&quot; still have other problems.  My experience so far was positive<BR>
on the modified diet.  The bottom line is that we don't have a solid<BR>
proven theory on why it works, and we don't know if there are any long<BR>
term problems with the diet.I did explain that millet and buckwheat are<BR>
not on the diet.  Can someone answer me this?  Do we know that grains<BR>
are irritating?  I have a feeling that this something like a wive's<BR>
tale.  I would say that wheat is definitely irritating -- probably the<BR>
gluten.  Oats have lots of shells and stuff.  Most people can't digest<BR>
corn.<BR>
<BR>
So what is exactly the irritating part of grains and do all grains have<BR>
this problem?  I still think its probably just the &quot;staple&quot; grains that<BR>
are the irritating grains, so people just carried over to _all_ grains.<BR>
I am willing, however, to eliminate them just in case.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; grains are causing problems, the body knows when we take it ALL away<BR>
&gt; that it<BR>
&gt; isnt getting the very things that irritate it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; yes, wanting to be well is a committment. some people have time to<BR>
&gt; waste. i<BR>
&gt; dont. its everyones individual decision and committment but in case<BR>
&gt; Liz was<BR>
&gt; committed, she needed to know what was real and since this is about<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; specific carbohydrate diet, eventually it wont be if we give advice<BR>
&gt; straying<BR>
&gt; away from the very content.<BR>
<BR>
If I may say publicly, I do feel a little uncomfortable about my last<BR>
posts concerning straying from the diet.   I'll explain myself better in<BR>
the future, but frankly, the &quot;do it or die&quot; attitude of many of the<BR>
people of this list is not necessarily the most supportive.  It's scary,<BR>
it sounds radical -- I bet we lose people over it.  Anyway, I'll keep it<BR>
off the public areas.<BR>
<BR>
Over the past 5 days I've eliminated both the millet and buckwheat.<BR>
After adding vegetables in large enough quantities -- 2-3 pounds a day,<BR>
I felt it wasn't necessary.  So after a month or so on the modified<BR>
diet, I'm satisfied that it did what it was supposed to do -- eliminate<BR>
prednesone and get me on the SCD.  Now I'm ready to make some bigger<BR>
gains, so I'm going to drop the grains completely.<BR>
<BR>
Millet and buckwheat are suitable on most candida control diets.  My<BR>
opinion is that if you have to ease into SCD, you have to at least<BR>
follow a candida diet -- I don't think you'll get very far eating<BR>
potatoes and rice -- I know I never did.<BR>
<BR>
My logic says (correct me more experienced people) that the SCD<BR>
eliminates many/most of the irritants and causes of inflammation -- and<BR>
this is the only way we will be successful in cleansing and healing.  So<BR>
if you just _can't_ eliminate everything on the diet at first and you<BR>
have time to continue to allow yourself to be sick, then do it in<BR>
stages.  I believe the real results will come with the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
There is a health food store nearby my home.  Its name is &quot;Health by<BR>
Choice.&quot;  A name with a message.  We do have a choice, and what I think<BR>
is incredible is that it really is a difficult choice to make.  It took<BR>
me 3 years to make the right choice, and after 3 more years, I'm still<BR>
struggling.<BR>

This has to be your personal choice, but you do have the choice to not<BR>
have the scope.  The standard screening for cancer is an &quot;ocult blood&quot;<BR>
feces test (something like that).  I'm not sure how accurate it is, and<BR>
I don't know how early it detects cancers.  You may not be able to use<BR>
it because you probably still have blood in your feces.   You will<BR>
probably have to find a doctor who respects your rights before you can<BR>
even discuss this option, but I would think it would be a likely, albeit<BR>
risky, way to quit the scoping.  Frankly, I doubt any mainstream doctor<BR>
would talk to you about it.<BR>

I don't have any official background which qualifies me to comment, but here<BR>
goes.  My CD causes nasal and lung congestion in me on a regular basis.  When<BR>
the CD flares, I get congested.  The sensation is as though I'm starting to<BR>
come down with something but then it clears up.  It could be a side effect of<BR>
the CD, or it could be a reaction to a food that triggers both the CD and the<BR>
congestion.  An ELISA test could show which foods your son would have an<BR>
immune response to.  Also, I would think, that this could be a histamine<BR>
reaction indicative of an allergy of some kind.  Again some testing might<BR>
clarify that.  It can be a common response to dairy, but given that your son<BR>
is still a child you might not want to experiment with eliminating it.  The<BR>
testing might be the most informative option and then you could take it from<BR>
there.<BR>

My guess, it that someone made a mistake, and probably won't ever admit<BR>

not.  We really don't know why the diet works, so I guess we'll never<BR>
know.  I guess &quot;use at your own risk&quot; is the policy here.<BR>
<BR>
If it is &quot;acid forming&quot;, as someone said, then common theories say that<BR>
is not a good thing for the health of the body, and will also contribute<BR>
to candiasis.  I personally don't wholeheartely subscribe to the<BR>
acid/alkaline forming foods theory, but it is interesting that all the<BR>
foods that are thought alkaline are considered good for us.  Meat, BTW,<BR>
is acid forming.<BR>

&gt; matter<BR>
&gt; of fact about my illness.  I guess I've been forced to be because for<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; last 2.5 years it's been pretty obvious that something was wrong with<BR>
&gt; me.<BR>
&gt;  I've been dating people whom I already knew during the time I was so<BR>
&gt; ill, so<BR>
&gt; I never had to explain to someone in a dating context.  Now it's no<BR>
&gt; longer<BR>
&gt; obvious that I'm ill.  Telling them too soon seems inappropriate and<BR>
&gt; waiting<BR>
&gt; too long to tell them seems inappropriate too.  Has anyone developed<BR>
&gt; some<BR>
&gt; personal rules of thumb on this?  (My approach--telling people I'm on<BR>
&gt; haitus<BR>
&gt; from dating--isn't a long term solution! ;-)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Damn, I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  I was given a phone<BR>
number about a month ago and was in the middle of a flare.  Nights were<BR>
my worst time so dating without honesty would be extremely tough.  Add<BR>
to that a blind date.<BR>
<BR>
What I worry about is the whole issue of willpower.  Every woman I know<BR>
is trying to lose weight or at least watching their weight (usually<BR>
watching it go up!).  So I show this so-call incredible willpower and<BR>
they're so embarrased that they can't stay away from a simple pat of<BR>
butter on their bland baked potato.  (Do they even realize that I don't<BR>
eat potatoes either? Aaahh!).<BR>
<BR>
I'm thinking that I just have to hook them in for a couple of dates, and<BR>
then come out and be honest.  What about &quot;dinner and movie&quot; without the<BR>
dinner?  For alcohol, I think vodka is allowed (better check the book)<BR>
so wouldn't screwdrivers be a good drink -- and hell, it's almost cool<BR>
not to drink these days, so that probably isn't a concern.  These ideas,<BR>
unfortuneately, haven't been tried.  Most first dates are in periods of<BR>
remission for me (no symptoms at all) so I don't have any immediate need<BR>
to tell all, but I've always come clean after a few dates.<BR>
<BR>
This possible blind date is with a nurse, and this particulary scares<BR>
me.  Will she want to take care of me -- that I definitely don't want.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I haven't had a date in over 1 1/2 years (I'm 30, BTW).<BR>

Hi Y'all-<BR>
<BR>
I just bought a Foley's Food Mill to remove the skins of beans.  There was<BR>
a recent discussion on how the skins can cause irritation in some people,<BR>
and I'm hoping this will help me better tolerate beans since they are a<BR>
good source of carbos as well as protein.<BR>
<BR>
Question:  This may seem obvious, but do you put the beans through the mill<BR>
just after soaking, or after cooking?  When I put them through after<BR>
cooking, the result is a paste.<BR>
<BR>
Question:  I also noticed that there were still small pieces of skin in the<BR>
resulting paste.  Is this normal?<BR>
<BR>
I bought mine from the housewares section of a local hardware store and it<BR>
cost about $30US.<BR>

Steve, <BR>
I myself have had respiratory problems.  They cleared up tremedously<BR>
with the SCD but I still have bouts of congestion, especially in the<BR>
morning.  I can often tie it in with my digestive health too.  <BR>
<BR>
The only explanation I have found comes from Chinese Medicine.  I can't<BR>
do the official explanation justice because I can't talk in chinese<BR>
metaphors the way they do, but they have explanations about how<BR>
&quot;dampness&quot; from the intestines can affect the lungs, the sinuses, and<BR>
such.  <BR>
<BR>
I've used herbal preparations for this that help my sinuses, and they<BR>
also go a long way, at the same time, to help with muscle aches I also<BR>
get associated to my intestinal health and leaky gut.  I don't know if<BR>
this helps out, but I found it helpful when I disovered it.  However,<BR>
beyond going to a Chinese doctor, I really believe that eventually, with<BR>
the SCD, the problems should eventually go away. My personal experience<BR>
is that the gut is still healing for quite a while after one no longer<BR>
has any diarrhea.  Glad to hear your son is doing so well on the diet!<BR>

carbohydrates, which stay in the intestines longer to be digested and<BR>
thus provide more food for the bacteria that put the bowel flora out of<BR>
balance, which leads to inflamation and so on.  I just wanted to<BR>
emphasize that because it's quite a bit more than an ol' wives tale.  By<BR>
adding grains, even like buckwheat and millet, you are running the risk<BR>
of providing food for those bacteria that make you ill.  It's not just<BR>
about gluten and such (unless you are one of those people who are<BR>
sensitive to gluten.)  It's not that grains are irritating, but that<BR>
they are made up of complex carbohydrates.  Only simple sugars are<BR>
allowed on the diet because they are digested quickly and thoroughly,<BR>
even by people with compromised intestinal health.  It seems to me that<BR>
the original premise what that they tried to create a diet that came as<BR>
close as possible to immitating with solid food the hospital synthetic<BR>
elemental diet.  That's where it was discovered that people with the<BR>
likes of UC were getting well, but then when they ate regular food, they<BR>
got sick again.  So the SCD comes close to that.<BR>
<BR>
Denise<BR>
<BR>
&gt; not on the diet.  Can someone answer me this?  Do we know that grains<BR>
&gt; are irritating?  I have a feeling that this something like a wive's<BR>
&gt; tale.<BR>

I just found out recently that there is an easy blood test they can do<BR>
to screen for cancer.  It is called AMAS.  Any physician qualified to<BR>
order lab tests can order it through Onco Lab, 1-800-922-8378.  I just<BR>
heard about it because of friend of mine has breast cancer and she has<BR>
been learning a lot about the cutting edge stuff they can do now. <BR>
Apparently this test (which supposedly costs about $135) is a future<BR>
replacement for the yearly mammograms many women have.  It is highly<BR>
accurate and there are no false positive results.  I don't see why it<BR>
wouldn't work for colon cancer as well.  <BR>

&gt; Hi Liz,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I am not tolerating fruit either and have had problems tolerating dairy in<BR>
&gt; the past; however, I can eat the 36-hour fermented yogurt we make from the<BR>
&gt; recipe in the book (Elaine says to ferment for 24 hours); and something I<BR>
&gt; do that you might want to experiment with in order to get those carbs for<BR>
&gt; breakfast is to make the Zucchini muffins and I put about 4 cups of grated<BR>
&gt; zucchini into the recipe rather than 3; also the carrot cake recipe, make<BR>
&gt; it into muffins and add a few more shredded carrots to it.  I love these<BR>
&gt; for breakfast.  Also, I make the cheesecake and eat it for breakfast or<BR>
&gt; snacks.  I feel the dry curd cottage cheese which has less than l/2 of 1<BR>
&gt; per cent of lactose in it, is well tolerated by me.  I mix it with the<BR>
&gt; yogurt and eat it just about every morning for breakfast.  Try these and<BR>
&gt; see what happens.  I'm still not on nuts, or raw anything, so I do have<BR>

Hi Kim,<BR>
<BR>
I did try the SCD yoghurt (36-hour fermentation).  I noted my bad<BR>
reaction in another post.<BR>
<BR>
I did make some beans yesterday (as per SCD), and I seemed to tolerate<BR>
those quite well, so that's encouraging.  I really like beans anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks/Liz<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I sympathize, Liz.  I've been having the same problem.  One thing I want to<BR>
&gt; ask:  have you tried yogurt made per the instructions for the SCD?  I have<BR>
&gt; found that I tolerate it well even though I don't normally do well with<BR>
&gt; dairy.  This could be true if your intolerance is for lactose.  It still<BR>
&gt; doesn't solve the carbo problem, but it can be another option.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, if you tolerate beans, they are a good source of carbos.  There has<BR>
&gt; been some discussion lately on the list about using a food mill to remove<BR>
&gt; the skins which are sometimes a source of problems for people.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The initial period on the diet is hard, but look on it as an experiment for<BR>
&gt; 2 weeks to see what happens.  Even if you are not getting enough carbos for<BR>
&gt; that period, you will probably be OK.  It will at least let you know if the<BR>
&gt; approach works for you.<BR>

&gt; Hi Y'all-<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I just bought a Foley's Food Mill to remove the skins of beans.  There<BR>
was<BR>
&gt; a recent discussion on how the skins can cause irritation in some people,<BR>
&gt; and I'm hoping this will help me better tolerate beans since they are a<BR>
&gt; good source of carbos as well as protein.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Question:  This may seem obvious, but do you put the beans through the<BR>
mill<BR>
&gt; just after soaking, or after cooking?  When I put them through after<BR>
&gt; cooking, the result is a paste.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Question:  I also noticed that there were still small pieces of skin in<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; resulting paste.  Is this normal?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I bought mine from the housewares section of a local hardware store and<BR>
it<BR>
&gt; cost about $30US.<BR>

Dear JP,<BR>
I was diagnosed in 1980 with UC, so like you I have had my fair share of<BR>
scoping. The last GI doctor I went to told me that during the first 10<BR>
years you are at no greater risk of getting colon cancer than anyone else.<BR>
Then with each 10 years that passes your risk goes up a bit. I was told to<BR>
have a colonoscopy every 2 years, and I'm in my 2nd decade.  When I was in<BR>
my first decade at basically no risk, the doctor I had wanted me in every<BR>
year. <BR>
I know what you are going through, I haven't been back for almost 3 years<BR>
and it's been on the back of my mind lately.<BR>

&gt; I have had UC for 16 years.  Needless to say my eating habits were<BR>
terrible.<BR>
&gt;  I was frequently called the sugar kid.  I lived on fast food, and all<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; &quot;illegal&quot; foods were part of my daily regeme. I am happy to report that I<BR>
&gt; have been on the diet for 10 months and I feel really good. I must admit<BR>
&gt; there have been several setbacks, but I have all the confidence in this<BR>
diet.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Anyway,  I have had regular colonoscopies for the past 16 years and quite<BR>
&gt; frankly I am sick of it.  I dont think that the doctors know anything<BR>
because<BR>
&gt; all they try to do is cover up my sickness with medicines, and tell me<BR>
they<BR>
&gt; dont know why I am sick. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knows of ANY alternatives to a colonoscopy. <BR>
Are<BR>
&gt; there any home tests that I can do?  I am really so not looking forward<BR>
to<BR>
&gt; seeing my doctor again. <BR>
&gt; <BR>

        I, too, have developed respiratory problems (diagnosed with CD  a=<BR>

UC 1985).  After too many awful and invasive tests (I have some permanent=<BR>

is one.  =<BR>
<BR>

nd<BR>
say one-third of the time it just is there, one-third it goes away, and<BR>
one-third it grows until you need a lung transplant -- very encouraging. =<BR>

Anyway, mine seem to come and go.  My family physician prescribed a<BR>

I<BR>
really need something crunchy.  And something to put butter on would be<BR>

&gt;        Anyway, as to the breathing problems, I'm also returning to yoga.<BR>
&gt;Even if it did nothing else, it promotes good breathing habits.<BR>
<BR>
Dear Marlena, (what a pretty name)<BR>
So glad you are going to do yoga. As an avid martial arts practitioner, I<BR>
know the importance of stretching &amp; breathing exersices. Besides good<BR>
breathing habits, I'm sure that you will also experience a feeling of<BR>
well-being that all of us with chronic illnesses sorely need. Much luck.<BR>

At least we wouldn't have to worry about how the other person would deal with<BR>

<BR>
I have a history of asthma and hay fever (running from spring 'til fall).  I have been <BR>
so weak in the fall that I have had pneumonia 3 times at that time.  I have had these <BR>
conditions for most of my life.  This all changed when I changed my foods.<BR>
<BR>
The MD that suggested the diet changes put me on an antihistamine.  He advised me to <BR>
remove allergens from my environment wherever possible.  That included an are cleaner in <BR>
my bedroom and not having animals around.  I made the changes simultaneously.<BR>
<BR>
Each year I was on the diet I needed the antihistamine less and now no longer use them <BR>
at all.  I used the air purifier the first year only.  I no longer have the symptoms <BR>
from spring 'til fall.<BR>
<BR>
Do I think the CD and these symptoms were related?  I absolutely believe they are.  I do <BR>
not think they are directly connected but more of an indirect nature.<BR>
<BR>
I believe that the bowel disorder was silent for many years but putting a drain on my <BR>
immune system.  I believe that an over taxed immune system leads to symptoms appearing <BR>
as the bodies defenses are weak.  <BR>
<BR>
I recall that there are several peak periods during the year for outbreaks of flare ups. <BR>
Two of them are during the spring and fall allergy season.  I know one man in our local <BR>
support group who had major flares in August 4 years in a row.  His wife thought that <BR>
was quite a coincidence.  The odds against this happening by chance are about 1 in <BR>
20,000.  <BR>

&gt; Hi,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Have any of you ever heard of or experienced respiratory problems as a<BR>
&gt; result of IBD? Our 12 year old son was diagnossed with CD earlier this<BR>
&gt; year. He was put on a low dose of prednisone briefly, and we have been on<BR>
&gt; the diet since shortly after he tapered off it. He has had coughs and/or<BR>
&gt; nasal congestion almost all year, except while he was on pred. My wife has<BR>
&gt; always thought that it was related to his gut problem. I, on the other hand<BR>
&gt; was of the opinion that it could be completely unrelated. It has persisted<BR>
&gt; for a very long time though, and I now think that she must be right. I put<BR>
&gt; out a feeler or two a long time ago about this (not on this list), and<BR>
&gt; didn't come up with much. The Dr., of course, has little or nothing to say<BR>
&gt; abot it. His pediatrician did prescribe two inhalers for him...thinking he<BR>
&gt; might have asthma. This was back before the CD diagnossis, and I think they<BR>
&gt; helped the cough a bit. Like always though, they just treat the symptom,<BR>
&gt; and do nothing at all about the cause.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; With this exception, the SCD seems to be doing great things for him. He's<BR>
&gt; gaining weight and height (he had been loosing ground). The joint pain is<BR>
&gt; almost not a problem anymore, though it hasn't completely gone away. He<BR>
&gt; does go to the bathroom a little more often than his friends (3 or 4 times<BR>
&gt; a day), but nothing like we've read about here, and his stools are formed<BR>
&gt; and healthy looking. Actually, according to what my wife has been reading,<BR>
&gt; three or four trips a day to the throne is what we should all be doing,<BR>
&gt; which is alright with me. I just wonder if maybe he's going more often and<BR>
&gt; tells us that so we won't be upset<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Health,<BR>
&gt; Steve<BR>

Hi Liz,<BR>
If I make mayonnaise with the raw egg, I put a little post-it on the lid<BR>
with the date on it. If it lasts more than about a week I throw it out. I<BR>
also don't use any eggs with a crack in the shell. So far I'm still alive!<BR>
There is a recipe for mayonnaise using a hard boiled egg on Mik's site<BR>
somewhere in the recipe section, if you are nervous about using a raw egg.<BR>

I was just thinking about the startup diet.  Is it possible to have<BR>

thinking this is a period of initial healing and cleansing and without it,<BR>
you're just not going to have same results if you just start off with<BR>
eating beans, all kinds of vegetables and nuts.   <BR>

&gt;I have a cheese snack recipe that works with almond <BR>
flour, that two <BR>
&gt;regular eaters asked me for -- it's good, though a <BR>
little greasy.  I <BR>
&gt;picked up a tip from this list already, to add less <BR>
oil when using <BR>
&gt;almond flour, and I will try that next time. Here <BR>
is the recipe with its <BR>
&gt;full oil allotment:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Cheese snacks      350 degrees for 15 minutes<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1/4 pound shredded cheddar cheese<BR>
&gt;1 cup almond flour<BR>
&gt;1/2 teaspoon salt<BR>
&gt;1/4 teaspoon sage (or fresh sage)<BR>
&gt;1/4 teaspoon thyme (or fresh thyme)<BR>
&gt;1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (really makes it good)<BR>
&gt;1/4 cup vegetable oil (you may try reducing this)<BR>
&gt;3 tbsp. cold water<BR>
&gt;coarse salt, sesame seeds or poppy seeds<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Add flour, salt, sage, thyme and cayenne pepper to <BR>
cheese.  Mix.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Add oil and water to cheese mixture.  Mix.  Form <BR>
into a ball and <BR>
&gt;refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;(Roll dough on a lightly powdered smooth flat <BR>
surface.  Sprinkle with <BR>
&gt;your choice of salt or seeds, and lightly roll <BR>
in.)*<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Cut into one 1/2 inch squares and place on cookie <BR>
sheet.  Bake 15 <BR>
&gt;minutes at 350 degrees.  Cool.  Makes two dozen <BR>
crackers.<BR>
&gt;---------------------------------------------------<BR>
-------------------<BR>
&gt;*I put this in parentheses, because although it's a <BR>
good idea, it makes <BR>
&gt;for much more stuff to clean up, and it's not <BR>
essential.  I've taken to <BR>
&gt;just forming small squares and going directly from <BR>
the bowl to the <BR>
&gt;cookie sheet. Then I sprinkle the sesame seeds, <BR>
which add a lot to the <BR>
&gt;texture of the cheese snacks.<BR>

Dear Steve -<BR>
<BR>
as far as i'm concerned EVERYTHING is a result of a gut problem. clean gut,<BR>
clean body. clean body = no sickness. what we take in thru this very tract is<BR>
the outcome of health or sickness. sounds like the SCD is proving it to you.<BR>
as far as allergies, they are only the result of an immune system breakdown.<BR>
a symptom. fix the gut, the allergies will go away. it would probably BE a<BR>
good idea to remove anything he is allergic to, to take the load off but in<BR>
the end, the allergies will be gone. it's definitely a process though.<BR>

I did as well. But I had just had a colonoscopy and was clean as a whistle.<BR>
The first thing I sent down to the colon was a cup of yorgurt, and made sure<BR>
to use more  of it   than  I normally would for the first few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Also wondering Bill, what are odds if you where on a blind date only to find<BR>
your date had Ulcerative Colitis? ..... Well it could happen.<BR>

I'm a 44 yr.old male w/ a 20 year history CD. With the exception of one<BR>
major flare-up 10 years ago, my symptoms were mild-modearte. I did not<BR>
take meds or have I had surgery.<BR>
<BR>
I've known about the SCD for some years now but only now am i willing to<BR>
give it a firm chance(having some flaring of late).<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the diet now for 10 days w/ mild improvement. HOWEVER, by<BR>
using the book FOOD and the gut reaction, by E. Gottshall, I began to<BR>
categorize food into two camps, the ALLOWED and the FORBIDDEN. Now after<BR>
reading the &quot;stuff &quot; in this web site, I realize there may be a better<BR>
way of STARTING out, that is, avoiding certain foods initially and maybe<BR>
even adding certain foods. <BR>
<BR>
I have yet to eat the homemade yogurt, as I am ignorant of the best way<BR>
to go about it.<BR>
<BR>
Also have been eating fruits and veggies and nut breads.  IN SHORT, I<BR>
need help especially in this initail crucial period, where probably<BR>
many  people &quot;fall away&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Please...I welcome all advice.<BR>
<BR>
In gratitude ,<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;971008100540_1464264528@emout04.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I didn't actually go through the start up diet. I started somewhere in the<BR>
middle and have had great benefits from the diet (over a month now).<BR>
<BR>
I believe the start up diet is for stopping the D. This was not a major<BR>
symptom of mine.  The way I started the diet was to consume only SCD legal<BR>
foods that were foods that I had already been eating on my low fiber diet.<BR>
 This was a broader range of foods than the startup diet, yet were foods I<BR>
was comfortable that I wouldn't have a bad reaction to.  I didn't add new<BR>
foods to my diet until after the inflammation and pain went away and even<BR>
then I am still pretty careful.  For example, I eat apples but only peeled<BR>
and cooked--not raw. In time, I plan to gradually add more foods and ways of<BR>
preparing foods--staying within the bounds of the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
I am also getting an ELISA test (scheduled for the 17th).  This should tell<BR>
me which foods I have an immune response to.  My plan is to use this<BR>
information to augment what I've learned on the SCD.  I'm expecting that I<BR>
will test positive for some of the foods that I have eliminated since being<BR>
on the SCD because my response to the diet was so dramatic and immediate (I<BR>
think it would take longer to respond to the change of bacteria in the gut).<BR>
I'm curious which foods I've already eliminated that I'll test positive for<BR>
because I'll never eat them again no matter what.  I also want to know if<BR>
there are SCD-legal foods that I test positive for as I will eliminate those<BR>
as well. While I don't plan to go off the SCD anytime soon, I think the<BR>
insights will be beneficial.  If I decide to add some non-SCD foods in the<BR>
long term future, I can ensure that they are not foods that I have an immune<BR>
response to.  (NB I will have to get retested in the future if I am<BR>
considering adding foods though.  The results of this test can change over<BR>
time as we age.  From what I've heard, getting tested every year or two is a<BR>
good idea.)<BR>

Dear Jeff,<BR>
The following is how I make my yogurt. It may seem cumbersome at first, but<BR>
after 2 &amp; 1/2 years it has become 2nd nature and I think I could make it in<BR>
my sleep.<BR>
Yogurt<BR>
<BR>
3 quarts of 1/2 &amp; 1/2<BR>
1 &amp; 1/2 cups plain store bought yogurt (1/2 cup to each quart of 1/2 &amp; 1/2)<BR>
<BR>
Bring 1/2 &amp; 1/2 to simmer (small bubbles around edge)<BR>
Take off burner and let cool to complete room temperature, cool better than<BR>
even slightly warm. You can refrigerate to help cool. If you don't<BR>
refrigerate, it takes at least 6 hours to get the right temp.<BR>
<BR>
Then in a seperate bowl, place plain yogurt and slowly add 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (I use<BR>
wisk). When this solution is thin, add back slowly (wisking) in pot of 1/2<BR>
&amp; 1/2.<BR>
<BR>
Place pot (covered) into oven with a 60 watt light bulb on. Keep<BR>
thermometer in oven and maintain 100 to 110 degrees. If oven becomes warm,<BR>
use a pen to prop open the door just a bit. Once you've done it a few times<BR>
you'll get a feel for how your oven best maintains this temperature.<BR>
Good Luck,<BR>

Pecan Flour is alot cheaper, but more difficult to cook with, as it is<BR>
&quot;oilier&quot; than the blanched, crisp almonds, which, when ground, more<BR>
closely resembles regular flour.  I switched to almond flour, even<BR>
though it is extremely EXPENSIVE.  If you are on a strict budget, but<BR>
want something &quot;bready&quot;, the pecan meal will help you get through.  It<BR>
tastes good, too! I wish I could eat cheap wheat flour and rice, but,<BR>
since I can't I &quot;get even&quot; by spending all this money on almond meal.<BR>
I'm not happy about it, but I'm healthy, and that's what counts!<BR>

Hi Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
Below you say there should be 1/2 cup yogurt for each QUART 1/2 and 1/2.<BR>
Elaine's French Cream recipe calls for 1/2 cup yogurt for each 2 cups of<BR>
cream or 1/2 and 1/2.  That's twice as much as yours calls for.  Do you<BR>
think the difference in amount of yogurt matters?<BR>

<BR>
Can anyone answer this seemingly logical question:<BR>
<BR>
When making yoghurt, is it possible to use too much starter yoghurt?  I <BR>
mean, since you will be cooking the formula for at least 24 hours, won't <BR>
any residual lactose from the starter yoghurt get consumed/neutralized?<BR>
<BR>
For this reason, if true, when making french cream or yoghurt with half <BR>
and half, I am inclined to go with too much rather than too little <BR>
starter yoghurt.<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone concur with this theory?<BR>
<BR>
PS If this is an &quot;old&quot; issue, I apologise, as I've deleted most yoghurt <BR>
messages without ever reading them.....(there's so many!)<BR>

I've been on the diet a little over a month now.  My period showed up, per<BR>
usual, but was a lot less painful than it had been.  I saw it as an<BR>
unexpected perk of the diet.  Ever since I got crohns, my period would make<BR>
the crohns flare (and fibromyalgia) and so I'd be really ill, in pain, and at<BR>
home for a few days each time.  This time was a breeze!<BR>
<BR>
So, from my experience, the crohns affected my periods, SCD affected my<BR>
crohns and therefore indirectly affected my periods.  Could it cause them to<BR>
stop?  I don't know.<BR>
