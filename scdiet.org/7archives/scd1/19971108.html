While it may be obvious to those who have experienced the problems, it<BR>
doesn't hurt to remind you that one should never go into a hospital without<BR>
a loved one, or other to watch out for you. <BR>
<BR>
It is unfortunate that there are not classes given for those who need to<BR>
watch over a patient. There is so much that goes wrong (the AMA admits that<BR>
there are 10% errors in hospitals and that 6% of patients ;eave with<BR>
illnesses that they did not have upon arriving.), that someone must always<BR>
be questioning the treament being given. <BR>
<BR>
My wife just had a heart procedure at Strong Memorial Hosp. in Rochester<BR>
NY. While the surgery may have been sucessfull (the verdict is not in) the<BR>
care both before and after sugery was detrimental, harmfull to her and only<BR>
my insistance and checking prevented more damage. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, while I can care for another well due to my learning<BR>
experiences of having been given wrong blood, wrong meds, soemone elses<BR>
meds, incrrest surgery, etc. most family members just don't realize what is<BR>
going on and can't ask the right questions. Often when we see a loved one<BR>
suffering and hear the nurses saying, &quot;there is always pain, etc. after<BR>
this procedure&quot;, we assume there is nothing else that can be done. <BR>
<BR>
Note that many hospitals now have discarded the heated blanket for chemical<BR>
&quot;heat packs&quot; a perfect example of something having gone wrong. Even thoug<BR>
the substitution seems on the surface to be logical, only those who have<BR>
experieced the need of immediate warmth, know the vast difference. <BR>
<BR>
Take Care!<BR>

<BR>
Hello all,<BR>
I have been trying the diet off &amp; on for 6 weeks now. I fell off due to<BR>
some birthday &amp; wedding celebrations that I was not strong enough to<BR>
resist.<BR>
<BR>
But I have just split a shipment of Hughson's flour with a local friend<BR>
also on the diet; and I just received some DCCC that was recommended on<BR>
the list.<BR>
<BR>
I have doubts though about the &quot;legality&quot; of this DCCC. It is impossible<BR>
to find here in Raleigh so I ordered it from the<BR>
Seward Family, Inc. in Vermont.<BR>
<BR>
Here's the list of ingredients:cultured skim milk,milk,cream,<BR>
salt,dextrose,guar gum,carageenan,potassium sorbate. I<BR>
know the carageenan is a no-no. Anything else?<BR>
<BR>
Does this make this brand of DCCC unacceptable? I know others on the scd<BR>
are using it. If so, can anyone tell me of another source to order from<BR>
on the East Coast?<BR>
<BR>
Also, I went to the GNC to find some vitamins but kept running in to bad<BR>
ingredients. Some I'm not sure off: talc (on<BR>
the coating), alfalfa, cellulose.<BR>
<BR>
Can anyone recommend a good multi-vitamin or would it be easier to just<BR>
buy each separately?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
Debbie<BR>

&gt;My son, not I has the Crohn's disease.  But I would like to respond to your<BR>
&gt;survey.  I have always been very physically affectionate with all (3) my<BR>
&gt;children.  Only my youngest son has Crohn's.  I, however, grew up in a<BR>
&gt;physically and mentally abusive environment and am healthy as a horse - thank<BR>
&gt;goodness!  I also don't believe that such behavior, although learned<BR>
&gt;(obviously) during my growing up period, is necessarily &quot;passed on&quot;.  I have<BR>
&gt;tried very hard as a parent not to repeat any of the behaviors that my<BR>
&gt;parents exhibited.  Of course, everyone is different and each of us deals<BR>
&gt;with situations in very different ways.  I, therefore, do not discount your<BR>
&gt;theories <BR>
<BR>
They're not MY theories.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm trying to see if there IS any theory that one COULD start<BR>
investigating; or even pondering about  based on the findings I described.<BR>
Findings NOT BY ME: research at McGill University's Douglas Hospital<BR>
Research Centre (a neuro-science centre) in Montreal, by Dr. Michael Meany.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;but don't feel that myself or my family fit into those theories.<BR>
&gt; Interesting though and I don't think you are alone in seeing some type of<BR>
&gt;correlation.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I agree: I've often heard this pronouncement (usually by<BR>
non-sufferers!) that &quot;it's all in your head&quot; or &quot;just relax, you have to<BR>
deal with your stress better&quot; or &quot;you just have a (fill the blank wity your<BR>
choice of words) type of personality&quot;.  So I look at all &quot;psycho-babble&quot;<BR>
pronouncements with a jaded eye, i.e. probably not worth the paper they're<BR>
printed on, more babble than gold.<BR>
<BR>
Still, one never knoews ... the field of humans' understanding of their<BR>
bodies &amp; their psyches is in an infant's stage, I'd say, so why not do some<BR>
&quot;rough homework&quot;, maybe we'll learn something?<BR>

&gt; <BR>
<BR>
GNC is the problem.  The quality of GNC products are on par with the huge<BR>
national vitamin marketers.  I once took a tour of a portapotty facility.<BR>
The owner one day decided to start collecting vitamins.  Talk about a huge<BR>
pile, and some of the pills you could clearly read the imprinting! <BR>
Centrum, One-a-day, they are all a marketing rip off and they are very low<BR>
potency -- most only provide 100% of the RDA, which is outdated, and is not<BR>
even enough to come close to a leaky gut sufferer's needs.  <BR>
<BR>
If I had to recommend mainstream, easily available supplements, I would go<BR>
with Schiff, Twinlab, or Nature's Way (a twinlab company also, I believe). <BR>
Almost all major drug stores carry at least some of these brands, and most<BR>
of their products are OK on the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
The options are limitless on mail order -- Freeda does seem to be a<BR>
reputable company, and their multi-vitamin formulas seem OK --<BR>
http://www.imall.com/stores/freeda/.  <BR>
<BR>
Personally, I prefer a capsule -- they can be made without fillers and<BR>
binders and you know that they are getting dissolved -- of course there's<BR>
no guarantee that they are actually being absorbed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps,<BR>

<BR>
Hello.<BR>
<BR>
This message, apparently, is for the women who were pregnant while having<BR>
Crohn's disease.<BR>
<BR>
My question is this:  Did you find that during the time of your<BR>
pregnancy(ies) your symptoms were better, worse, or the same?<BR>
<BR>
I found so far that those women who were pregnant had no CD symptoms what so<BR>
ever and never felt better -- until after giving birth.<BR>
<BR>
One of my doctors told me that it can go both ways : he had patients who did<BR>
well and also did worse during their pregnancy.<BR>
<BR>
The reason why this came up is because I needed new prescriptions for birth<BR>
control pills.  He advised me not to take them for at least 6 months to see<BR>
what happens.  It's been 2 months or so since I last took them, and I don't<BR>
know if my symptoms have been bad from the disease itself, from the pills or<BR>
lack of the pills.  And now that I am feeling better I don't know for sure if<BR>
it's from not taking the pills or from the diet and supplemets ((well,<BR>
definately the diet, but you know what I mean).<BR>
<BR>
Since the Pill mimicks pregnancy (tricks the body in thinking it's pregnant),<BR>
is it the same as being pregnant?<BR>
And, is anyone taking the Pill and feels a difference? Or were pregnant and<BR>
then went on the Pill?<BR>
<BR>
This is a dilema that has kept me wondering for weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Any thoughts?<BR>

I just read today an incredible article by Dr. David Williams (Vol 7,<BR>
No,4 Oct '97) saying how incredibly powerful fresh raw garlic is to<BR>
treat candida.  He says to get the freshest organic garlic the stronger<BR>
and more pungent the better) you can find at a health food store and<BR>
then eat four or five large raw cloves per day for a couple of weeks.<BR>
He says after 3 or 4 days it is no unusual for people to have a couple<BR>
of very large BMs with spaghetti like yeast organisms visible in the<BR>
stool, says these are yeast colonies. After a couple of weeks one can<BR>
then taper off and stop using the garlic.  <BR>
<BR>
Obviously, getting your son (or me or many others) to eat raw cloves of<BR>
garlic could be a real pain but you may be on to something about putting<BR>
it in caps.  Lot cheaper than Kyolic Liquid Garlic and perhaps far more<BR>
effective!<BR>
<BR>
This was in his newsletter, &quot;Alternatives&quot; published monthly by Mountain<BR>
Homes Publishing at 1201 Seven Locks Road, Rockville, MD. 20854.  Or<BR>
call 800-527-3044.  <BR>
<BR>
He also highly recommends Citricidal, a brand of grapefruit sees extract<BR>
for candida etc.  Can be found in any good health food store in either<BR>
liquid, tablets or capsules.<BR>

<BR>
Personally, I would not stop using regular salt.  NaCl (salt) is a<BR>
necessary nutrient for a variety of reasons, one of which is that the<BR>
Chloride is used for producing the Hydrocloric Acid we use to digest<BR>
protiens in our stomach.  Sodium is also a very important electrolyte<BR>
used in many ways in our body.<BR>
<BR>
Potassium supplements are widely available and should not replace our<BR>
use of salt.  <BR>
<BR>
This salt replacement idea comes from the now well debunked idea that<BR>
salt causes hypertension.  The salt scare is still widely believed<BR>
though, just like the cholesterol and low fat scare.  Often, it seems to<BR>
me,  we are well served by listening to what the media and MD's say, and<BR>
then promptly doing the opposite.  At least until they come back around<BR>
years later and say that newer research shows they were wrong.  Happens<BR>
all the time.<BR>

&gt; Personally, I would not stop using regular salt.  NaCl (salt) is a<BR>
&gt; necessary nutrient for a variety of reasons, one of which is that the<BR>
&gt; Chloride is used for producing the Hydrocloric Acid we use to digest<BR>
&gt; protiens in our stomach.  Sodium is also a very important electrolyte<BR>
&gt; used in many ways in our body.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
Personally, I would stop using regular salt and switch to a real, natural<BR>
salt.  Salt you buy in the supermarkets is not thing less that a purified<BR>
waste product.  Some people will go as far as to say that iodized salt is a<BR>
poison.  Right now I'm using a product called Real Salt which is<BR>
&quot;harvested&quot; from some sea somewhere.  A variety of naturally occurring<BR>
minerals are in it, and the taste is so much better than regular iodized<BR>
salt.  I haven't touched iodized salt for years now, and probably never<BR>
will.<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;9711090212.AA68148@acs5.acs.ucalgary.ca&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi group,<BR>
<BR>
My wife came up with a good question and she was wondering<BR>
if anyone might be able to anwser it.<BR>
<BR>
Is it ok for her to include potatoes in the pot along with<BR>
carrots and beef (or chicken) ?  Of course I won't be eating<BR>
the potatoes, but she will.  <BR>
<BR>
Is it still ok for me to have the broth (juices) in the pot,<BR>
or is it possible that the starch from the potatoes remains<BR>
in the broth ?  <BR>
<BR>
Same goes for a chicken and rice casserole (no rice for me) ?<BR>
<BR>
If anyone talks to Elaine, can you bring this one up !<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Steve,<BR>
<BR>
thanks for your comments re the almond flour and the DCCC.<BR>
<BR>
I don't get my DCCC from Country Cheese Co. because I live in Marin, not SF<BR>
and Whole Foods, which is just 3 miles from my house, has the wonderful<BR>
Friendship Farmer's Dry Curd Cottage Cheese with less than 1/2 of 1%<BR>
lactose in it...that's what I buy.  I get 1/2 of a loaf of it; one loaf is<BR>
3 # in weight; and get it individually wrapped in .50# portions to use in<BR>
my cheesecake and yogurt for breakfast.  This cheese is just beautiful and<BR>
very clean tasting and feeling to my guts.  Highly recommended.  Also,<BR>
Elaine gives this particular brand in the book!  I found it in Andronico's<BR>
last week also, but it was more expensive.  It is $4.49# at Whole<BR>
Foods...that, too is expensive, huh?<BR>

I recently boiled the milk in a make-shift double boiler, using medium high<BR>
heat as someone (Lucy?) suggested, with the top on the pot, and checking<BR>
periodically for stirring.  The 1 gallon of yogurt that I am eating is the<BR>

I checked his website today, just for kicks (he had a spelling error in the<BR>
last copy I downloaded, I wanted to check if he'd caught it yet!), and<BR>
noticed he has changed it quite a bit since I last looked (about 5 months<BR>
ago).<BR>
<BR>
For those of you now familiar with Dr. H.: he's an MD who's been a bit of a<BR>
&quot;thorn in the side&quot; of the SCD / alternative IBD folks like us because of<BR>
his &quot;orthodox / anti-alternative&quot; stance.<BR>

However, you gotta give the guy credit for trying, I figure.  <BR>

Good point Bill.  <BR>
<BR>
Been using Sea Salt for many years as well.  It is a much better<BR>
product.  In fact I have read where they regularly add sugar to iodized<BR>
salt.  Not good for SCDers.  I should have mentioned this in my post but<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;3.0.1.32.19971108210059.006c7db4@smartt.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi, Folks!<BR>
<BR>
It's Saturday night my time (west coast of Canada), I'm listening to<BR>
&quot;oldies&quot; music (right now, Paul Anka's singing that he's &quot;Livin' Right Next<BR>
Door to an Angel&quot;!), and feeling great.<BR>
<BR>
I'm also feeling great about the response to this survey ... the question<BR>
really struck a chord with you!  It was a pleasure to read all your<BR>
responses (public OR private!  oops!  mistakes DO happen) and to respond to<BR>
most of you personally.  Seems like this topic really entices people to<BR>
come out of the woodwork, so that's good.  I know that if I'm in a social<BR>
setting I seldom tell people any more that I'm a massage therapist ... the<BR>
topic draws a gathering like flies to honey; I've concluded that in our<BR>
culuture (and maybe MOST of the world's &quot;civilized&quot; cultures) most people<BR>
are &quot;good touch&quot; deprived.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the results.<BR>
<BR>
I had to invent a middle category to meet the responses (live &amp; learn!),<BR>
one I called &quot;low-touch with emotional/physical abuse&quot; in order to<BR>
more-correctly allocate other &quot;low-touch&quot; responses which did not have an<BR>
&quot;abuse&quot; factor with it.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I had to make some &quot;half-and-half&quot; allocations to accurately reflect<BR>
what people told me about their &quot;touch histories&quot;, when they could not be<BR>
honestly put into one simple category.<BR>
<BR>
So, of 14 responses  ...<BR>
<BR>
- 6 1/2 reported growing up in a pleasant <BR>
	&quot;high-good-touch&quot; family environment<BR>
<BR>
- 1 (actually 2 x 1/2) reported growing up with &quot;low-touch phys/emot abuse&quot;<BR>
<BR>
- 7 1/2 reported having a &quot;low-touch&quot; neutral / cool emotions <BR>
	environment NO physical abuse<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(There were 2 people who submitted duplicate responses from diff. e-mail<BR>
addresses, which I &quot;sorted out&quot; and caught ... sorry!)<BR>
<BR>
Based on that result, what do YOU think?  IS our IBD &quot;all in our heads&quot;<BR>
brought on by a bad psychological surrounding in our childhood?  Or does it<BR>
have an actual physical (bacterial / cellular?) cause?<BR>
<BR>
YOU be the judge!<BR>
<BR>
Send your comments to the list, I'm sure people have something to say (as<BR>
long as we eventually get back on the &quot;SCD track&quot; before someone gets upset!)?<BR>
<BR>
With many thanks, I'm really please that you all participated.  Ain't life<BR>
grand?<BR>
<BR>
		Until next time,<BR>

<BR>
All,<BR>
<BR>
With the holiday season upon us, I 've been thinking about the foods we<BR>
ordinarily eat at this time of year. Having been on the diet for about 5<BR>
months, this will be the first holiday season that our diet has been at all<BR>
restricted.<BR>
<BR>
The thing that actually prompted this message will probably not be much<BR>
concern to many on the list. However, those who hail from south of the<BR>
Mason/Dixon line (as do I) may have already been wondering about this item.<BR>
The food I am referring to is blackeyed peas. They are good at any time of<BR>
year, but are especially important at new year's. Supposedly, you need to<BR>
eat them to bring good luck in the comming 12 months. Now I know it's just<BR>
a superstition, but it's one I have always enjoyed... especially since I<BR>
live outside of the south. Whenever we have people over at new year's, I<BR>
make sure they get their dose.<BR>
<BR>
The next thing is cranberry sauce. does anyone have a killer recipe for SCD<BR>
cranberry sauce? My guess is: yes. Maybe you would like to share it.<BR>
<BR>
Next item: Stuffing. I'm figuring that almond bread would probably do<BR>
nicely. Has any one tried it?<BR>
<BR>
Yam's seems like an easy one. Mashed butternut squash should fill the gap<BR>
quite well.<BR>
<BR>
And now, after all those questions here's one suggestion. In Texas it was<BR>
always tradition at my house to have parched pecans. If you try this, it<BR>
may become tradition at yours. Melt a half a stick of butter, put pecans<BR>
into pan and ,coat them with butter add salt to taste, Spread pecans on a<BR>
cookie sheet, and put them into the oven on high. cook them until they are<BR>
dark and toasty.<BR>

Well - actually you can and you cann't...<BR>
It depends on your mail-service.<BR>
<BR>
If you use Microsoft Mail - you CAN actually receive a sort of virus.<BR>
Microsoft Mail uses Word as the Mail editor, and it's possible to write<BR>
macro's that are executed the moment the document is opened.<BR>
But this requires both the sender and receiver to use intergrated<BR>
Microsoft Mail service.<BR>
<BR>
It is also possible that an attached word document can have a &quot;macro-&quot;<BR>
virus, which is activated when the document is opened with a MSWord<BR>
editor.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pure&quot; e-mail's dont carry viruses.<BR>
<BR>
Durring installation of the different mail services you have different<BR>
options you can select /deselect to prevent macro's from being executed<BR>
automaticly.<BR>

	Hi, My name is Karen and I have known that I have Crohn's Disease<BR>
for the last three years.   I found out I had Chron's after I had<BR>
exploritory surgery.  My intestines had collapsed.  They removed a foot<BR>
of colon and a foot of intestine.  I hoped that I wouldn't have any more<BR>
problems, but that was not so.  I went on and off medication until Oct<BR>
'96.  From Oct '96 till Oct '97 I was on a small dose of predisone.   I<BR>
am off predisone but still taking imuran.  My dad who is retired found<BR>
out about the SCD in April '97 and I have been on the diet since April<BR>
27.  I feel like a new person even though I am not sympton free.  I have<BR>
no problem staying on this diet, because I know how I felt before.  My<BR>
dad has given me all the corespondence every day since April  because I<BR>
did not have a computer at home.  I have now purchased a computer and<BR>
would like to be a subscriber.  I not only feel much better, but as a<BR>
side effect I have lost 70 lbs.  <BR>

Hi, SCD'ers:<BR>
<BR>
It seems I &amp; others were duped by the fake &quot;virus warning&quot; ... because of<BR>
the source the message came from to me, I fully believed it to be true.  He<BR>
has since written me that HE got taken for a fool (apparently he's even<BR>
more computer il-literate than myself, and more than I had presumed!  silly<BR>
me).<BR>
<BR>
Since sending you that erroneous message, I've received AMPLE feedback<BR>
(thank you, you'all can stop now!  I get the point!).   ;-)<BR>
<BR>
And I've also received a very clear - detailed - useful e-mail on this<BR>
topic from a non-SCD'er; I decided to share it with you in case you also<BR>
find it useful ... <BR>

Hi Dietmar,<BR>
<BR>
You've been hoaxed.<BR>
<BR>
A good source for information on viruses is Rob Rosenberger's website:<BR>
http://kumite.com/myths/myths/<BR>
<BR>
Many myths have surfaced about the threat of computer &quot;viruses.&quot; There are<BR>
myths about how widespread they are, how dangerous they are, and even myths<BR>
about what a computer virus really is.<BR>
<BR>
The first thing you need to know is that a computer virus falls in the<BR>
realm of malicious programming techniques known as &quot;Trojan horses.&quot; All<BR>
viruses are Trojan horses, but relatively few Trojan horses can be called a<BR>
virus.<BR>
<BR>
Further information can be found at IBM's Antivirus online:<BR>

Karen,<BR>
What a wonderful story!  Sounds like you and your dad are very close.  Did<BR>
you know anyone else on the diet or have you been going it totally alone?  Do<BR>
you eat all the scd foods or do you have problems with some part of the diet?<BR>
 You've been on it longer than me (about 1 month).  Also, are you from the<BR>
Boston area?  Where do you buy the DCCC?  Sorry so many questions, but<BR>
welcome to the group and I'm interested in your experiences with the diet.<BR>
 Take care, Jane<BR>

Hi.  I sent an e-mail the other day regarding the effects of pregnancy on<BR>
Crohn's.  Somehow I did not receive the digested SCD list yesterday like I do<BR>
every evening.  I received today's, but did not see my letter, nor any<BR>
replies.<BR>
<BR>
I don't know if it went through, or if it did but did not receive the list<BR>
that included it.<BR>
<BR>
If anyone happened to read it and sent any imput....I never received it.  If<BR>
you did, can you please mail me a copy to my own e-mail (PI5DA@AOL.COM) in<BR>
case I don't get the digested list again?<BR>
<BR>
Again, my question was if anyone who was pregnant while  having Crohn's seen<BR>
any imrovement in their condition, or increased problems, or no change at<BR>
all?<BR>
My doctor told me that his patients fared either way, and recommended I stay<BR>
off the Pill to see if there is any change in my symtoms.  If the Pill tricks<BR>
the body into thinking it's pregnant, is it the same as being pregnant?  And<BR>
if those that fared well during pregnancy could have similar results on the<BR>
Pill?<BR>
<BR>
Just curious....<BR>

Simone - my Little Sis Karen is 30, was diagnosed with Crohn's at 18 and<BR>
has 2 children, ages 9 and 6 months. Each time she was pregnant her<BR>
Crohn's stayed the same during pregnancy, but about 2 to 3 weeks after<BR>
birth, she experienced her worst flare-ups of all. She just started the<BR>
SCD, so I don't know if this would have made any difference in the<BR>
flare-ups. She has stayed off the Pill since her first child and uses<BR>
diaphragms. After her first birth she had surgery to repair major colon<BR>
damage and fistulas that developed during the last months of pregnancy.<BR>
Thankfully, that did not happen with the last child.  Sorry I'm not very<BR>
optimistic, but I think the SCD diet would make a world of difference.<BR>

Hi Dietmar and anyone else wondering about this,<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; WARNING!!! If you receive an e-mail titled &quot;JOIN THE CREW&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Responses on this from Laurie, Kris, and Denali321 (Jim?)<BR>
were all correct.<BR>
 <BR>
This has already been determined to be a hoax (I first saw<BR>
this message 2-3 months ago).  I work in the computing services<BR>
area for the University of Calgary.  In the office next to me<BR>
sits the manager of network services, and he is the one who<BR>
personally looks into SPAM mail, hackers and viruses.  He<BR>
made it quite clear that this was a joke started by someone.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this settles the matter.<BR>

If you are in the Boston area, you can get Friendship Brand Farmer's cheese<BR>
 (DCCC) at Stop and Shop in the dairy dept, near the sour cream, etc. In<BR>
small plastic-wrapped packages.  Also at Roche Bros, they have a more<BR>
expensive version of Farmer's cheese in their gourmet cheese case.  This is<BR>
usually various sizes of cut-up pieces in clear plastic containers.  Don't<BR>
remember the cost per lb, but it is more than Stop&amp;Shop.<BR>

Thanks Julie,<BR>
I guess I'm just confused from other posts I've read.  I've looked at the<BR>
Friendship farmer's cheese and thought it looked a lot more moist (and I<BR>
thought that was bad) than the dry curd that I get from Seward's in Vermont<BR>
(which was recommended in the book and really looks like dry curd).  But<BR>
Sewards' has many other questionable ingredients.  I guess I'll try the<BR>
Friendship since I can buy it locally.  I know some of you are probably sick<BR>
of hearing about the dry curd dilemma, but I'm still not 100% on this thing<BR>
because there seem to be contradictions. Thanks again, Jane<BR>

i get these brands at H.E.B (a texas food store chain) i have found<BR>
either the same brands or similar at WalMart. I suprised that it's<BR>
not at Whole Foods, since established medicine fears salt so much<BR>
that they advise their hypertensive patients to avoid excess salt or<BR>
salt entirely.<BR>

Where do you buy the Morton lite salt, or nu salt? Is it at Safeway? I found<BR>
no salt substitutes at the health food store (Whole Foods).<BR>

&gt;Do you think they ferment their yogurt 24 hours?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I've never asked ... probably commercial kind.<BR>
I was talking with Mik last week, (he's an Africa-phile &amp; goes there lots,<BR>
presumably for his job with Danish radio?) and he said that Africans eat<BR>
many fermented foods.  (although he added the wry observation how could any<BR>
food NOT end up being fermented there!)  <BR>
<BR>
Something I didnt' know; interesting.  Because they hardly have IBD (they<BR>
harve starvation from overpopulation, though, but that's another story):<BR>
usually one thinks &quot;that's because they eat basic, non-industrical foods&quot;,<BR>
but maybe that's NOT the reason, and instead it's their high intake of<BR>
FERMENTED foods?<BR>
<BR>
I wonder how one could check that out ... hey, how come we don't have any<BR>
black folks or Africans on this list  (yeah, I know they can't afford Net<BR>
service ... but I'm sure we must have some African 's whiz-kind son luring<BR>
? in our midst somewhere?)  Whereever you are, come on out, we're<BR>
listening, if you're there, tell us about fermented food on the subcontinent?<BR>

I haven't talked to Elaine about your question, but I think I know what<BR>
her answer would be. I would recommend that your wife cook the rice or<BR>
potatoes separately, and add them later to her serving only. <BR>

&gt;Hi group,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;My wife came up with a good question and she was wondering<BR>
&gt;if anyone might be able to anwser it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Is it ok for her to include potatoes in the pot along with<BR>
&gt;carrots and beef (or chicken) ?  Of course I won't be eating<BR>
&gt;the potatoes, but she will.  <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Is it still ok for me to have the broth (juices) in the pot,<BR>
&gt;or is it possible that the starch from the potatoes remains<BR>
&gt;in the broth ?  <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Same goes for a chicken and rice casserole (no rice for me) ?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;If anyone talks to Elaine, can you bring this one up !<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi, Folks!<BR>
<BR>
It's Saturday night my time (west coast of Canada), I'm listening to<BR>
&quot;oldies&quot; music (right now, Paul Anka's singing that he's &quot;Livin' Right Next<BR>
Door to an Angel&quot;!), and feeling great.<BR>
<BR>
I'm also feeling great about the response to this survey ... the question<BR>
really struck a chord with you!  It was a pleasure to read all your<BR>
responses (public OR private!  oops!  mistakes DO happen) and to respond to<BR>
most of you personally.  Seems like this topic really entices people to<BR>
come out of the woodwork, so that's good.  I know that if I'm in a social<BR>
setting I seldom tell people any more that I'm a massage therapist ... the<BR>
topic draws a gathering like flies to honey; I've concluded that in our<BR>
culuture (and maybe MOST of the world's &quot;civilized&quot; cultures) most people<BR>
are &quot;good touch&quot; deprived.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the results.<BR>
<BR>
I had to invent a middle category to meet the responses (live &amp; learn!),<BR>
one I called &quot;low-touch with emotional/physical abuse&quot; in order to<BR>
more-correctly allocate other &quot;low-touch&quot; responses which did not have an<BR>
&quot;abuse&quot; factor with it.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I had to make some &quot;half-and-half&quot; allocations to accurately reflect<BR>
what people told me about their &quot;touch histories&quot;, when they could not be<BR>
honestly put into one simple category.<BR>
<BR>
So, of 14 responses  ...<BR>
<BR>
- 6 1/2 reported growing up in a pleasant <BR>
	&quot;high-good-touch&quot; family environment<BR>
<BR>
- 1 (actually 2 x 1/2) reported growing up with &quot;low-touch phys/emot abuse&quot;<BR>
<BR>
- 7 1/2 reported having a &quot;low-touch&quot; neutral / cool emotions <BR>
	environment NO physical abuse<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(There were 2 people who submitted duplicate responses from diff. e-mail<BR>
addresses, which I &quot;sorted out&quot; and caught ... sorry!)<BR>
<BR>
Based on that result, what do YOU think?  IS our IBD &quot;all in our heads&quot;<BR>
brought on by a bad psychological surrounding in our childhood?  Or does it<BR>
have an actual physical (bacterial / cellular?) cause?<BR>
<BR>
YOU be the judge!<BR>
<BR>
Send your comments to the list, I'm sure people have something to say (as<BR>
long as we eventually get back on the &quot;SCD track&quot; before someone gets upset!)?<BR>
<BR>
With many thanks, I'm really please that you all participated.  Ain't life<BR>
grand?<BR>

I was considering using aloe vera myself, but the brand that I was looking<BR>
at listed polysaccharides as one of the ingredients, which means it is<BR>
definitely not allowed on the SCD.  I'm not sure if all aloe would be the same.<BR>

There are carbohydrates left in the fermented yogurt and I think you are<BR>

what lactose breaks down into.  If anyone knows differently please correct me.<BR>

The aloe question has come up before and we asked Elaine about it.  She says it contains <BR>
anthraquinone.  That is the part of epson salts that makes you go to the bathroom.  <BR>
<BR>
From what I remember of the previous discussion, there are forms of aloe where attempts <BR>
have been made to remove this substance, but even in this case it is not recommended.<BR>

&gt; i too have been drinking aloe vera juiceoff and on for  last 10 years. I<BR>
&gt; make sure it contains no carageenan, as some of the products/brands do.<BR>
&gt; Lily of the desert brand is the one i use most often. i.ve used gel and<BR>
&gt; juice types.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Does it help? I'm not sure, but i like to think so.<BR>

Pat,<BR>
I think I remember you talking about having a lot of nausea.  I would like to<BR>
ask you a question, or anyone else who might know, for a friend of mine.<BR>
 About 3 months ago he thought he had the flu and felt nauseous.  Well he<BR>
never got over the nausea and has had endless tests done that all came out<BR>
negative.  He says he hears and feels his stomach making lots of noise but he<BR>
doesn't have any diarrhea, just degrees of nausea.  Any ideas or do you want<BR>
to speculate?  I thought someone sent you a remedy that sounded good but I<BR>
forgot what it was.  I know about ginger, but I think he needs something<BR>
more.  Thank-you, Jane  <BR>

Message-ID: &lt;199711111242.HAA00171@troi.hunterlab.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Greetings!<BR>
<BR>
Has anyone had experience with oil of oregano, or knows where I can get <BR>
independent information about it?  In trying to get rid of Candida, or some <BR>
other yeast or bad overgrowth (?), I picked up a bottle this weekend.  A <BR>
book written by Dr. Ingram, &quot;The Cure is in the Cupboard,&quot; praises this <BR>
essential oil as being able to cure Candida and just about every other <BR>
virus, bacteria, fungus, or bad guy plaguing mankind.  You're supposed to <BR>
also take capsules of crushed wild oregano at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
I tried it a couple of times, 3 drops under the tongue, and just about saw <BR>
visions through the tears.  It's like swallowing turpentine (I imagine). <BR>
 Although I smelled like pizza all day, which isn't too bad except that I'm <BR>
an SCDer and it was driving me crazy,  what concerns me is that killing <BR>
bacteria in a petri dish is one thing, but running the stuff through your <BR>
liver is something else entirely.  I have only one body and don't especially <BR>
relish trading an intestinal problem for liver cancer down the road.<BR>
<BR>
Any info would be appreciated.  Grapefruit seed extract is next.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
Just to report, that what SCD have not been able to do for me in more <BR>
than 1/2 year, the Pro Symbioflor bacteria mixture seems to do...<BR>
<BR>
I use 20 drops of Pro Symbioflor twice a day and SymbioLact Comp twice a <BR>
day.<BR>
<BR>
Compare this to ordinary bacteria-pills/capsules like Paraghurt, and the <BR>
amount of bacteria is more than 1000 times more. Also more different <BR>
sorts of bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
I have only been able to find this in Germany, but it seems that every <BR>
chemist carry it there so it can't be that bad...<BR>
<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; Hi.  I sent an e-mail the other day regarding the effects of pregnancy on<BR>
&gt; Crohn's.  Somehow I did not receive the digested SCD list yesterday like I do<BR>
&gt; every evening.  I received today's, but did not see my letter, nor any<BR>
&gt; replies.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I don't know if it went through, or if it did but did not receive the list<BR>
&gt; that included it.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; If anyone happened to read it and sent any imput....I never received it.  If<BR>
&gt; you did, can you please mail me a copy to my own e-mail (PI5DA@AOL.COM) in<BR>
&gt; case I don't get the digested list again?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Again, my question was if anyone who was pregnant while  having Crohn's seen<BR>
&gt; any imrovement in their condition, or increased problems, or no change at<BR>
&gt; all?<BR>
&gt; My doctor told me that his patients fared either way, and recommended I stay<BR>
&gt; off the Pill to see if there is any change in my symtoms.  If the Pill tricks<BR>
&gt; the body into thinking it's pregnant, is it the same as being pregnant?  And<BR>
&gt; if those that fared well during pregnancy could have similar results on the<BR>
&gt; Pill?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Just curious....<BR>

Hi Simone,<BR>
<BR>
This is Isabella, I joined SCD recently and thought the following<BR>
might be of interest from a holistic view point.<BR>
<BR>
The contraceptive pill can deplete the body of certain nutrients,<BR>
e.g. Vitamin B6, Folic Acid, Zinc, and the 'Friendly Bacteria' - hence<BR>
some people on the pill are more likely to get thrush etc.<BR>
<BR>
If the contraceptive pill has a detrimental effect on the friendly<BR>
bacteria in ones gut, then it will in turn affect the guts ability<BR>
to synthesize certain nutrients, and will affect the pH in the gut <BR>
which is important for absorption of nutrients.<BR>
<BR>
I read in the September 1995 'Nutrition Action Healthletter' that<BR>
there is evidence that people are at lower risk of developing colon<BR>
cancer if they have adequate levels of folic acid (which occurs in<BR>
food folate), e.g. in lots of fruit and vegetables, especially leafy<BR>
greens.<BR>
<BR>
Adequate levels of zinc are important for healing.<BR>
<BR>

My nausea has gotten better all the time using SCD.  I do occasionally<BR>
use Enzymatics product called Gastric Soothe which is Calcium Carbonate,<BR>
Diglycerized Licorace and Glycine.  No sugars or additives.  Works very<BR>
well.  <BR>
<BR>
I also discovered that a supplement I was taling called<BR>
N-ACetyl-Cysteine was really upsetting my stomach when I took it on an<BR>
empty stomach.  WIth food, don't have the same problem.<BR>
<BR>
I also found that digestion works a whole lot better when I don't drink<BR>
with my meals.  This is recommended also by many writers of health<BR>
books.  Also, use HCL and digestive enzymes with meals.  Seem to help a<BR>
lot.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps your freind.<BR>

Hello Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
	Welcome to the Specific Carbohydrate Diet forum. The agenda here is<BR>
the discussion of a book called &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; written by<BR>
Elaine Gottschall. The book contains the diet developed by Dr. Sidney<BR>
Valentine Haas which has an astoundingly high success rate in the treatment<BR>
of inflammatory bowel disease. The diet cured Elaine Gottschall's younger<BR>
daughter over forty years ago of ulcerative colitis after various medical<BR>
approaches were no longer effective and surgery appeared imminent. Ms.<BR>
Gottschall entered university at that time in an effort to try and<BR>
understand how something as simple as a dietary change could reverse a<BR>
so-called incurable disease. She spent twelve years in the research<BR>
community at three leading North American universities. This scientific<BR>
training combined with seven years of consulting convinced her of the<BR>
effectiveness of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet in reversing many<BR>
gastrointestinal disorders, especially inflammatory bowel disease. The<BR>
book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle, is her contribution as a scientific<BR>
hypothesis upon which future researchers can do further work. For many of<BR>
us the book is also the source of restored health. If anyone is finding<BR>
difficulty in locating a copy of  the book, it will be available through<BR>
this list.<BR>
<BR>
	Many of us who have been on the diet for any length of time have<BR>
experienced the miraculous healing powers of this diet and are here to<BR>
share our experience and tips for living with it. In the process,  perhaps<BR>
we can learn a few things ourselves. Some of us have additionally<BR>
discovered adjunct therapies (exercise, allowable supplements, ect.) and<BR>
these contributions  may be helpful. It is important however to focus on<BR>
the diet itself. There are many diets and many forms of alternative<BR>
medicines available that promise to aid those suffering with IBD. For that<BR>
purpose, there are many lists and web sites out there to provide<BR>
information on these. This list  however, has been formed to promote and<BR>
discuss the &quot;Specific Carbohydrate diet&quot; exclusively. Forums usually have a<BR>
chairperson in place to help direct issues that pertain to the subject at<BR>
hand. As there will be no governing bodies here, it is asked that we<BR>
individually use self-restraint to ensure that the subject of the SCD<BR>
remains the primary focus.  Most of us here can address questions from<BR>
newcomers and welcome the opportunity to do so. Elaine is not on the<BR>
internet. She does plan on being available to answer the tricky stuff and<BR>
promises to occasionally forward comments to the group.<BR>
<BR>
	 It is our hopes that we can continue to grow and to assist the portion of our<BR>
society plagued by IBD,  towards restored health. Life without pain,<BR>
bleeding and the constant search for a bathroom is indeed a blessing.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Rachel Turet<BR>

<BR>
I've just started reading. I sent an earlier email, but I'm not sure it<BR>
went through; something else didn't go through that day, so.... I've been<BR>
on the diet for a bit less than a month and it seems to be helping me<BR>
somewhat. Patience, I guess is the key....<BR>
<BR>
Are raisins a no-no since grapes aren't well tolerated by everyone?<BR>
What about &quot;approved&quot; cheeses for those with candida problems (since<BR>
cheeses are usually no-no'ed for us)?<BR>
Does anyone else suspect that Candida and more medically accepted<BR>
diagnoses are related to each other?<BR>
<BR>
A friend who has UC and recommended the diet to me said that half and<BR>
half was great to use to prepare the yogurt. Is this accurate (and safe)?<BR>
<BR>
Regarding Kombucha tea, I've read some warnings about it, just FYI:<BR>
4/24/95 Newsweek - one death and one illness in Iowa from (suspected)<BR>
batch of contaminated Kombucha (homemade). According to some info I<BR>
received from Candida &amp; Intestinal Dybiosis Foundation, if you are having<BR>
health problems, it's best to consume only commercially controlled<BR>
Kombucha products. Hope this is helpful and not too scary.<BR>
