&quot;Your Body's Many Cries for Water&quot;<BR>
- new book by Dr. F. Batmanghelidji<BR><BR>

&quot;Water is the gey to good health, says Dr. Fereydoon Batmanghelidji - an
Irinian who now lives in America. But how many of us drink enough of it?
Yet the human body is made up of 75 percent water. The less we drink, the more
troubles we store up. Water is a much neglected miracle painkiller.
Water shortage in different areas of the body manifests its signal for thirst
with physical bodily pains and disorders. Dr. Batmanghelidji's research has
revealed. He says asthma, stomach ulcers, headaches, colitis, stress, and
obesity are all based on dehydration and its knock-on effects.
We should all drink at least six to eight cups of water everyday, he says.
An intake of half a teaspoon of sea salt a day also does wonders.<BR>

His book is liberally littered with testimonials from people who have benefited
from his unique knowledge.<BR>
A fellow doctor, Dr. Jose A. Rivera (from Allentown, Pennsylvania), writes:
&quot;Due to the information that you have provided, I have been able to ameliorate<BR>
and cure my asthma with water and salt intake. I have been asthma free for
approximately one and a half years and have not had any reactions to the
allergen of the past.&quot;<BR>

Dr. Batmanghelidji is pioneering a scientific approach that will shake to its
foundations clinical medical practice as we now know it.<BR>
At the dawn of scientific inquiry into &quot;the workings of the body&quot;, the dispute
over the primacy of solvents and solids in organisms was resolved in favour of
solids. As a result, the water in the body was reduced to chemically
insignificant wrappers for the solids which were, and still are, assumed to
regulate all the activities of the body.<BR>
Under this assumption, all applied research efforts have been directed at
finding substances that can be held responsible for causing disease.
When this fails to identify a damaged substance as in the case of a bacterial
infection or site injury, treatments through drugs or vaccine remain
tantalisingly elusive or at best palliative and certainly not curative.
This is the reason why, acoording to Dr. Batmanghelidji: &quot;Hyptertension is not
generally cured; it is treated during the lifetime of a person.<BR>
Asthma is not cured; inhalers are the constant companion of the afflicted.
Allergy is not cured; the victim is always dependent on medication.&quot;
He strongly believed that it is the water content of cells that regulate all
bodily functions and NOT the chemicals that are dissolved in the water.&quot;

1997, p.39.)<BR><BR>

Whether Batmanghelidji is right or not, it sure can't hurt to remember to drink
plenty of water - every day!<BR>

Thanks for the copy.  I completely agree, water is the neglected food.<BR>
<BR>
We should all be drinking two quarts of water a day.  Not two quarts of<BR>
liquid.  If you drink three 8 ounce glasses of juice, it doesn't mean you can<BR>
drink three less glasses of water!<BR>
<BR>
Drinker Beware!  Please be careful of WHAT water you drink.  None of us would<BR>
buy beverages with added harsh chemicals, but most of us don't hesitate<BR>
drinking a glass of Florine and Chlorine treated city tap water.  This stuff<BR>
is HORRIBLE for our bodies.  Buy a good quality filter, or drink GOOD bottled<BR>
water.<BR>
<BR>
Just my suggestions.<BR>

Becky...Forgive me if I sound like I'm repeating myself, but I can't help but<BR>
mention again...check out the book &quot;<A HREF="../1998/batmang.html">
YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER</A>&quot;.  If you<BR>
can't afford it, have your library order it for you.  And please check out the<BR>
other site I mentioned...even it's it's just to educate yourself.  I believe<BR>
the address to subscribe is: list@rawtimes.com  or owner-list@rawtimes.com.<BR>
It's a great source of real good information on health issues.<BR>
<BR>
The Dr. specifically talks about constipation and colitis.  For now, Start<BR>
adding 2 glasses of water a day to your diet until you're drinking at least 8,<BR>
8 oz glasses &quot;at a minimum&quot; a day.  This would be distilled water only by the<BR>
way..and not in milky colored soft plastic bottles either, because of the<BR>
formaldhyde (spelling?)that leaks into the water from the plastic.  Does a<BR>
number on our hormones and other systems.  You can probably find distilled<BR>
water in your area to be delivered to your home in hard plastic 5 gallon jugs<BR>
that are blue in color. <BR>
 <BR>
You cannot substitute juices or other liquids for your pure water intake.  If<BR>
you're still constipated add two more glasses a day. But, get the book so<BR>
you'll understand the importance of water intake. <BR>
<BR>
The dr. says chronic dehydration is the cause of constipation and colitis and<BR>
many other diseases.   Your dehyrdration is not going to turn around suddenly<BR>
by now drowning yourself in water.  It will take a few months to turn it<BR>
around.  You must walk everyday as well if you don't now. At least 30-60<BR>
minutes a day.   <BR>
<BR>
Best wishes! colleen<BR>

I have been on this list for a couple of months now and I find it
interesting that of all the good advice I read from folks, I have yet to see
very much said about the importance of drinking lots of water (bottled of
course). I know that for me, I simply must discipline myself to now only
adhere strictly to the diet, but I must also drink an abundance of water. <BR>

Dan,<BR>
Months ago you posted a web site about the importance of maintaining a well
hydrated body. I read that web page and took your advice seriously by adhering
to a conscious amount of water drinking. There is difference in my health with
adequate hydration.<BR>
I try to drink about five pounds of water a day (10-12 glasses).<BR>
Re post the site address for the benefit of newcomers.<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
