<B>Hello everybody,</B>
<P>I am one of the people who have had such success on the SCD that I am
now so busy enjoying a regular life, I have wandered away from
participating in the list as much as I used to.  One of the pitfalls of
getting healthier! I have been on the diet since March 97, going on
eleven months now.  I am someone whom the diet has helped very much.  I
know there has been a lot of discussion on the list about whether the
diet is enough.


<P>My opinion is that for those whom it works for, it works very well. 
If
it doesn't, then it may not be worthwhile for you to be on the diet.
Elaine recommends a month on the diet to see if it helps.  If it doesn't
perhaps you need something else, or a personal variation (which could no
longer truly be called the SCD, by the way).


<P>I myself had to eliminate many so-called &quot;okay&quot; foods for a
long time.
I even gave up honey, all dairy and all fruit except apples for several
months.  Now I can eat everything.  I even had some &quot;cheats&quot;
over the
holidays, namely some chocolate and white sugar, and didn't have a
single symptom from my transgressions, which is really amazing to me.  I
never dreamed I would have such good bowel health again in my life.  By
the way, my condition has been IBD.


<P>I've been in remission since last August.  I have gone through many
many
patterns of up and down during this past year, with relapses and bouts
of flu-like symptoms.  But from my experience, I want to encourage
everyone to stay optomistic and keep trying.  Don't give up and don't
ever cheat until you have at least been symptom free for a long time (of
course, Elaine recommends staying on the diet for a year after you last
symptom) and know you could handle it emotionally if you backslide into
a relapse..


<P>Do what you need to do for yourself if you need to take supplements,
vitamins or the drugs that help you, we are all highly individual.
However, it is my belief that the SCD really does rehabillitate bowel
health over the long term, even without additional measures.  It may
take a long time.  But the basic premise is sound.  I know this from
having tried many angles of alternative health care and traditional
western medicine over many years of debilitation.  I think I will remain
on an SCD pattern of eating for the rest of my life, because it actually
is rather habit forming after being on it so long.  And also because my
Mom has had Crohns and I think my gut is my &quot;weak link.&quot;  I
will
undoubtedly always have to be careful.  I can still tell how stress
affects my gut, although I haven't had a relapse in many months.


<P>I also think it is important to really read the book -- and to
re-read
the book at some point, because there are things you will understand
after being on the diet for awhile that might have not made as much
sense in the beginning.  There is a lot of science to understand. I wish
everybody a great deal of luck to top it all off!


<P>Best wishes everybody,
Denise

<P>Fiona,


<P>First let me be clear that what I mean by being able to &quot;eat
everything&quot;
is everything that is on the SCD diet.  I have not experimented with
grains at all, or anything else for that matter, short of the cheats I
had over the holidays that did not affect me adversely.  But to answer
your question,  four months.  In August I was still not able to eat some
things.  I might also add that I took medicine to erradicate an amoeba
at that time (in August) and that made a big difference for me, helped
along the SCD for me in a big way.  I think it just shows how unique all
our situations are.


<P>Best wishes,
Denise

<P>Hello Michelle,

<P>I have some of the same questions that you do regarding the SCD diet.
 I came
out of eight years of  Crohn's remission  in september and went on the
SCD
diet and Pentasa in october.  My daily bouts of loose stools and D.
stopped
almost immediately.  I am staying strictly on the diet, but am not
limiting
the quantities of any permitted foods, ie. as much fruit, honey,
yoghurt,
nuts, meat, vegetables etc. as I can eat.  I seem to tolerate
everything.  The
pains from inflammation have subsided substantially, but are still
present
occasionally.  I was very anemic, but have been very aggressive with 
iron,
b-12, folic acid, and a host of vitamins.  My blood levels improved
quite a
bit in two months but still have a way to go.  I have a stricture that
is too
small to allow a scope through and finally, may be developing my first
fistula.  I really hope that isn't the case.


<P>My feelings on all this is that I will give nutrition (SCD) and
modern
medicine 100% each a chance to get me to the best overall health I can
have.
Stopping eight years of D. is surely an improvement and I contribute
that
exclusively to SCD.  According to Elaine Gottschall that should also
improve
blood levels.  I expect it is the Pentasa that has helped reduce the
pain of
inflammation this quickly.  But it may not be enough.  We'll see.  I've
always
been a firm believer in modern medicine.  But I chose to go on the SCD
diet
because it makes so much sense.  We are all learning as we go.  I think
the
restrictions of the diet is a small price to pay for the chance it may
bring
renewed health.


<P>Good luck!

Subject: <B>Re: Candida vs. Bacteria/Honey Consumption<BR></B>

<P>I wasn't going to write this until I'm sure that I'm on the right
track but here goes (I hope I don't have to eat my words - there's
not much else I can eat at the moment! :) ) Anyway, I've been sick
for about 3 1/2 years with extreme weight loss, sickness, nausea,
unable to eat anything sweet including all fruit, and not much
carbohydrate or large amounts of food.  For the last few months have
been afraid to eat hardly anything, as my bowel and stomach have
such a bad reaction. I've been cutting right down on carbohydrates
and mainly having vegie juices, and getting pretty weak.


<P>I went to a new gastroenterologist a couple of months ago, who
recently performed a colonoscopy (my 4th I think, first time with
him).  I haven't had the result back yet, but he also made an
appointment for me at the Allergy Clinic which is attached to one of
our main teaching hospitals.  It was free, so I figured I'd humour
him and go along for the ride, as I couldn't convince him my problem
was parasites and/or yeast (both of which have been diagnosed) which
has resulted in colitis.  I went there three days ago, and the
interview lasted just over 3 hours. I was tested for allergies (skin
prick test), which came up zilch.  Then I saw a doctor, who took my
medical history. Lastly I saw a very knowledgeable dietician (to my
ears anyway!). The longer I sat there listening, the more upright I
sat in my seat. Suddenly I felt renewed hope for orthodox medical
practice!  I haven't read Elaine's book, but judging by what some
people are eating/not eating on this list, I imagine it's something
similar to what she talks about (or maybe not). 


<P>The clinic told me about how all food contains chemicals and can be
divided up into three main food groups - ie. Salicylates, Amines and
Glutamines, and how some people react against these chemicals and
they call this &quot;intolerance&quot; (as opposed to
&quot;allergy&quot;).  Every food
has varying amounts of these chemicals, ranging from low, to
moderate, to very high.  These intolerances can be very severe, and
debilitating in some people, and occasionally require
hospitalisation.  Other people get through life just feeling unwell
and have varying degrees of diarrohea/constipation etc and feel not
quite right, and others sail through life and eat all they like
without any effect!  I felt quite happy with this explanation, and
glad they weren't going to tell me that I was making it all up!! and
it was only a touch of irritable bowel or some other rubbish.
Anyway, I came away loaded up with explanatory books, a food diary to
keep for 2 to six weeks, &amp; diets with yummy sweet foods in(!).  I
thought, well if I eat half this stuff I'm going to end up in
hospital!  I was a bit hesitant, but it didn't take me long to try
out the rice flour pancakes with golden syrup or the Golden Carob
Roll, not to mention the soup with more carbohydrates than I'd had in
a week!  I went to bed the first night thinking I wasn't going to be
able to get out of the bloody thing the next day!  I had nightmares
about plane crashes and being lost in fog....but woke up the next day
feeling fine, just a slight headache, nothing like I was expecting.
Couldn't believe it. Apart from constipation, no reaction from my
stomach or bowel, two parts of my body I would rather not be so
intimately acquainted with!


<P>Apparently, all sugar has chemicals in it, but the sugars with the
lowest chemical makeup, is golden syrup, maple syrup, and white
sugar. Honey is very high in natural chemicals, along with all jams,
fruit flavourings, chocolate, mints, peppermints, and lemon butter.
In the moderate range is molasses and raw sugar. Apparently because
white sugar is refined it's had most of the chemicals removed.  All
fruit varies in its chemical makeup and ranges from low, moderate,
high to very high. Lowest are pears (ripe and peeled - lots of
salicylate in the rind) and is the only fruit permitted in initial
stages of the diet. This approach ranges over a wide variety of
vegies as well.  Now I understood why I would eat some things which
were ok for me but combined with food which weren't ok and made me
feel ill, so I would put all those foods on the prohibited list.


<P>Meanwhile physically I feel fairly good, and emotionally I feel over
the moon.  Of course tomorrow's another story, but if I can get
through to the middle of next week without a flare I know this is my
problem, and my search will be over!  If not it'll be a double dose
of anti-depressants and a straight-jacket - I'll keep you all
posted.

tell us the titles and
authors?  I'd like to read them to see if it makes sense for me&gt;&gt;
</FONT>

<P>Hi Fiona,


<P>The books they gave me are written themselves at the Allergy Unit
and only one is available here in Sydney major bookstores - Friendly
Food (a recipe book). The other a booklet is called Salicylates,
Amines and Glutamate and one called The Simplified Elimination Diet.
If you give me a couple of days, I'll get together the basic outline
for you.


<P>I got a bit sick yesterday, as I'd started using soy milk and tofu
again. They say that soy is ok, but -some- people may be allergic to
it. I've stopped using it (since lunch time yesterday) and feel heaps
better again. It's only been 4 1/2 days but my colon has settled down
a lot, and I don't feel ill (very unusual considering what I've been
eating). I can still feel my colon but it doesn't feel inflamed
anymore, I guess also it may take a while for the tissue to heal
because it's no longer being &quot;attacked&quot; by the food chemicals.
I've
also started having more normal BM's (today). I had a pancake made
with allergy free pancake mix and golden syrup late yesterday had no
effects. I still can't believe I could have been so sick from food
intolerances! I'm starting to put a little weight on as well. I've
made some rice and sago vanilla ice-cream (I just cooked and
high-speed-blended the white rice and sago together with vanilla and
a teaspoon of golden syrup) and froze it and I'm going to have it
tonight with another pancake - I admit it I'm turning into a
food-a-holic!.  I feel as though I've been let out of a cage!
Seriously though, it's great to be able to eat and not end up in
varying stages of sickness because of food.  I really was getting to
the stage where I thought I'd just stay in bed and drink water and
juices until I got better!  I'm still not 100% convinced, it's hard
after 31/2 years of chronic illness, but the results are better than
anything I've done in the past (except fasting, when I wasn't eating
at all so no food was affecting my bowel).  I did have some good
effect with the yeast free diet but that was because I was eating a
lot less carbohydrates (almost none) and therefore the food was
passing through more quickly and had less time to sit there and
irritate the lining of my bowel. Also I still had to drinks gallons
of water a day to go to the toilet (when I didn't have diarrohea).


<P>The yeast free diet is similar to this except even more things in the
vegie dept. are prohibited in this diet initially, but other things
can be eaten (such as refined sugar and lots of potatoes and carbs).
Between 2 and 6 weeks, if I feel a lot better, I can start to
reintroduce foods, one at a time, and see if I have a reaction. They
give you little capsules with very concentrated amounts in them to 
try and you wait for three days and see what happens.


<P>Another plus is that I'm actually getting starting to feel hungry
again.  My partner keeps thinking someone's going to knock him over
the head and he'll wake up.  He's suffered as much as me in some
ways, not bodily but emotionally, seeing me so sick, not to mention
putting up with my constant moaning and groaning!


<P>I forgot to mention in my initial posting that when my gastro.
recommended I go there, he said was telling me about another very
sick female patient, who some days was too ill to get out of bed,
and she felt almost 100% better since going on this diet.  Of course
I wouldn't believe she could be as sick as me! Also he said that 1 in
2 of his IBD patients are relieved of their symptoms with this.  I
hope I'm in the right half!

<P>Dear Jackie,
In an earlier posting you metioned that you've not read Elaine's book. I
highly recommend that you do. It has given a lot of people a lot of
releif
from their IBD. It disallows a lot of the food you mention, but I still
think you would find the book of major interest.
Before I was finally diagnosed with UC (probably about 10 or 11 years
ago),
I ate evrything because I didn't know that food was causing my distress.
When I started to realize that there might be a connection, I started to
try to change my diet, but because I had no knowledge of what I should
or
shouldn't eat, it was a disaster. I was literally hemmoraging to death.
Finally when I was hospitalized, they put me on a bland diet. A lot of
what
you mention was on it and it did seem to quiet things down a bit. I
lived
on pancakes, white rice, white sugar and the likes. When you read
Elaine's
book you will find that these things actually feed the disease. I was
very
skepital going into the diet and would certainly have not even tried it
if
I hadn't spoken to someone who had crohns and had miraculous results on
the
diet. I'll be on the diet for 3 years on May 1st. In the first year I
had
an occasional symptom, mostly when I had inadvertantly strayed a bit
(resteraunt or a well meaning hostess). In the past 2 years I've been
totally symptom free.
If you are interested, and have a problem locating the book, please let
me
know.

Subject: <B>Re: my diet<BR></B>

<P>Dear Rachel and SCD list,


<P>The SCD diet has worked well for me. Elaine is a genius and has quite
simply
come up with a palatable paleo diet, which in reality, almost everyone
should be on.(for maximum health)  Wheat and other grains stress out the
immune system of all hominids, not just IBD victims.


<P>I have also tried it on my son, with the following problems:


<P>He has tested very allergic to casein (milk protein) so how can I put
him on
the dairy acidophilus?


<P>I also can't do the yogurt/dry curd cottage cheese/ etc. Years of
leaky gut
from antibiotics have created antibodies in his blood to dairy. 


<P>What I have done so far with him is adapt the SCD diet to make it
even more
paleo, no dairy products, no  dairy acidophilus.


<P>Even the non-dairy Natren are in a legume base, other non dairy
acidophilus
are in a malto-dextro base.[dextro sounds like sugar?]


<P>I have him on a different pro-biotic called Soil Based Organisms.
This is a
fomula of some acidophilus with also some soil bacteria. Think about it,
paleo man got a lot more soil (or dirt) in his diet. I watched a show on
TV
showing some hunter gatherer tribes in the Amazon and they lived/ate
filth
and looked completely happy and healthy. There are no dishwashers or
other
sanitation there ---- the human body historically has gotten a lot more
soil
based bacteria in it. 


<P>I would prefer him to be on nothing, a totally natural diet, I have
him on
these (SBOs) out of sheer desperation. 


<P>I find if I take him off the soil based, the diarrhea comes right
back. The
soil based help get rid of the diarrhea and he seems to digest better.
(How
would you like to clean up diarrhea 5 times a day!!)


<P>Also, there is new research in the UK coming out in the prestigious 
LANCET
Magazine in February linking the MMR vaccine to Crohns disease. The
measles
vaccine lodges in the lymph nodes of the intestines and creates
disease/havoc. Many (not all) people with Crohns may have very high
measles
titers in their blood from the MMR vaccine.


<P>Many kids labelled as &quot;autistic&quot; have brain damage because
they can't digest
(measles in bowel's lymph nodes  inflaming bowel) and the brain is not
nourished, whence the so-called autism or brain damage. In the UK a
group of
parents are suing the MMR vaccine mfg as their kids were born normal and
regressed into autism following the MMR. Dr Wakefield showed pictures of
the
bowels of the MMR victims and they were  like hamburger.


<P>I believe my son may have this, but so much of this info is cutting
edge and
I have already exhausted my funds on doctors. Even alternative docs
can't
help us so far.


<P>A person who gets Crohns later in life may have had a booster shot
(?) with
measles in it??


<P>Of course I am not saying that MMR is the only cause of Crohns, just
one of
many.


<P>Anyway, would appreciate ANY help and ideas for my son. He was born
completely normal, bright eyed and bushy tailed, became an absolute
wreck
from vaccines/antibiotics.


<P>Thank you to all on the List!!

<P>Dear All,<BR>
Yesterday was one week since I'd written you to tell you that the list
would have to shut down due to lack of finances. Well, starting
Thursday, I
started getting checks &amp; letters from you guys (4 days of mail).
I've
gotten 15 checks ranging from $5 to $40 and totalling $295!!! It looks
like
we are now working on year #2. At the end of the week I'll send a check
to
the list server for whatever I've gotten by then &amp; let you all know
how
much is covered. Your letters have amazed and touched me deeply. I don't
even KNOW most of the names who refer to themselves as &quot;silent
participants&quot; and &quot;silent members&quot;. If I've ever wondered
(and I have)
about the importance fo this list to all of you, I can no longer have
any
doubts.<BR>
 As I've written before, the SCD has worked miracles in my life and
creating this forum was my way of sharing that miracle with all of you.
I
have to admit that knowing the results of absolute adherence to this
diet,
has occasionally made me somewhat impatient with questions like
&quot;why do we
have to do it this way?&quot; or &quot;why can't we try it that
way?&quot;, but its
obvious that even those of you with questions about the diet itself
(which
I don't always have the scientific background to answer), see value in
the
diet. Many of you, like me, just know it works.<BR>
In any case, due to your wonderful response, we've got this home, for
what
seems to be, many months to come.<BR>
Love, Rachel<BR>

Subject: <B>Re: Low Energy<BR></B>

<P>Hi Sanford,  I have been on the scd since august '97 and also
experienced very
low energy since then.  I found that I was not actually eating enough
food,
period, but also, not enough carbos because of all the scd restrictions.
Two
weeks ago, I was consulting with an acupuncturist about other issues and
she
suggested I see a naturopath she recommended due to that person's
expertise on
&quot;The Zone&quot; diet. The &quot;Zone&quot; is a carefully
calibrated food program in which
you make sure that each meal has a particular and consistent balance
among
carbos, protein and fat/other.  Her only reason for suggesting I look at
it is
to make sure my scd meals have that important balance. I found the
naturopath's advice very helpful and have been measuring my legal scd
foods
for each meal since and can already tell a difference in my energy, even
tho'
I still have digestive symptoms.  


<P>A very quick run-down of the program is that you need to make each
meal
consist of 40% carbos, 30%protein and no more than 30%fat/other (i.e.
like
tomatoes, lettuce and scd-mayo on a &quot;sandwich&quot;). A
&quot;standard&quot; meal is what is
called a &quot;3-block&quot; meal: you eat 3 blocks of carbo, 3 of
protein and 3 of
fat/other (there are restrictions on how much of fat/other is fat rather
than
other, naturally!)  A &quot;block&quot; is equal to 9 grams of carbo,
which seems to
usually come close to abt 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 cup of any given legal
vegetable, and
abt. 1-11/2 oz of protein (i.e.meat/fish), or 7 grams of protein.  The
&quot;fat&quot;
part usually is given as abt 1/3 tsp for one block.  So you can figure
that a
3 block meal is abt 3-4 cups of veges and 3-4.5 oz of protein with the
allowed
1 tsp of fat.  But on the scd, since we get no complex carbos or
processed
foods, I let myself have more fat than that and I'm now maintaining my
historical set point of weight.  I also mix my veges so I don't have to
eat
3-4 cups of the same veg. at one meal.


<P>You might want to pick up the book just to flip through it or, ask
around for
a naturopath or dietician/ nutritionist who know the &quot;Zone&quot;
well and can help
you balance your intake.  It's still early days on this
&quot;block&quot; plan for me,
but using it and the scd seems to slowly be building my energy.  (I also
only
eat cooked foods, no raw fruit, veges or nuts and no yogurt yet).   
Good
luck,     &nbsp; Liz

<P>Jane, 


<P>My husband and I have both experienced very low levels of energy (me
when I
was pregnant) and couldn't seem to find anything that would help.  Then
we
were introduced to liquid minerals marketed by Equinox International. 
We had
tried other minerals to no avail, but this stuff really helped a lot! 
My baby
became more active in the womb (actually did not stop moving for about 3
days)
and I got a little concerned.  I talked to my doc and he said that was
fine, I
probably was needing those minerals.  Needless to say, I got the energy
I
needed to carry me through the third trimester.  My husband has been up
and
down due to UC, but the minerals also help to boost his energy.


<P>We did become representatives to market this product along with their
other
fine products, but that is not why I am telling you about it.  It
matters not
to me whether you decide to take it or not, I'm just sharing my own
experience.

<P>I recently accidently came across a guy, a Phd, who works at the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who sent me an
abstract on new research linking Blastocystis and IBD from 'Medline'.
I think it's fairly recent.  The research was conducted in Pakistan
and London. Thought some of you may have been diagnosed with this
particular parasite so here goes:</FONT>





<P><B>Significantly increased IgG2 subclass antibody levels to
Blastocystis hominis in patients with irritable bowel
syndrome.


<P>Am J Trop Med Hyg 1997 Mar;56(3):301-306 </B>

<P><I>By Hussain R, Jaferi W, Zuberi S, Baqai R, Abrar N, Ahmed
A, Zaman V</I>

<P>Blastocystis hominis is a common intestinal parasite of
humans in the tropics whose pathogenic role is in
dispute. Its presence has been reported in a variety of
intestinal disorders resembling irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS) such as diarrhea, anorexia, and flatulence. We
have therefore investigated a possible link between IBS
and blastocystosis by determining IgG antibody levels to
B. hominis in patients with IBS. Levels of IgG
antibodies were significantly elevated in patients with
IBS compared with asymptomatic controls (P &lt; 0.0001, by
Student's t-test) in both B. hominis stool
culture-positive and stool culture-negative IBS
patients. When IgG antibodies were divided into their
respective subclasses, only IgG2 levels were
significantly increased in IBS patients compared with
asymptomatic controls, indicating that the predominant
response in these patients may be directed to
carbohydrate antigens. The diagnostic usefulness of this
test in IBS patients remains to be established because
these data are only suggestive of a possible link
between B. hominis and IBS. However, we hope that this
antibody test will help in elucidating the controversy
that surrounds the role of B. hominis as a pathogen at
present.&gt;

<P>hi,


<P>doctors for the most part will only do what the FDA says they should,
but the researchers are not
totally ignoring the bacteria connection.  for example, just recently
Sartor in The American Journal
of Gastroenterlogy (1997 Dec;92(12Suppl):5S-11S ) stated the three
theories for the etiology of
IBD


<P>1) reaction to a presistent intestional infection


<P>2) exsistence of a defective mucosal barrier to luminal antigens  


<P>3) a dysregulated host immune respones to ubiquitous antigens


<P>ALL three are related to some kind of bacteria/protozoa/yeast etc ...


<P>in a similar vein Dr Hanauer, Univeristy of Chicago, who
&quot;discovered&quot; UC
refered a patient to a Dr McCann and this Dr McCann successfully
repopulated
the patient's bowel with friendly E. Coli strains which caused a four
year state 
of remission. that was reported in 1994, (sadly, nothing more
as been published on this technique since.)


<P>so orthodox medicine is coming around, slowly, but not before it's
proved to &quot;death&quot;.

<P><B>Action of phenolic derivatives (acetaminophen, salicylate, and
5-aminosalicylate) as
inhibitors of membrane lipid peroxidation and as peroxyl radical
scavengers.</B>


<P><I>By Dinis TC, Maderia VM, Almeida LM


<P>Laboratorio de Bioquimica, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade de
Coimbra, Portugal. </I>


<P>The action of the phenolic compounds acetaminophen, salicylate, and
5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) as inhibitors of lipid peroxidation was
studied under conditions suitable for establishing their antioxidant
potencies. These phenolic compounds react differently with
diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and protect differently sarcoplasmic
reticulum membranes against lipid peroxidation induced by
Fe2+/ascorbate, as evaluated by the formation of thiobarbituric
acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and by the loss of the
polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains. 5-Aminosalicylate reacts promptly
with DPPH, suggesting a potent radical scavenger activity and
was found to be the most active in inhibiting Fe2+/ascorbate-induced
lipid peroxidation. These compounds also exhibit peroxyl radical
scavenging activity generated by the water-soluble
2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) azoinitiator of peroxyl
radicals, as
evidenced by the inhibition of cis-parinaric acid fluorescence decay or
oxygen consumption. 5-ASA rapidly scavenges peroxyl radicals in
the aqueous phase, producing a concentration-dependent inhibition period
similar to Trolox or cysteine, suggesting an antioxidant
activity of chain-breaking type. By comparison, the reactivities of
acetaminophen and salicylate are significantly weaker, acting
essentially as oxidation retardants. Although closely related in
structure, the antioxidant efficiencies of the three phenolic compounds
are
significantly different. The higher antioxidant activity of 5-ASA is
putatively related with the p-amine relative to the hydroxyl group,
potentially increasing the stability of the phenoxyl radical. Such a
stabilization is not possible with salicylate and is decreased in
acetaminophen by an electron withdrawing effect of the p-acetyl.

Re muscle cramps, I too have these and just today bought potassium

as a supplement to my SCD diet as I'm not getting much potassium...no
potatoes, no bananas, etc. (no starches, no fruits).  We'll see how it
works.


<P>Re the cheesecake recipe, I make at least one a week and it's
wonderful,
but I did alter it slightly, after experimenting with several different
methods:


<P>Instead of 2 cups DCCC, use slightly more (makes it more creamy)
about 1/4
cup to 1/2 cup more total.  Make sure you are packing it down in the
measuring cup.


<P>Bake in a glass pie plate.  The cheesecake consistency doesn't do
well if
baked thicker.


<P>Instead of 2 teaspoons vanilla extract


<P>reduce to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<BR>
Add 1 teaspoon almond extract<BR>
Add 1 teaspoon lemon extract (if not using the grated skin of a
lemon)<BR>


<P>I use the lemon extract, because it's faster and easier to digest.

&gt; this glaring omission?<BR>
&gt; -Mike Simons<BR>
&gt;<BR></FONT>


<P>
Mike Simons makes a good point. The SCD is conspicuously missing from
the
CCFA pages.


<P>The CCFA does not serve itself well by omitting reference on the one
hand to
such a successful diet, while on the other hand stressing pharmaceutical
and
surgical remedies. In my humble opinion, this omission exposes a bias
toward
filling certain pockets instead of a general interest in curing
patients. It
is easy to see that the CCFA pages reflect a strictly physicians point
of
view.


<P>Those of us who have benefited from the SCD already know the dietary
approach is a significant omission in the world of modern medicine. The
dietary cure is not popular in the world of mainstream medicine. First
because the results are not always repeatable, secondly because a
dieting
regime is not a money maker for the medical/pharmaceutical industry.


<P>The diet based cure actually competes with the pharmaceutical
industry.
Investors in the pharmaceutical industry could be weary of potentially
successful diet based cures that could cut into the return on their
investments. A reasonable and a legitimate position to take also for
those
who make a living treating patients, such as physicians and surgeons.


<P>A dietary cure on the other hand could be mostly of interest to
patients,
the suffering lot of us, and the few good souls (including doctors) who
are
on the information service circuit. We need to find ways of helping
those
that help us with diets that work. Money makes the world go round and
clearly a patient's interests are financially somewhat different from
those
who make a living out of treating patients. These are the realities of
the
present day competitive society in which we live.


<P>Elaine Gottschall's SCD and these WEB pages have been a real help in
my
personal struggle with the disease. Here in these pages is help and
support
that is simply not available anywhere else. Certainly not at my doctor's
office.


<P>I have found the SCD Web Library site
http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/ to be
full of helpful information. Needless to say the CCFA site is not one of
my
favorite bookmarks.

<P>Dear all,
I just opened the mail and you've sent enough money at this point to
keep
the list alive for the next 4 and 1/2 months. You guys are the best. At
this rate we'll have the year paid up in no time.
I got something else interesting in the mail. When I was first diagnosed
many years ago, I subscibed to the CCFA. I've stopped supporting them
ever
since I found out that they have no interst in backing or even
researching
the SCD. However I sent them enough money to keep me on their mailing
list
til the end of '99. This means that at least once a month I get a letter
from them asking for money. I also get a newsletter from them full of
stories about how brave people adjusting to life with IBD. I have no
interest in learning how to live with it. I want it out of my life.
Thank
the powers that be that the SCD helps me to accomplish this. So anyways
all
the years of getting mail from them has finally produced a gift. Along
with
their letter asking for money, they sent me an accessory that no well
dressed IBDer should leave home without. It is a card to be kept in the
wallet for emergencies and it reads as follows;


<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica, arial">I CAN'T WAIT<BR>
The bearer of this card has a medical<BR>
condition that requires him/her to use<BR>
bathroom facilities urgently.<BR>
Thank you for your cooperation.<BR></FONT></B>
CCFA<BR>


<P>I apoligize for my sarcasm to those of you who beleive that this card
would
be useful to them, but personally I think that the millions that the
CCFA
collects would be put to much better use in finding a cure than by
issueing
a card that I think most shopkeepers would be horrified to be faced
with. I
could just read their thoughts; &quot;oh yeah, sure, you can go stink up
my
bathroom&quot; or worse yet, the totally uneducated ones, &quot;yeah and
just what
kind of horrible disease did you think you were going to leave
behind&quot;. It
makes me think of the guy in an airport or train station passing out
cards
that read &quot;I can't support my family, please give me money&quot;.
Sorry, but to
me IBD carries enough pain and humiliation without the additional
implications of a card like this. Just my sentiments.
Love Rachel

<P>It is my understanding that the body will develop allergies to foods
that are
eaten with continued frequency.  I used to eat too much chicken and
potatoes
and my allergy tests were 4 on a scale of 4 for allergy for chicken and
potatoes.  I stopped eating my allergic foods, gave my body a chance to
clear
out and now I can eat these foods but on a three day alternating
schedule.
The three day time frame supposedly allows my body to not start building
up an
allergen to the foods again.  Alternating is fairly easy, I just
remember not
to eat something again for three days.  I also have to watch out for
food
families.  I can't eat brussel sprouts within three days of eating
broccoli
(same family).  

Weight loss:  I go to all bones on no flour products or pastas.  I had
to find
rice flour breads, waffles and pastas.  I am gluten allergic and was
getting
too too thin on no flour products.  I am careful to not eat any gluten
flour
product.
