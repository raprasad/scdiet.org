&gt; Also, SCD tends to be a fairly low residue<BR>
&gt;type diet so it will not cause there to be huge amounts of stool. At<BR>
&gt;least it does not with me. Perhaps, others can comment on this too??<BR>
snip<BR>
&gt;Whatever, I would encourage you to fell encouraged with the progress<BR>
&gt;that you are experiencing with your son! Hang in there!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Pat<BR>
Pat and the group.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you Pat for inviting comments on the above statement, it allows me<BR>
the opportunity to reply to the subject without feeling I am being<BR>
controversial.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after reaching a point where the Ulcerative Colitis showed signs<BR>
of improvement and even to this day in full remission I am always amazed at<BR>
the large volume of stool that I produce on the SCDiet. I would estimate<BR>
some thing in the order of three times the volume as when pre SCD days. With<BR>
regularity to the hour once each day, absolutely no discomfort and easily<BR>
passed. Well formed but not as a hard material .<BR>
I remain on the SCDiet to-day, (other than one small square of chocolate<BR>
some days) I eat more than my share of nuts, approx 2 teaspoons of honey a<BR>
day perhaphs 4 to 6 apples 2 or 3 bannanas, some days oranges. But the main<BR>
stay is mixed vegetables. I alternated between frozen for one meal then for<BR>
the next meal I will eat fresh chopped up vegetables cooked up in olive oil.<BR>
All types of squashes, meat , chicken, or fish every day . I do notice the<BR>
stool will reflect any changes I might make to the above diet.<BR>
eg. if I eat a larger amout of meat than I would normally or unbalance the<BR>
fruits and vegetables. My bads habits ..... I drink 3 or more cups of weak<BR>
coffee a day and other than the liquid in it I dont need it and may have to<BR>
stop. I do feel great most of the time .<BR>
<BR>
I am wondering if any one else in the group has found the same?<BR>

&gt;You mentioned making a custard from persimmon pulp. Do you have this<BR>
&gt;recipe to share? I absolutely LOVE persimmons and would appreciate this<BR>
&gt;recipe<BR>
&gt;and any others for persimmons. Think you can freeze persimmon pulp?<BR>
&gt;Linda<BR>
<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
Sorry for the long delay. I was referring to taking the persimmon pulp raw<BR>
(my dietary preference) and whipping or pureeing it. Then setting it in a<BR>
crust of raw ground brazils, walnuts, or whatever nut agrees with the<BR>
person. They are so good it is not worth adding seasoning as far as i'm<BR>
concerned.<BR>
I did find some cooked recipes from friends and both contain sugar and one<BR>
contains flour. If you know how to redux the sugar with raw honey, (the<BR>
flour isn't a problem you can use almond etc), let me know and I will post<BR>
them. also they have rum in them and would need a sub for that or leave it<BR>
out.<BR>

Dear Pat,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks SO MUCH for the info about calcium lactate, I read in Elaine's book<BR>
that children/babies may need extra calcium, so I gave him this, never even<BR>
thinking about lactose! Thanks so much.<BR>
<BR>
I think now that you mention it she recommends calcium AEP in the book, will<BR>
look for it.<BR>
<BR>
I need some advice on vitamins/minerals. Should I get the vitamins from<BR>
Freeda, or is there a brand available at the health food store? Also, do<BR>
most of you find you need a B12 shot, as in the book she mentioned that some<BR>
people do need a boost of their B12. Does anyone have any brands of calcium<BR>
(AEP) that they recommend.<BR>
<BR>
How do you know if you need a B12 shot?<BR>
<BR>
As far as soil based and olive leaf extract, it was my understanding that<BR>
Elaine was NOT for them. It was my feeling she was very strongly against them.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the parents of autistic kids are having great results with soil<BR>
based organisms, they replace the yeast and bad bacteria in the intestine,<BR>
so I am very torn on this issue. My best friend up in Washington is having<BR>
great results, as are others. She gave her son SBOs and then tested his<BR>
urine and his yeast and bad bacteria were nearly gone.<BR>
<BR>
I am wondering if our kids have had SO MANY antibiotics that they may need a<BR>
boost from the soil based to get rid of the dysbiosis, and then MAINTAIN the<BR>
new flora with Elaine's diet. What does the List think?<BR>
<BR>
Do you think it is ok to give him some garlic, I tried some raw garlic<BR>
myself and wow, talk about die off, I only took about half a clove and had<BR>
MAJOR die off the next day!<BR>
<BR>
I read in a book on garlic that aged garlic is better for candida, do you<BR>
know what kind to get?<BR>
<BR>
His stomach is distended and hard like a balloon, even though he is very<BR>
thin. My other kids have soft stomachs/abdomens. Would this be an indication<BR>
of yeast or bad bacteria or both??<BR>
<BR>
I KNOW my son is not autistic, he has incredibly bad dysbiosis due to yeast,<BR>
bacteria, or, some research is showing, the MMR vaccine invading the lymph<BR>
nodes of the colon and damaging it. In any case, I need to get to the bottom<BR>
of this dysbiosis. Soil based organisms are also curing Crohns disease, so<BR>
my friend in Washington State said.<BR>
<BR>
In case you guys did not know this, the so called &quot;autism&quot; diagnosis is<BR>
absolutely booming, some say as a result of very early and very intensive<BR>
vaccinations., which disrupt the normal immune system,which then predispose<BR>
the baby to infections, which lead to antibiotics, which lead to dysbiosis,<BR>
which leads to toxins in the blood affecting the brain, etc.<BR>
<BR>
If anyone has any advice, I am kind of desperate, my son is stimming<BR>
(obsessing) on fans again.<BR>
<BR>
Could my giving him calcium lactate have screwed up the diet enough to make<BR>
him worse??<BR>
<BR>
What happened to the article on dysbiosis, is it coming?<BR>
<BR>
Again thanks,<BR>
<BR>

im sticking with the original recipe! this bread fell apart all to hell! what<BR>
i would also like to try is the banana bread recipe OMITTING the bananas and<BR>
the sweet stuff and see if a regular bread would turn out just as soft. may<BR>
have to add another egg? dont know but want to try getting a softer bread and<BR>

&gt; Has anyone been on 6MP for CD and fistulas and then gone on the SCD? <BR>
<BR>
&lt;snip&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Wayne,<BR>
<BR>
I have CD, three fistulas that had minds of their own and have been<BR>
following the SCD since March/97. I have continued pressure from my<BR>
GI to begin 6-MP therapy for the closure of fistulas. I refuse and<BR>
this drives him nuts :-) In my research on this drug and it's<BR>
successes for fistula closure I concluded that it works in approx. 50%<BR>
of the cases...not good enough for me...the 'Drug Chicken' Hehehe. I<BR>
continue to decline 6-MP.<BR>
<BR>
In my personal experience, fistula activity begins when my <BR>
prostaglandin levels drop to nil. ( a woman thing ). I studied<BR>
prostaglandin and low and behold it is a cortisone like hormone<BR>
secreted from the the body to contol inflammation of the bodies<BR>
organs. This finding led me to an 'alternative' source of cortisone.<BR>
I tried Cat's claw.....nothing...tried Androsone.....nothing....tried<BR>
veggie juicing.....nothing....read a study on the use of Omega 3 fatty<BR>
acids ( Fish oil and Flax oil are good sources) as an assistant to the<BR>
bodies *natural* abilities to fight inflamation........Bingo!, eight<BR>
hours after trying plain ol' cheap brand fish oil I had a huge energy<BR>
increase. I did this last June and played around with the dosages and<BR>
as I continued the usage I also found the Omegas 3 acted well as<BR>
Prednisone would and the fistulas began to settle down.. <BR>
<BR>
I use 4000mg of deep sea cold pressed Fish Oil per day when fistulas<BR>
are not active, when they start to open up I immediately up the dose<BR>
to 6000mg per day and they settle down in two days. ( This dosage<BR>
suits *MY* height, weight, age and other lifestyle factors )<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion ( geez, I sound like a Professor of something-or-other!<BR>
...I'm not...just a Mom with CD that is frightened of chemical drugs)<BR>
I know the fish oil did not *cure* the fistula, but I like having some<BR>
contol over the little buggers just the same. And in the long run the<BR>
toxins of 6-MP will not be in me to interfere in other ways.<BR>
<BR>
FWIW!<BR>

P.S. Garlic will help ward off infection when the fistulas become<BR>
active.<BR>

&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; Dear Pat,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks SO MUCH for the info about calcium lactate, I read in Elaine's<BR>
&gt; book<BR>
&gt; that children/babies may need extra calcium, so I gave him this, never<BR>
&gt; even<BR>
&gt; thinking about lactose! Thanks so much. [Pat Sullivan] Your welcome! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think now that you mention it she recommends calcium AEP in the<BR>
&gt; book, will<BR>
&gt; look for it. [Pat Sullivan] Actually, I don't see where she mentions<BR>
&gt; AEP specifically. This is something I read elswhere and don't<BR>
&gt; remember where. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I need some advice on vitamins/minerals. Should I get the vitamins<BR>
&gt; from<BR>
&gt; Freeda, or is there a brand available at the health food store? Also,<BR>
&gt; do<BR>
&gt; most of you find you need a B12 shot, as in the book she mentioned<BR>
&gt; that some<BR>
&gt; people do need a boost of their B12. Does anyone have any brands of<BR>
&gt; calcium<BR>
&gt; (AEP) that they recommend. [Pat Sullivan] Personally, I am currently<BR>
&gt; using vitamins and minerals called Matrix which I get from Peak Energy<BR>
&gt; 1-800-331-2303. Like Elaine recommends, these are low dosage but are<BR>
&gt; supposed to be extremely well absorbed and are all in the &quot;active&quot;<BR>
&gt; forms, expecially the minerals. This company focuses on dealing with<BR>
&gt; Mercury Toxic individuals and thus they recommend very low dosages of<BR>
&gt; B12 since it is supposed to &quot;methylate&quot; mercury which in their minds<BR>
&gt; is bad since methyl mercury is 50 - 100 times more toxic than straight<BR>
&gt; mercury. I am not aware that I need more b12 as I have not been<BR>
&gt; tested. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; How do you know if you need a B12 shot? [Pat Sullivan] There are<BR>
&gt; tests that a doctor can do to determine levels of b12 and whether or<BR>
&gt; not you need injections. They also look for anemia as low b12 is one<BR>
&gt; of the causes of anemia <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; As far as soil based and olive leaf extract, it was my understanding<BR>
&gt; that<BR>
&gt; Elaine was NOT for them. It was my feeling she was very strongly<BR>
&gt; against them. [Pat Sullivan] If so, it is not in her book and I don't<BR>
&gt; remember reading it here. I've only been on this list for about 45<BR>
&gt; days so it could be previous to that.She obviously highly recommends<BR>
&gt; Yoghurt which carries lots of these types of bacterias into the<BR>
&gt; intestinal tract. In my case, I still cannot yet tolerate Yoghurt or<BR>
&gt; cheese and thus am missing out on this important element unless I take<BR>
&gt; them in capsule or powder form, which I do.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Some of the parents of autistic kids are having great results with<BR>
&gt; soil<BR>
&gt; based organisms, they replace the yeast and bad bacteria in the<BR>
&gt; intestine,<BR>
&gt; so I am very torn on this issue. My best friend up in Washington is<BR>
&gt; having<BR>
&gt; great results, as are others. She gave her son SBOs and then tested<BR>
&gt; his<BR>
&gt; urine and his yeast and bad bacteria were nearly gone. [Pat Sullivan]<BR>
&gt; I would go with this if I were you! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I am wondering if our kids have had SO MANY antibiotics that they may<BR>
&gt; need a<BR>
&gt; boost from the soil based to get rid of the dysbiosis, and then<BR>
&gt; MAINTAIN the<BR>
&gt; new flora with Elaine's diet. What does the List think? [Pat<BR>
&gt; Sullivan] I think you are correct and unless Elaine has a contrary<BR>
&gt; opinion I would go with what is working for others in the treatment of<BR>
&gt; your son. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Do you think it is ok to give him some garlic, I tried some raw garlic<BR>
&gt; myself and wow, talk about die off, I only took about half a clove and<BR>
&gt; had<BR>
&gt; MAJOR die off the next day! [Pat Sullivan] Small amounts and then<BR>
&gt; gradually build up! Garlic is extremley effective as you discovered.<BR>
&gt; I would certainly recommend it for you but start slow and then<BR>
&gt; gradually add more! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I read in a book on garlic that aged garlic is better for candida, do<BR>
&gt; you<BR>
&gt; know what kind to get? [Pat Sullivan] Kyolic Aged Garlic is usually<BR>
&gt; the one recommended. Most non-liquid garlic, including Kyolic powders<BR>
&gt; have non SCD allowed stuff added to it! I use a lot of Kyolic Liq.<BR>
&gt; Garlic and notice a difference when I forget to take it or when I<BR>
&gt; travel and forget it at home. The Liquid can be hidden in foodstuffs<BR>
&gt; to, or put in capsules for your son. Raw garlic in caps is also very<BR>
&gt; effective and cheap! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; His stomach is distended and hard like a balloon, even though he is<BR>
&gt; very<BR>
&gt; thin. My other kids have soft stomachs/abdomens. Would this be an<BR>
&gt; indication<BR>
&gt; of yeast or bad bacteria or both?? [Pat Sullivan] Yes, from<BR>
&gt; everything I have read. This is common symptom of major dysbiosis<BR>
&gt; including candida, bacteria and parasites all of which both garlic and<BR>
&gt; olive leaf extract deals with. I use both! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I KNOW my son is not autistic, he has incredibly bad dysbiosis due to<BR>
&gt; yeast,<BR>
&gt; bacteria, or, some research is showing, the MMR vaccine invading the<BR>
&gt; lymph<BR>
&gt; nodes of the colon and damaging it. In any case, I need to get to the<BR>
&gt; bottom<BR>
&gt; of this dysbiosis. Soil based organisms are also curing Crohns<BR>
&gt; disease, so<BR>
&gt; my friend in Washington State said. [Pat Sullivan] Go with it! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; In case you guys did not know this, the so called &quot;autism&quot; diagnosis<BR>
&gt; is<BR>
&gt; absolutely booming, some say as a result of very early and very<BR>
&gt; intensive<BR>

&gt; predispose<BR>
&gt; the baby to infections, which lead to antibiotics, which lead to<BR>
&gt; dysbiosis,<BR>
&gt; which leads to toxins in the blood affecting the brain, etc. [Pat<BR>
&gt; Sullivan] Great desciption. Our kids are being hurt at a very early<BR>
&gt; age. Consider the tremendous increase in ADD which also usually<BR>
&gt; responds very well to Diet and dysbiosis treatment! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; If anyone has any advice, I am kind of desperate, my son is stimming<BR>
&gt; (obsessing) on fans again.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Could my giving him calcium lactate have screwed up the diet enough to<BR>
&gt; make<BR>
&gt; him worse?? [Pat Sullivan] Absolutely! Lactose is very bad! DON'T<BR>
&gt; beat yourself up over it though. You did not know and now can quickly<BR>
&gt; get back on track. Mistakes are part of the process of learning! <BR>

Dear SCDers,<BR>
<BR>
I have continued doing a lot of research on mercury amalgams and the<BR>
possible affect that it may be having on my own health problems. The<BR>
following are some results and thoughts about this that may be of<BR>
interest to you.<BR>
<BR>
1.) I have had a hair mineral analysis done showing very high levels of<BR>
mercury in my system.<BR>
<BR>
2.) I have had what is called a DPMS mercury challenge test confirming<BR>
once again that I have a very high level of Hg in my body.<BR>
<BR>
3.) I had my amalgams out over 10 years ago. The doctor who tested me<BR>
said that unless I have done a very determined &quot;detox&quot;, that mercury<BR>
exits the body very slowly.<BR>
<BR>
4.) It is likely that my consistent eating of fish (it is supposed to be<BR>
healthy and is, except for proven high levels of mercury) has continued<BR>
to regularly expose me to Hg keeping my levels very high in spite of<BR>
having my amalgams out.<BR>
<BR>
5.) There is no question that all amalgams leech Hg beginning the day<BR>
they are put in! Many, many (hundreds)of well documented studies on<BR>
this.<BR>
<BR>
6.) There are 2 very new studies, one done at the University of<BR>
Kentucky, clearly linking mercury amalgams to Alzheimers disease and<BR>
another done showing that intestinal bacteria exposed to Hg readily<BR>
develop resistance to antibiotics. It is felt by many researchers that<BR>
the heavy use of mercury amalgams is more responsible for antibiotic<BR>
resistance than is the over usage of antibiotics themselves.<BR>
<BR>
7.) Almost everything I read talks about mercury's affinity for the GI<BR>
tract and is considered as a causative agent in many GI tract diseases.<BR>
<BR>
8.) Hg also has a high affinity for the brain, kidney and liver and is<BR>
considered to be the most toxic metal of all the heavy metals! It is a<BR>
very strong immune depressant allowing for other opportunistic<BR>
infections to have a field day.<BR>
<BR>
9.) When I did the survey here a few weeks ago, 100% of us had amlagams,<BR>
or used to have them. Only about 60-70% of the general population have<BR>
amalgams in their mouth. Statistically then, THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT!<BR>
<BR>
9.) I am NOT saying that amalgams are the cause of all our GI problems!<BR>
I am saying that this research is interesting and perhaps worth<BR>
considering for those of you who have not considered it before.<BR>
<BR>
10.) As I have mentioned before, Root Canals can be even more<BR>
devastating than mercury amalgams.<BR>
<BR>
11.) It is interesting to me that Elaine says in her book that she nor<BR>
anyone else knows exactly what starts the &quot;Vicious Cycle&quot; that we all<BR>
are treating so effectively with SCD. Is it possible that mercury is<BR>
one possible agent that starts it? Statistically, the growth of GI<BR>
diseases mirrors the growth in the usage of mercury amalgams. The same<BR>
is true with the growth of virtually all auto-immune diseases especially<BR>
MS, Lupus, Arthritis. When Hg gets into a cell the immune system<BR>
recognizes it as something foreign and then attacks it. If there is a<BR>
lot of Hg in the cells of the intestinal tract and the immune system no<BR>
longer recognizes it as &quot;self&quot; does it then attack it thus causing<BR>
damage to the GI tract as in &quot;leaky gut&quot; etc. This is just a theory,<BR>
but not one that I have developed all on my own. There is lots of<BR>
research suggesting what I say here.<BR>
<BR>
I am not trying to push anything on anyone, simply trying to inform for<BR>
your further consideration!<BR>

<BR>
thanks for the info. I might suggest that you use a brand of fish oil<BR>
that is labeled as containing no mercury. Usually ones that say<BR>
cholesterol free also have all Hg removed from them. Don't want to<BR>
trade one problem for another! Just something to consider!<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>

&gt; &gt;From: Wayne Young &lt;wyoung@ANET-DFW.COM&gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Has anyone been on 6MP for CD and fistulas and then gone on the SCD?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Wayne,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have CD, three fistulas that had minds of their own and have been<BR>
&gt; following the SCD since March/97. I have continued pressure from my<BR>
&gt; GI to begin 6-MP therapy for the closure of fistulas. I refuse and<BR>
&gt; this drives him nuts :-) In my research on this drug and it's<BR>
&gt; successes for fistula closure I concluded that it works in approx. 50%<BR>
&gt; of the cases...not good enough for me...the 'Drug Chicken' Hehehe. I<BR>
&gt; continue to decline 6-MP.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; In my personal experience, fistula activity begins when my <BR>
&gt; prostaglandin levels drop to nil. ( a woman thing ). I studied<BR>
&gt; prostaglandin and low and behold it is a cortisone like hormone<BR>
&gt; secreted from the the body to contol inflammation of the bodies<BR>
&gt; organs. This finding led me to an 'alternative' source of cortisone.<BR>
&gt; I tried Cat's claw.....nothing...tried Androsone.....nothing....tried<BR>
&gt; veggie juicing.....nothing....read a study on the use of Omega 3 fatty<BR>
&gt; acids ( Fish oil and Flax oil are good sources) as an assistant to the<BR>
&gt; bodies *natural* abilities to fight inflamation........Bingo!, eight<BR>
&gt; hours after trying plain ol' cheap brand fish oil I had a huge energy<BR>
&gt; increase. I did this last June and played around with the dosages and<BR>
&gt; as I continued the usage I also found the Omegas 3 acted well as<BR>
&gt; Prednisone would and the fistulas began to settle down.. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I use 4000mg of deep sea cold pressed Fish Oil per day when fistulas<BR>
&gt; are not active, when they start to open up I immediately up the dose<BR>
&gt; to 6000mg per day and they settle down in two days. ( This dosage<BR>
&gt; suits *MY* height, weight, age and other lifestyle factors )<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; In conclusion ( geez, I sound like a Professor of something-or-other!<BR>
&gt; ...I'm not...just a Mom with CD that is frightened of chemical drugs)<BR>
&gt; I know the fish oil did not *cure* the fistula, but I like having some<BR>
&gt; contol over the little buggers just the same. And in the long run the<BR>
&gt; toxins of 6-MP will not be in me to interfere in other ways.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; FWIW!<BR>

&gt; P.S. Garlic will help ward off infection when the fistulas become<BR>
&gt; active.<BR>
