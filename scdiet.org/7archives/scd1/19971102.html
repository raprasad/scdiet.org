Today, I was reading an advertisement for a newsletter from The Atkins<BR>
Health Center and I realized that when you compare SCD with &quot;The Zone&quot;,<BR>
&quot;Protien Power&quot;, &quot;The Atkins Diet&quot; (called the low carbohydrate diet)<BR>
and a diet I found in Hal Huggins book, &quot;It's All in Your Head&quot; they are<BR>
all very similar.<BR>
<BR>
I found this to be encouraging. I realized that SCD basically<BR>
represented the CORRECT way we should eat, not just something that we<BR>
should follow to get well and then back to the &quot;real way&quot; we should eat.<BR>
I realized that the perspective that I should stay on this diet until my<BR>
symptoms went away, and then I can gradually go back to a near &quot;normal&quot;<BR>
diet, as long as I stay away from sugar and white bread, has been the<BR>
major source of recurrent flares for me. We simply were not intended to<BR>
eat a whole lot of these types of foods, if at all. <BR>
<BR>
This is probably obvious to all of you, but I guess I am particularly<BR>
slow. I don't know if this will help anyone else, but I thought I'd<BR>
post it in case it might encourage someone else as much as it encouraged<BR>
me. For what it's worth...<BR>

I too have noticed seasonal variation on my UC, as well as smoking. I put<BR>
myself into remission once by smoking a strong cigarette every two waking<BR>
hours, along with the SCD. As I cut back, I started bleeding again. I've<BR>
quit smoking since then, and occasionally have some symptoms (a bit of<BR>
blood sporadically, and some energy loss) and most days are problem free.<BR>
I think I've achieved maximum benefit from the diet. I don't think smoking<BR>
is the way to go, neither is prednisone, but I do think either can help in<BR>
the short term. Both are hard to kick.<BR>
<BR>
Personnaly, I am not offended by anyone expressing their feelings about<BR>
their circumstances relative to their illness, even if they chose 4 or 6<BR>
letter words. I believe that we all have developed our own &quot;culture of<BR>
communication&quot; and it is both entertaining and educational (to me) to see<BR>
how others chose their words for expression and effect. <BR>
<BR>
If you put some fresh basil, garlic and pine nuts in a food processor, and<BR>
mix it in with your Lois Lang's bread batter, you will have a delicious<BR>
loaf of Pesto bread.<BR>

Starkist makes a &quot;lowfat, low sodium&quot; tuna which contains only tuna and<BR>

Since Coffee seems to irritate my colon, does anyone know of any thing<BR>
(besides more sleep) which can keep me alert inn the morning at my boring<BR>
job? Preferably legal on the diet and with the law!<BR>
<BR>
I am so amazed by the level of commitment evidenced by all the posts and<BR>
the level of support is so heartwarming. Keep it up!<BR>

Stay on the lookout for my Holiday SCD recipes posting which I am hoping<BR>
to find the time to put together. Anyone with any ideas for &quot;special&quot;<BR>

<BR>
I am baffled by the constant never-ending yoghurt this, yoghurt that...<BR>
for something so easy to prepare, so clearly outlined in the book...<BR>
<BR>
For those of you who have never tried braeburn or fiji apples, now is the<BR>
season! They are very delicious in my humble opinion.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; style. I just rememberred what I<BR>
wanted to say. I've got excema, and I'm sure it's almost an external<BR>
version of my colitis. Sounds weird, huh&gt;? But prednisone alleviates the<BR>
symptoms of both ailments, and both come back. The SCD works on my<BR>
colitis, but not on my excema. I'm thinking of seeing a homeopathic<BR>
specialist. for both UC and excema. Has anyone tried this route for<BR>
either?<BR>

Dear Pat,<BR>
I know exactly what you mean. I,ve never been looking for a diet to solve<BR>
just one problem, but have been a firm believer in treating the whole body for<BR>
optimal health and that would solve all the problems that I have since<BR>
everything is connected anyway. I think this diet is a little strict, as it<BR>
needs to be, to put the body back to working order. Following that with a<BR>
low-carbo diet for continued good health. I have a big question though.<BR>
Tonight for example - went out to dinner with friends. I had to ask certain<BR>
questions to order my dinner and of course people say - why that, or why did<BR>
you ask about etc, and don't you eat your rice or potato? They want to know<BR>
more about low-carbo diets and what books are good and how it effects their<BR>
HDL, they are so into the low fat thing. For people who do not have<BR>
intestinal disorders, or think they don't, which one of the low-carbo books<BR>
best describes a program that can be followed for general good health? I've<BR>
read the zone, and although there are similarities, I still think it leaves<BR>
too much room for carbos. I wonder what Elaine would recommend as a general<BR>
diet for people who are just afraid of heart disease and cancer ? I've been<BR>
on so many &quot;health diets&quot; (vegetarian, macrobiotics, candida, reversing heart<BR>
disease etc) my friends just nod when I tell them I have a new diet. By the<BR>
way, it seems to be working for me. Almost one month and I have much less<BR>
bloating and many less trips to the bathroom. Sorry I was so lengthy, I<BR>
guess it was the dry red wine at dinner. Take care, Jane<BR>

&gt;What do you guys think of juicing? I have been giving my son a juice of<BR>
&gt;carrots, celery, and kale, diluted at least 50% with water.<BR>

<BR>
How is your child to-day, better i would hope.<BR>
My opinion, the half juice and water are likely fine, as long as you do your<BR>
own juicing. Take it slow and try only one at a time.<BR>
I find two or three nice fresh carrots and one large apple juiced, make an<BR>
exellent tasting drink and with natural sugars it is a nice quick pick me<BR>

&gt;&gt;Dear William,<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;He is horribly allergic to dairy, I have held off so far on doing any of<BR>
&gt;the<BR>
&gt;&gt;yogurt or dry curd foods so far. Also, he does not tolerate nuts or eggs<BR>
&gt;&gt;well. So far, we have been eating lots of fish, meat, veggies, etc. very<BR>
&gt;&gt;little fruit, he has candida from years of antibiotics.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Moira<BR>
 Hi Moira:<BR>
Yes it is understandable that you are tired and discouraged. You must take<BR>
care of your own health, even more now that your work load is much heavier<BR>
than normal. I have always been of the opinion there should be a Metal of<BR>
Bravery in the Line of Duty for Mothers such as yourself.<BR>
PLEASE, if you have the book, (and if you dont be sure to get it) read<BR>
Breaking the Vicious Cycle, page 44 bottom half of page.<BR>
Re: yogurt and dry curd cottage cheese benifits.<BR>
Also Please read in same book page 56 bottom paragraph,<BR>
 Foods Not Permited<BR>
 Re: Milk products not allowed in this diet.<BR>
I would hope this will give you a better insight to why we on the diet can<BR>
eat dry curd cottage cheese and yoghurt. As well if you still have doubts<BR>
try to contact Elaine for her opinion.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;well. Sometimes I get discouraged.<BR>
&gt;&gt;Why do you think yogurt is so important???<BR>
&gt;&gt;Also, my own health is bad as I have spent 3 years at least chasing down<BR>
&gt;&gt;therapies for my son, I am hoping this is going to get him better, it<BR>
looks<BR>
&gt;&gt;like it will. But I am very fatigued from years of stress over this.<BR>
snip&gt;&gt;<BR>
 Good luck<BR>
I hope this will be of some benifit to you and your entire family.<BR>

eggs from her diet completely. I did and the excema was gone <BR>
shortly thereafter. It was an egg allergy.<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I just returned from a trip to see my doctors, and came across some vaulable<BR>
information you may find interesting. You may be familiar with some of these<BR>
supplements, but I included them anyway.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
CAT'S CLAW -- heals tumors, ulcers, and other inflamatory conditions,<BR>
stimulate the immune system in a manner as to increase phagocytic activity,<BR>
relieves symptoms of fibromyaglia, sytemic lupus, shingles, Crohn's muscle<BR>
pains and elevated cholesterol. It helps with various disorders including<BR>
leaky gut syndrome, diverticulosis, gastritis, Crohn's, and parasitic<BR>
problems. It rivals other herbs as well as OTC medicines in its influence on<BR>
cleansing the colon and restoring funciton, as well as correcting flora<BR>
imbalance.<BR>
<BR>
GLUCOSAMINE - a natural alternative for NSAIDs used for inflamation of<BR>
arthritis in the joints. IT encourages collagen growth, the principle<BR>
component of connective tissue. Other herbal supplements that aid in the<BR>
anti-inflamtory process include: YUCCA, DEVIL'S CLAW, BROMELAIN, and SEA<BR>
CUCUMBER.<BR>
<BR>
CURCUMIN - considered one of the nature's most powerful anti-inflamatory<BR>
agents,yet also very safe. Showed significant beneficial effects on<BR>
rheumatoid arthritis..<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
BUTYRIC ACID ENEMAS -- butyric acid is normally produced in normal colon.<BR>
Inadequate production of butyric acid due to bad eating habbits results in<BR>
masabsorption of essential nutrients, starvation of colon cells, poor healing,<BR>
diarrhea, and colitis. Findings in Germany 10 UC patients who failed to<BR>
respond to conventional therapies, were given enemas containing sodium butyric<BR>
acid enemas for 2 weeks. After treatments, stool frequency went from almost 5<BR>
times a day to only 2x a day, the discharge of blood stopped completely, and<BR>
endoscopic examninations showed reduction in inflamations. <BR>
Similar studies in the US reached the same conclusion, that Butyric acid<BR>
enemas provide an effective, low cost, non-toxic method of treating<BR>
inflamatory dieseases of the colon.<BR>
Butyric acid enemas supply the energy for colon cells to heal themselves. It<BR>
went on to say that when this is followedf with a high fiber diet which<BR>
contains cultured foods that support proper bacterial growth, problems like UC<BR>
can be eliminated.<BR>
<BR>
The only supplier that offers butyric acid is:<BR>
Tyler Encapsulations<BR>
2204-9 NW Birdsdale,<BR>
Gresham, OR 97030<BR>
(503) 661- 5401<BR>
<BR>
They only sellto licensed health -care prectitioners, so your doctor has to<BR>
order for you. The sell a &quot;kit&quot; which includes all the necessary supplies to<BR>
administer th enemas for 2 weeks.<BR>

Do you have a candida problem? <BR>
<BR>
The thing that worries me about juices is that I may be feeding his candida.<BR>
Elaine told me not to worry about candida, that the diet will take care of<BR>
it, but I have a problem letting go of this concern. I know he has a candida<BR>
problem from all the antibiotics he took.<BR>

Thanks, William, for the help, I will re-read page 44.<BR>
<BR>
My son had a bad 2 days, many symptoms came back, like staring at fans,<BR>
fussiness, etc. The GOOD news is it shows this diet is working as there is<BR>
regression if we go off of it.<BR>
<BR>
I also CLEANED out my kitchen so that even the biggest idiot could not mess<BR>
up his diet. Yesterday I threw out the health food cereals that my older<BR>
kids were eating. They like fresh, home made oatmeal anyway and they also<BR>
love brown rice for breakfast. I do still have whole wheat bread in the<BR>
freezer. I need it to make my other kids' lunches. I guess I could buy a<BR>
locked freezer and put it out in the garage??<BR>
<BR>
I am also going to read the next respite worker the riot act and say, give<BR>
him ONLY the foods right here, nothing else! I tried that before and they<BR>
did not get it! still gave him milk and cereal. GEEZ.....!<BR>
<BR>
I am wondering if fruit feeds candida? I would like to give him a half of a<BR>
ripe pear?<BR>

My life-long eczema has been 99% eliminated as soon as I eliminated wheat<BR>
(which I did long prior to trying the SCD diet.) I eat eggs almost daily with<BR>

Dear All,<BR>
It saddens me to raise this issue again, but I do so because someone of<BR>
value has just left our list. This person has been on since the beginning<BR>
(several years ago when Debbie Dowd and I were looking for a way to<BR>
consolidate our daily mail and hit upon the original listserver). He is a<BR>
kind, gentle and giving soul and he's left because he was offended by some<BR>
foul language and continued childish bickering. Its happened before in the<BR>
last several years, but he's had his fill. In my opinion, those of us<BR>
dealing with chronic illness have a shorter fuse than most. Additionally<BR>
this list is composed of people throughout the planet and with a wide<BR>
variety of acceptable behavioral codes. The one thing we have in common is<BR>
our desire to get well through the use of the SCD. Please lets all find a<BR>
way to phrase our thoughts without hostility and to allow others to express<BR>
theirs without fear of reprimand. Common courtesy and respect need to play<BR>
an active role on this list if it is to survive. If anyone takes issue at<BR>
what I've written, please respond in a private email. The last thing we<BR>
need is for this call for peace to turn into WWIII.<BR>

Hello.<BR>
<BR>
For those of you suffering from diarrhea, someone told me about a Japanese<BR>
tea called Morning Tea.<BR>
<BR>
It contains KUZU, BANCHA TEA, and GINGER.<BR>
<BR>
A lady who had cured herself of CD 16 years ago told me about it, and who to<BR>
ask for the recipe. She was on the macrobiotic diet and herbal supplemets,<BR>
and the lady who gave me the recipe for the tea is a macrobiotic specialist<BR>
 (I am still loyal to SCD). She told me that the tea should give me a<BR>
regular BM, and to stop drinking it as soon as the BM is back to normal as<BR>
the body may become depended on it. It should not be drunk for more than one<BR>
month, and the time it takes for it to work differs from person to person.<BR>
<BR>
Has anyone heard of this tea and used it? I made the first batch today. It<BR>
tases OK, but nothing I would drink for pleasing my palete.<BR>
<BR>
Also, while on the topic of strange brews, has anyone heard or used Sweedish<BR>
Bitters?<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>

Jane,<BR>
<BR>
I have not read it yet but it looks to me that the Atkins Diet book has<BR>
worked well for many and seems to be pretty balanced. The problem is<BR>
that the &quot;low-fat&quot; mentality has so permeated the media's and people's<BR>
minds that they think that low fat is the way to go. Carbo's, however,<BR>
are what make us fat and probably are what damage so many peoples GI. <BR>
<BR>
Atkins seems to help dispel this myth, as does THE ZONE and PROTIEN<BR>
POWER. I did not like the zone as I found that it was far too complex<BR>
and caused anxiety just wondering if what you were eating would put you<BR>
in, or out of, the ZONE plus the carbs are grains and such. Protien<BR>
Power seems to be easier to follow and several people I know are getting<BR>
good results with it in terms of weight loss etc. <BR>
<BR>
Concerning fat and cholesterol, I actually have had the opposite<BR>
problem, low cholesterol. Not one doc has ever said one word to me<BR>
about it until just recently, when a doctor said it was THE thing that<BR>
troubled him the most about my blood chemistry. It was 137 and has been<BR>
as low as 121 in the past. Plus, I recently read in 2 different books<BR>
that low cholesterol was not a good thing at all. That there was a high<BR>
incidence of cancer and low cholesterol. <BR>
<BR>
There have been periods over the past 10 years where I have had to have<BR>
monthly blood tests for liver enzymes to be sure that Candida drugs were<BR>
not injuring my liver, so I have lots of data on my cholesterol.<BR>
Interestingly, my symptoms track very closely with the movement of my<BR>
cholesterol. A few years back, I had a very bad flare up of lots of GI<BR>
and assorted symptoms, the first blood test at that time showed me at<BR>
135, the next at 121. I remember feeling very, very badly. Gradually<BR>
over the next 6 months I got feeling, better and better and my<BR>
cholesterol level gradually rose to 168. Coincidence? <BR>
<BR>
I have never been a vegetarian and before onset of the flare I was<BR>
eating a fairly &quot;American&quot; diet, so my cholesterol should have been high<BR>
but instead was very low. Every time, in fact, that I have flared in<BR>
the past 10 years my cholesterol was 137 or lower. <BR>
<BR>
Hal Huggins, in his book, &quot;It's All In Your Head&quot; which is about mercury<BR>
amalgams says that low cholesterol is a marker for mercury poisioning<BR>
since he has found that mercury interferes with the bodies mfg. of<BR>
cholesterol. He says that until the &quot;low fat&quot; cholesterol craze,<BR>
nutritional doctors considered 220-225 cholesterol to be the ideal or<BR>
norm. Cholesterol is a needed and healthy substance in the body and if<BR>
your diet does not provide it, then the body will make more of it. He<BR>
has found that people eating 2-3 eggs per day and upwards of 1/4 pound<BR>
of real butter (thats right 1/4 pound!) always tended to normalize their<BR>
cholesterol right in this range regardless of whether or not they had<BR>
high OR low cholesterol. So much for a low fat diet.<BR>
<BR>
Glad SCD is working for you. I have been on it now 37 days and I have<BR>
never come out of a flare up this quickly, never! SCD and butter for<BR>
me!!<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone else have any data or further info on this subject??<BR>

&gt; Dear Pat,<BR>
&gt; I know exactly what you mean. I,ve never been looking for a diet to<BR>
&gt; solve<BR>
&gt; just one problem, but have been a firm believer in treating the whole<BR>
&gt; body for<BR>
&gt; optimal health and that would solve all the problems that I have since<BR>
&gt; everything is connected anyway. I think this diet is a little strict,<BR>
&gt; as it<BR>
&gt; needs to be, to put the body back to working order. Following that<BR>
&gt; with a<BR>
&gt; low-carbo diet for continued good health. I have a big question<BR>
&gt; though.<BR>
&gt; Tonight for example - went out to dinner with friends. I had to ask<BR>
&gt; certain<BR>
&gt; questions to order my dinner and of course people say - why that, or<BR>
&gt; why did<BR>
&gt; you ask about etc, and don't you eat your rice or potato? They want<BR>
&gt; to know<BR>
&gt; more about low-carbo diets and what books are good and how it effects<BR>
&gt; their<BR>
&gt; HDL, they are so into the low fat thing. For people who do not have<BR>
&gt; intestinal disorders, or think they don't, which one of the low-carbo<BR>
&gt; books<BR>
&gt; best describes a program that can be followed for general good health?<BR>
&gt; I've<BR>
&gt; read the zone, and although there are similarities, I still think it<BR>
&gt; leaves<BR>
&gt; too much room for carbos. I wonder what Elaine would recommend as a<BR>
&gt; general<BR>
&gt; diet for people who are just afraid of heart disease and cancer ?<BR>
&gt; I've been<BR>
&gt; on so many &quot;health diets&quot; (vegetarian, macrobiotics, candida,<BR>
&gt; reversing heart<BR>
&gt; disease etc) my friends just nod when I tell them I have a new diet.<BR>
&gt; By the<BR>
&gt; way, it seems to be working for me. Almost one month and I have much<BR>
&gt; less<BR>
&gt; bloating and many less trips to the bathroom. Sorry I was so<BR>
&gt; lengthy, I<BR>
&gt; guess it was the dry red wine at dinner. Take care, Jane<BR>

Moira,<BR>
<BR>
I have been treated for 10 years, off and on, for what the docs<BR>
described to me as having a &quot;severe&quot; Candida infection. Since I was<BR>
&quot;stuck&quot; in a 10 year cycle of having Candida, and then supposedly being<BR>
&quot;cured&quot;, I was looking for something to &quot;break the vicious cycle&quot; so to<BR>
speak :-)<BR>
<BR>
This Sepetember, when I had yet another major flare up, I found the SCD<BR>
diet. At first, the idea of actually eating a piece of fruit or<BR>
something with honey in it, was shocking to me. I would always get a<BR>
very heavy coating of thrush when I was on the candida diet and on the<BR>
anti-fungal drugs, so I was concerned that I was going to feed the<BR>
beasts! To my suprise and delight, what Elaine says in the book was<BR>
exactly my experience. <BR>
<BR>
Simple sugars like fruit and honey seemed to be absorbed into my system<BR>
rapidly giving me needed energy, with NO symptoms whatsoever. Prior to<BR>
SCD, the complex carbo's allowed on the Candida Diet caused me immense<BR>
problems with alternating major diahrea and constipation , bloating, gas<BR>
etc. When I was on the Candida diet, I did not associate these symptoms<BR>
with complex carbos but rather I blamed the candida. I ALWAYS keep a<BR>
journal of symptoms and what I eat when I am sick, and now, can look<BR>
back in it and the incidence's of major GI symptoms are so obviously<BR>
linked to the carbo's, it pains me that I did not see it then.<BR>
<BR>
On SCD, while in the middle of a flare up (I had had the D for about 16<BR>
days straight when I started SCD), I first tried taking a teaspoon of<BR>
raw honey and mixing it in a glass of water. After drinking it, I<BR>
thoroughly expected increased symptoms, instead nothing! In fact, my D<BR>
gradually abated until about 5 days later it had stopped. Normal bm's<BR>
started in about 2 days and have continued since. I gradually added<BR>
apples and bananas and raisins, all of which are not allowed on the<BR>
candida diet. I had no problems with any. In addition, not only did I<BR>
not get thrush, but the thin coating on my tongue that seems ever<BR>
present went away. The only thing I have problems with on SCD are the<BR>
dry curd cottage cheese, yogurt and the allowed cheeses. These give me<BR>
nausea and bloating. I expect that eventually I will be able to eat<BR>
these as well.<BR>
<BR>
I am telling you this so that you might gain courage to at least try<BR>
what Elaine says. I know I am only one person and that does not make<BR>
for scientific proof, but perhaps you'd be willing to give a try. I<BR>
think that the body that is wanting to heal itself, needs the energy<BR>
found in simple, rapidly absorbed sugar that it can use. It is hard to<BR>
go against things that we have been taught so completely like the<BR>
candida diet, but I truly believe, at least in my own experience, that<BR>
SCD is right and the candida diet is wrong.<BR>
<BR>
Also, you should know that I have read, though can't remember where,<BR>
that there are a number of doctors who do not disallow fruit on their<BR>
version of the candida diet, so even they don't agree.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps!<BR>

&gt; Do you have a candida problem? <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The thing that worries me about juices is that I may be feeding his<BR>
&gt; candida.<BR>
&gt; Elaine told me not to worry about candida, that the diet will take<BR>
&gt; care of<BR>
&gt; it, but I have a problem letting go of this concern. I know he has a<BR>
&gt; candida<BR>
&gt; problem from all the antibiotics he took.<BR>

Hi, Patrick:<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I fully agree with you about butter and fat in general: I'm 5'5&quot;,<BR>
normally about 128#, with a blood pressure of 120/80 (that's like &quot;picture<BR>
perfect&quot; for my &quot;advanced age&quot; of 40-ish), and I have never had a phobia<BR>
about eating fats (except rancid fats like beef tallow or real heavy-fried<BR>
stuff) like butter &amp; cheese. <BR>
<BR>
And after reading Sears' &quot;The Zone&quot; I decided that fat was definitely<BR>
something NOT to avoid, and it never appeared to give me any problems; it<BR>
was the carbo's that seem to really be the culprits, so with all this &quot;No<BR>
Fat / Low Fat&quot; craze (like Frito's &quot;Baked Corn Chips&quot; ... yuk! Like<BR>
cardboard!), I've always felt it was idiotic to fall for that. Sears<BR>
explains really well why this fear of fat is the most stupid trap one can<BR>
fall into, when instead one should be &quot;scared of sugar&quot; and &quot;sad about<BR>
starch&quot; ...<BR>
<BR>
And he explains beautifully (though you may have to put on your thinking<BR>
cap &amp; read the chapters several times to understnad the scientific chain<BR>
reactions) why fatties aren't fat because they EAT fat, they're fat because<BR>
they DON'T eat fat! HOw's THAT for an eye-openener, eh? <BR>
<BR>
He says what makes you fat is actually refined carbo's, and if you've ever<BR>
noticed (espe. in the USA, which seems to be THE land of fatties!) the<BR>
shopping carts of fat folks, well, they're all full of &quot;low fat&quot; &quot;diet&quot;<BR>
crap, but it's all refined carbohydrates, which is exactly the stuff they<BR>
shoudl NOT be eating! <BR>
<BR>
I tell you, the industrial food industry is amazing in its power to shape<BR>
human habits &amp; fill its coffers while not giving a damn about killing<BR>
people: you'd thnk that they'd figure &quot;Well, if we kill our customers,<BR>
where's the sense in that?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But I guess they just say &quot;Oh well, they'll die a nice slow chronic-disease<BR>
death, meanwhile they're spending their bucks on our crap, plus lots more<BR>
on our medical subsidiaries / off-shoots, so what's to lose? Let's sock it<BR>
to 'em!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
One thing that really motivates ME to eat healthy food instead of<BR>
industrial food (besides the fact that healthy fresh food simply tastes<BR>
like food .... delicious) is when I compare what a pound of gummy bears or<BR>
chocolate bar costs (say: U$5 a pound), and what that same money will buy<BR>
me in real food (like: Fuji apples 89 cents/#, head of Romaine lettuce 89<BR>
cents, beautiful NY Strip Loin steak $6/#, etc.) ... it just doesn't make<BR>
sense (AND CENTS!) to pay so much money for (basically) sugar &amp; flour with<BR>
some colour &amp; flavour to disguise it! <BR>
<BR>
Or does it make any sense to you out there?<BR>
<BR>
Just asking (you're heard of rhetorical question?) ... please don't<BR>
inundate me with replies!<BR>
<BR>

Yes, (if by that you mean the herbal tincture made / extracted with alcohol).<BR>
<BR>
I've both a) had variations of it in the form of various German &quot;herbal&quot;<BR>
medicines (they're usually sold in delicatessens here in Canada), and b) my<BR>
aunt made some for me once.<BR>
<BR>
In all cases I must say I had one sip and it felt like my bowel was being<BR>
killed: it was NOT a pleasant experience, presumably because the alcohol<BR>
(it's usually a 30% or so base) is deadly to the colitis, and in no way<BR>
makes up for any possible benefits from the herbs.<BR>
<BR>
It stems from European folk medicine, but let's remember, in those days<BR>
they were all &quot;hewers of wood &amp; drawers of water&quot;, they wre all sturdy<BR>
country people / peasants, and anybody with colitis wasn't around long<BR>
enough to see the next day's rising sun because the rigors of that life<BR>
simply eliminated them (if it even existed then!).<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;971102234532_341431959@mrin42.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hello everyone !<BR>
<BR>
I have a very question someone may be able to shed some information on.<BR>
<BR>
It has been exactly 1 month since I started the SCD diet. So far most of my<BR>
bloating and cramping has gone away almost from the begining. The only flare<BR>
-up I had was a week ago due to allergic reactions to the Asacol (which I am<BR>
no longer taking-- or any other drug for that matter). Those symptoms have<BR>
gone away since I stopped medication. Also my bad arthritis pain seemed to<BR>
have almost gone away.<BR>
<BR>
However, the chronic &quot;D&quot; (diarrhea) has not improved. And I still get those<BR>
dull cramping pains in my lower abdomen that anounce a BM. I don't have BMs<BR>
more than 4-5 times a day (3 or 4 is the norm, give or take ), but it is not<BR>
normal in any shape or form. Sometimes there is some solidity, but before I<BR>
get excited about it, it gets bad again. (This is so embarrassing - talking<BR>
about my BMs over the internet.)<BR>
<BR>
Do any of you know why there is pain before BM? I keep forgetting to ask my<BR>
doctor. The visits are so traumatizing for me that I forget everything the<BR>
minute I step into his examination room (he is a colon / rectal surgeon.<BR>
 Need I say more?).<BR>
<BR>
I would like to ask Elaine myself, but I feel she must be really busy. I had<BR>
her number, but it got shuffled with the tons of info I have on CD and the<BR>
SCD.<BR>
<BR>
Have any of you experienced such long BM improvement?<BR>
<BR>
In case you may ask, my diet consists of chicken (usually breast), and turkey<BR>
(ground breast usually), fish, eggs, cheddar cheese, zucchini, bananas,<BR>
dates, cheese cake when ever I get DCCC, honey to sweeten herbal teas,<BR>
 watered down Welche's red grape juice to help with wash down the bad taste<BR>
of vitamins and psyllium, and occassionally a baked apple.<BR>
<BR>
Am I doing something wrong? I tried eliminating raw veggies and fruits for<BR>
the purpose of getting rid of the diarrhea. I am at a loss.<BR>
<BR>
Any help is much appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>

As a matter of fact, ther are other members in the SF bay area. I live in<BR>
SF, Prateeksha is in San Rafael, and there may be others as well. My son<BR>
matthew(12) was diagnossed with CD earlier this year, so I also am here as<BR>
the parent of a dieter. Anyway I buy baker's cheese in San Francisco at a<BR>
cheese store at 415 Divisadero called The Country Cheese Co. The phone #<BR>
is:621-8130. If your son is allergic to lactose, then this cheese should be<BR>
OK. There is almost none in it. If he is allergic to milk protein or<BR>
something like that, then it might be a different story. I also have a<BR>
local supplier of almond flour if you are interested.<BR>
Good luck,<BR>

Dear Simone,<BR>
Your diet looks fine except for maybe the pysllium. Why are you taking<BR>
that? Is that what things like metemucil is made of? I don't know enough<BR>
about it but except for that, the other foods (are your vitimins additive<BR>
free?) look fine. Maybe try a week without the physlium &amp; see if the D lets<BR>
up. Elaine's phone # is 905-349-3443<BR>

 Hi Mary,<BR>
<BR>
Why don't you actually write down a menu for the day... How about bags<BR>
marked with &quot;breakfast&quot;, &quot;snack&quot;, &quot;lunch&quot;, etc... Make a phone call to<BR>
the worker, talk to them personally so that there is no<BR>
misunderstanding. I was thinking about your situation, and I almost<BR>
wouldn't blame your first worker -- this diet is just too damn weird for<BR>
any normal human being to understand.<BR>
<BR>
Also, do you think that your son may have manipulated him/her? What<BR>
child would not try and get away with something with the babysitter? Of<BR>
course, the worker may have just been an idiot too....<BR>

Hi Moira,<BR>
I believe it depends on whether he is allergic to milk protein (in which<BR>
case, NO), or lactose intolerant (in which case, YES). If you have tried<BR>
the SCD-style yogurt, and he is intolerant/allergic to it, then the chances<BR>
are that he will have the same reaction to the dry curd cottage cheese.<BR>
Also, have you tried to give him &quot;good bacteria&quot; supplements? They make<BR>
some in powders that do not contain milk as a base. Look for one that has<BR>
directions for children.<BR>
And I'm curious if he's ever been on an antifungal? My doctor had me take<BR>
Diflucan for one week, followed by a continuing regimen of non-prescription<BR>
anti-fungals. This helped my candida problem tremendously.<BR>

&gt; &gt;Hello Denise,<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;You're near CA's capital city, Sacramento, aren't you?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;I sent you the paper today. I hope it arrives okay. <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Don't worry about reimbursing me ... it cost me about $2.10 but if you<BR>
&gt; &gt;send cash, I can't spend it here in Europe, and if you send a check, the<BR>
&gt; &gt;bank will charge more than the face value to deposit it. Anyways, it's<BR>
&gt; &gt;not going to put me in the poor house :?)<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;To tell true, I doubt very much that there will be a large demand for<BR>
&gt; &gt;this document. It's very technical so I don't suppose many other people<BR>
&gt; &gt;will want it. Only you, Odd, and Dietmar have asked for it so far but<BR>
&gt; &gt;maybe if there are a couple other requests, could I ask one of you to<BR>
&gt; &gt;copy your paper and mail it please?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 1) As Keith writes, it IS quite technical (ie. you have to really be<BR>
&gt; conversant with medical lingo to get anything out of it ... i.e. if you<BR>
&gt; don't know what &quot;dysbiosis&quot; means right off the batthen don't even bother<BR>
&gt; asking for it, that's your first clue that you won't understand much in it)<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 2) Anyone living in Canada who wants a copy, you can ask me. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 3) I would suppose (speaking for Denise here without having asked her<BR>
&gt; permission) that she'd be OK with sending a coopy to anyone in Yankeeland<BR>
&gt; once she receives her own?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; ... &quot;Ask, and it shall be gotten unto you&quot;, or something like that?<BR>

Hi Simone,<BR>
<BR>
I tried a variant of the recipe you give below. I used kuzu, water, and<BR>
soy sauce. I had been working with a macrobiotics counselor. It didn't<BR>
do a darn thing for me. I tried it for several weeks. BUT, I have heard<BR>
people say that it did help them. I guess I wasn't the lucky one.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, &quot;kuzu&quot; is the starch from a root. Probably not allowed on<BR>
SCD, but if someone wants to give it a whirl, you can find it in a health<BR>
food store with all the macrobiotic fare.<BR>

&gt; Hello.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; For those of you suffering from diarrhea, someone told me about a Japanese<BR>
&gt; tea called Morning Tea.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; It contains KUZU, BANCHA TEA, and GINGER.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; A lady who had cured herself of CD 16 years ago told me about it, and who to<BR>
&gt; ask for the recipe. She was on the macrobiotic diet and herbal supplemets,<BR>
&gt; and the lady who gave me the recipe for the tea is a macrobiotic specialist<BR>
&gt; (I am still loyal to SCD). She told me that the tea should give me a<BR>
&gt; regular BM, and to stop drinking it as soon as the BM is back to normal as<BR>
&gt; the body may become depended on it. It should not be drunk for more than one<BR>
&gt; month, and the time it takes for it to work differs from person to person.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Has anyone heard of this tea and used it? I made the first batch today. It<BR>
&gt; tases OK, but nothing I would drink for pleasing my palete.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, while on the topic of strange brews, has anyone heard or used Sweedish<BR>
&gt; Bitters?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Regards,<BR>
&gt; <BR>

Hi Pat--<BR>
<BR>
I found your remarks about cholesterol very interesting -- I too have always<BR>
had an extremely low cholesterol, generally around 120's. I was hospitalized<BR>
once a couple years ago with my worst-ever Crohn's flare, and my chol at that<BR>
time was in the 90's!<BR>
No doctor ever said a word to me about it. At that time I was a vegetarian,<BR>
and had been for years, so I attributed my results to that. I was also<BR>
extremely anemic (natch!), and both my internist and GI doc gave me hell over<BR>
THAT, and I was finally threatened with TPN if I did not go out and &quot;bite a<BR>
cow!&quot; to quote my internist. Soon after that I began to experiment by dribs<BR>
and drabs with a wheat-free and then finally with a grain-free diet (per a<BR>
naturopathic MD I saw briefly.) Now, on the SCD, eating meat again, eggs<BR>
almost daily, butter, etc, my cholesterol was in the 130's when last checked.<BR>
 Hmmm...interesting...I'll have to follow up with some research on this. Can<BR>
you name the books you mentioned that connect low-chol with cancer?<BR>
<BR>
By the way-- In the recent discussion about Mycobacterium paratuberculosis,<BR>
someone alluded to it as the organism that causes TB. Mycobacterium<BR>
&quot;tuberculosis&quot; is the causative organism for TB...the jury is still out on<BR>
the M. paratuberculosis as a cause of disease in humans. The research is<BR>
sure interesting but I didn't want any of you worrying about getting TB from<BR>
dairy products. Crohn's maybe...but not TB! &lt;g&gt;<BR>

I disagree with you on this. There are many TYPES of sugar as very well<BR>
explained in SCD. Simple sugars found in honey and ripe fruits are<BR>
rapidly absorbed and don't &quot;feed&quot; candida as do complex sugars and<BR>
starches. The sick body needs a source of &quot;glucose&quot; to have the energy<BR>
to heal! Having used both approaches, i.e. Candida Diets avoidance of<BR>
all simple sugars and SCD's use of simple sugars, I have proven, in my<BR>
own experience, that SCD is far, far superior and healthy. I know I am<BR>
just a test of one! Does anyone else have experience in this area.<BR>

I am in Southern California (Orange County) and have found out several<BR>
things<BR>
about the dry curd cottage cheese.<BR>
<BR>
1) Alta Dena is listed as offering a DCC in Elaine's book. I called them<BR>
and they<BR>
 asked if at all possible to let the publisher of the book know that<BR>
they do NOT<BR>
 carry a DCC and would like to stop getting calls on the subject. The<BR>
woman was<BR>
 very nice about it and happened to mention that she wanted to search<BR>
for it on the www<BR>
 so she would have some kind of alternatives to give callers, but she<BR>
hasn't had time<BR>
 to do it. That's what got me on the www and found the SCD Library Home<BR>
Page and<BR>
 this discussion group.<BR>
<BR>
IF ANYONE CAN LET ELAINE KNOW THAT ALTA DENA DOES NOT OFFER DCC, PLEASE DO.<BR>
<BR>
2) The local Whole Foods Market will order the DCC for me from Friendship<BR>
Dairies.<BR>
 Here is a list of Whole Foods Markets in Northern California. Ask the<BR>
cheese department to<BR>
 order it for you.<BR>

<BR>
3) Do you have Hughes stores in your area? Ask the cheese/deli section to<BR>
 order DCC for you. The Hughes here orders it from Friendship Dairies.<BR>
 They call if Farmer's Cheese.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine's book lists Friendship Dairies phone number as (415) 826-7080. You<BR>
might<BR>
be able to get it from them direct if they are local.<BR>
<BR>
Before I learned that the local Hughes and Whole Foods Market would order<BR>
it for<BR>
me I ordered from Seward's in New England. Although it arrived in good<BR>
shape, I will<BR>
try to buy it locally in the future.<BR>
<BR>
P.S. Seward's has carrageenan in it. In BVC on page 58 Elaine says don't<BR>
use carrageenan.<BR>
Should we not use this DCC then?<BR>
<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;345E1DFB.44D8@sta.ericsson.se&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi all.<BR>
<BR>
I know that there's been a lot of messages concerning youghurt<BR>
making the last weeks, but I would like to post this one anyway.<BR>
<BR>
A few months ago, there was a discussion whether you could use<BR>
only commercial youghurt and &quot;bake&quot; it for 24 hours or not.<BR>
I don't know if anyone tried that (at least I haven't seen any<BR>
postings on it), but now I can tell you that, for the last few<BR>
weeks, Iv'e eaten about three gallons of this kind of homemade<BR>
commercial yoghurt with no negative reaction at all.<BR>
<BR>
I remember that a couple of weeks ago, in a discussion about if<BR>
you could use to much commercial yoghurt as starter, someone said<BR>
that commercial yoghurt could contain up to 30 percent lactose.<BR>
I don't know about the U.S. commercial yoghurt, but here in Sweden,<BR>
no commercial yoghurt (except the flavoured ones) contains more<BR>
than seven percent carbohydrates (the flavoured ones around fifteen).<BR>
<BR>
Recently, there was a discussion/comparison on yoghurt preparation<BR>
time. How about this: Two minutes to wash the container, one minute<BR>
to pour in the yoghurt and put it in the oven - a total time of<BR>
three minutes. Try to beat that if you can!<BR>
<BR>

&gt; &gt;Hello everyone !<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;I have a very question someone may be able to shed some information<BR>
&gt; on.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;It has been exactly 1 month since I started the SCD diet. So far<BR>
&gt; most of my<BR>
&gt; &gt;bloating and cramping has gone away almost from the begining. The<BR>
&gt; only flare<BR>
&gt; &gt;-up I had was a week ago due to allergic reactions to the Asacol<BR>
&gt; (which I am<BR>
&gt; &gt;no longer taking-- or any other drug for that matter). Those<BR>
&gt; symptoms have<BR>
&gt; &gt;gone away since I stopped medication. Also my bad arthritis pain<BR>
&gt; seemed to<BR>
&gt; &gt;have almost gone away.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;However, the chronic &quot;D&quot; (diarrhea) has not improved. And I still<BR>
&gt; get those<BR>
&gt; &gt;dull cramping pains in my lower abdomen that anounce a BM. I don't<BR>
&gt; have BMs<BR>
&gt; &gt;more than 4-5 times a day (3 or 4 is the norm, give or take ), but it<BR>
&gt; is not<BR>
&gt; &gt;normal in any shape or form. Sometimes there is some solidity, but<BR>
&gt; before I<BR>
&gt; &gt;get excited about it, it gets bad again. (This is so embarrassing -<BR>
&gt; talking<BR>
&gt; &gt;about my BMs over the internet.)<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Do any of you know why there is pain before BM? I keep forgetting to<BR>
&gt; ask my<BR>
&gt; &gt;doctor. The visits are so traumatizing for me that I forget<BR>
&gt; everything the<BR>
&gt; &gt;minute I step into his examination room (he is a colon / rectal<BR>
&gt; surgeon.<BR>
&gt; &gt; Need I say more?).<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;I would like to ask Elaine myself, but I feel she must be really<BR>
&gt; busy. I had<BR>
&gt; &gt;her number, but it got shuffled with the tons of info I have on CD<BR>
&gt; and the<BR>
&gt; &gt;SCD.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Have any of you experienced such long BM improvement?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;In case you may ask, my diet consists of chicken (usually breast),<BR>
&gt; and turkey<BR>
&gt; &gt;(ground breast usually), fish, eggs, cheddar cheese, zucchini,<BR>
&gt; bananas,<BR>
&gt; &gt;dates, cheese cake when ever I get DCCC, honey to sweeten herbal<BR>
&gt; teas,<BR>
&gt; &gt; watered down Welche's red grape juice to help with wash down the bad<BR>
&gt; taste<BR>
&gt; &gt;of vitamins and psyllium, and occassionally a baked apple.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Am I doing something wrong? I tried eliminating raw veggies and<BR>
&gt; fruits for<BR>
&gt; &gt;the purpose of getting rid of the diarrhea. I am at a loss.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Any help is much appreciated.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Regards,<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Simone<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Dear Simone,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Are we allowed psyllium on this diet? I asked Elaine and she said<BR>
&gt; absolutely<BR>
&gt; not. Could that be the problem?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, don't be afraid to call her. I have called her and she is very<BR>
&gt; nice.<BR>

Besides a doctor who siad this to me recently who has many years<BR>
treating mercury toxic patients, I have read about the dangers of low<BR>
cholesterol in Hal Huggins book, &quot;It's all in your Head&quot; and in Udo<BR>
Erasmus book called, &quot;Fat's that Heal, Fats that Kill.&quot; Both mention<BR>
the dangers of low cholesterol in a &quot;by the way&quot; sort of way so there is<BR>
not a ton of info on this. Both books are very good though. With the<BR>
craze about High Cholesterol, I don't seem to find anything on the other<BR>
side of the coin.<BR>
<BR>
Huggins says for many, many decades 220-225 was considered ideal and<BR>
normative. He also says if he can get people off white sugar and<BR>
refined carbos, and then get them to eat at least 2 eggs per day and up<BR>
to 1/4 pound of butter that whether or not not they are high or low,<BR>
their cholesterol will eventually normalize around 220.<BR>

&gt; is<BR>
&gt; sure interesting but I didn't want any of you worrying about getting<BR>
&gt; TB from<BR>
&gt; dairy products. Crohn's maybe...but not TB! &lt;g&gt;<BR>

When I compose my email it looks great on my computer (Lotus Notes). But<BR>
when I receive the message back from the SCD-list server it looks horrible.<BR>
For instance, I just sent a message to Moira with a list of Whole Foods<BR>
Markets and I had tabbed the stores into columns. When I got the message<BR>
from the server it was all messed up!<BR>
<BR>
What am I doing wrong?<BR>
<BR>
Help!<BR>

Dear Pat and Julie,<BR>
<BR>
Regarding cholesterol, mine was so low awhile back that it was below 100. I<BR>
was congratulated by the nurse and doctor. Very shortly thereafter, I was<BR>
diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.<BR>
<BR>
Someone on another list said that the idea of cholesterol figures were made<BR>
up by the pharmaceutical industry to sell drugs.<BR>

&gt; Hi Mary,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Why don't you actually write down a menu for the day... How about bags<BR>
&gt;marked with &quot;breakfast&quot;, &quot;snack&quot;, &quot;lunch&quot;, etc... Make a phone call to<BR>
&gt;the worker, talk to them personally so that there is no<BR>
&gt;misunderstanding. I was thinking about your situation, and I almost<BR>
&gt;wouldn't blame your first worker -- this diet is just too damn weird for<BR>
&gt;any normal human being to understand.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Also, do you think that your son may have manipulated him/her? What<BR>
&gt;child would not try and get away with something with the babysitter? Of<BR>
&gt;course, the worker may have just been an idiot too....<BR>
&gt;<BR>

Thanks, Bill, for the help.<BR>
<BR>
Last time I had set aside a shelf in my refrigerator, plus complete written<BR>
instructions.<BR>
<BR>
I think the sitter was just trying to be nice, felt sorry for him, and gave<BR>
him the forbidden food. <BR>
<BR>
 It was just a bad mistake but hopefully won't happen again, it really set<BR>
him back, it takes awhile for the food to get out of his system.<BR>
<BR>
You know what I have done is toss out most of the &quot;poison&quot; in this house,<BR>
the processed cereals are gone now, they should have been all along, but my<BR>
older kids liked the raisin bran from the health food store. Now, they will<BR>
eat Old Fashioned oatmeal from scratch! The only possible poison would be<BR>
some whole wheat bread in the freezer, I may have to toss that out just for<BR>
that day, to get peace of mind. This diet is so crucial and a child's brain<BR>
is at stake.<BR>
<BR>
I am also going to cook a huge pot of chicken soup, that will keep him full<BR>
for awhile.<BR>
<BR>
This diet does work, he is again improving. I saw so much regression after<BR>
the diet breakdown, it took him 2 to 3 days to recover. Now, the<BR>
improvements are showing up again.<BR>
<BR>
Again, thanks, Bill, for thinking of me!!! Wish me luck this Thursday!<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Moira, you are an inspiration to us all !<BR>
<BR>
P.S. Remember that oats are not allowed on the SCD either.<BR>
