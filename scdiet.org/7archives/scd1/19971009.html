I suspect many of you lost your customary quick snacks when you went on <BR>
this diet, as I did.<BR>
<BR>
What do you do instead?<BR>
<BR>
I eat baby carrots, using almond (or other nut) butter as a dip, which <BR>
is crunchy, satisfying, and caloric (which I want.)<BR>
<BR>
Also sliced apples with cheese.<BR>
<BR>
Also I mix almonds, raisins, dates in a bowl to keep around.<BR>
<BR>
What other EASY snacks do folks eat?<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
p.s. does anyone else use a VITAMIX to make stuff? I'd love to swap <BR>
recipes.<BR>

The first time I tried this diet I followed the introductory diet that<BR>
Elaine outlines in the book.  I found is so unappealing that I barely ate<BR>
and was just exhausted.  I could only take a few days of this before I gave up.<BR>
After some encouragement from this group I decided to start the diet again,<BR>
but this time without doing the start up diet.  I did make a few<BR>
modifications, however, because I was experiencing diarrhea at the time.  I<BR>
tried not to eat any cooked vegetables, I peeled all my fruit and I waited a<BR>
few months until I introduced nuts and beans.  I did introduce baking with<BR>
nut flour fairly quickly though.<BR>
Maybe because of this I prolonged my diarrhea, but I just couldn't eat at<BR>
all any other way.  I was just too tempted to cheat while on the start up<BR>
diet, and I think that it's more important to avoid the forbidden foods than<BR>
it is to avoid introducing foods too soon.<BR>

I think you CAN use too much starter.  I don't know if Mik has posted it on<BR>
his web page, but Elaine mentioned something about this in a letter not too<BR>
long ago.  Apparently, in commercial yogurt they add extra milk solids which<BR>
bumps up the lactose content from the 10% found in milk to about 30%.<BR>
When the bacteria break down the lactose, one of the by products is lactic<BR>
acid.  Lactic acid will lower the pH of the yogurt.  Because there is so<BR>
much lactose to break down the yogurt will get to a pH level that<BR>
inactivates the bacteria before all the lactose is broken down.<BR>
If you are just using plain milk, the lactose will all be broken down before<BR>
the pH level of the yogurt gets so low that the bacteria no longer function<BR>
properly.<BR>
I tried cutting back a bit of the yogurt at a time to see how low I can go.<BR>
I now use barely 1/4 cup for each litre of yogurt that I make, I have yet to<BR>
try going any lower.  My yogurt turns out fine every time.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

<BR>
I started experimenting with dried fruit (I buy mine at whole foods) which is<BR>
prepared without additives or sugar.  The dried blueberries and currants are<BR>
especially wonderful in muffins.  The dried fruit adds flavor and nutrition<BR>
to the batter without adding more liquid to it.  In fact, it actually soaks<BR>
up some of the excess wetness we tend to end up with.  <BR>
<BR>
Blueberry Lemon Muffins<BR>
<BR>
3 eggs<BR>
1/2 cup honey<BR>
1 tsp vanilla<BR>
1/8 tsp salt<BR>
2 1/2 c. almond flour<BR>
3/4 c. dried blueberries<BR>
1 T. grated lemon rind (fresh)<BR>
1 tsp baking soda<BR>
<BR>
Mix eggs with the honey.  Add the vanilla and salt.  Mix well.  Gradually add<BR>
the almond flour.  Mix well.  Blend in the blueberries and lemon rind.<BR>
 Finally add the baking soda*.  Fill muffin cups about 1/2 full.  Bake at 350<BR>
for about 20 minutes.  Makes 1 dozen muffins.  About 220 calories, 15g<BR>
carbohydrate, and 75 mg calcium in each muffin.<BR>
<BR>
I add the baking soda last because it begins to react immediately when mixed<BR>
with wet ingredients.  It's rising power is a timed reaction.  (Baking powder<BR>
rises twice--first it reacts with wet ingredients and then it has a rising<BR>
reaction to heat.  We don't have the advantage of two reactions when using<BR>
only baking soda.)<BR>

Dear Liz,<BR>
This question has come up before. I accidently started making my yogurt<BR>
with 1/2 the amount called for in the book, but my yogurt comes out perfect<BR>
every time so I've stuck with it. I'm sure there's no harm in using the<BR>
amount called for in the book, but I guess I just don't want to mess with<BR>
what I've found to be a winning formula.<BR>

Hi Joan,<BR>
<BR>
Pecan flour (actually, the company I ordered it from - Dutch Valley Foods<BR>
in Myerstown, Pa....listed in the book, on page 143) is called &quot;pecan meal&quot;<BR>
by the company when you call to place a order.  It costs 10 lbs. - $11.39<BR>
($1.14 lb.); 30 lbs. - $30.00 ($1.00 lb.) and this is considerably cheaper<BR>
than almond flour.  I live on the west coast, USA, and the shipping charges<BR>
were $20.00!!!!<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, almond flour I ordered from Hughson Nut Company in<BR>
Hughson, California, I paid $3.25/lb. - $81.25 for 25 lbs. (min. order)<BR>
plus $5.50 shipping.<BR>
<BR>
I have not baked anything yet just with the pecan flour, but I ordered 30<BR>
lbs. (mistake) because I prefer the consistency of the almond flour to the<BR>
pecan meal which is not as finely ground and also takes up more space in<BR>
the freezer.  I am using it to add to the mixture when I need more bulk and<BR>
less liquid; as well as sprinkling ontop of yogurt!  I'll try it in the<BR>
muffins soon and see how it comes out.<BR>
<BR>
Now, regarding the 36 hour fermentation of yogurt as opposed to 24 hours,<BR>
this is what our friend, Rachel, does so I just followed what she is doing!<BR>
But, we're both making it in the oven and it takes awhile for the oven to<BR>
reach between 100-110 degrees F. just using the oven light for heating the<BR>
yogurt in the covered pan.  Just last week, I started making a gallon<BR>
instead of 3 quarts because it seems time to make it again comes around too<BR>
soon!  Worked just fine.<BR>
<BR>
Letting it ferment for 36 hours as opposed to 24 insures that the lactose<BR>
is totoally out and since I don't tolerate most dairy products very well, I<BR>
decided to go for the extra 12 hours and have had no problem digesting the<BR>
36-hour yogurt.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Hi Prateeksha -<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;on the pecan flour - is this more expensive or less than almond flour? i dont<BR>
&gt;recall it mentioned in elaines book but guess it must be. also, on the 36<BR>
&gt;hour fermentation - what does 12 more hours accomplish? i am new at this.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;thanx -<BR>

Dear Jeff, I make my yogurt like Rachel does; however, just for<BR>
clarification, since you're a &quot;rookie&quot;, I am inserting a couple of<BR>
notations which might help you.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Dear Jeff,<BR>
&gt;The following is how I make my yogurt. It may seem cumbersome at first, but<BR>
&gt;after 2 &amp; 1/2 years it has become 2nd nature and I think I could make it in<BR>
&gt;my sleep.<BR>
&gt;Yogurt<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;3 quarts of 1/2 &amp; 1/2<BR>
&gt;1 &amp; 1/2 cups plain store bought yogurt (1/2 cup to each quart of 1/2 &amp; 1/2)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Bring 1/2 &amp; 1/2 to simmer (small bubbles around edge)<BR>
&gt;Take off burner and let cool to complete room temperature, cool better than<BR>
&gt;even slightly warm. You can refrigerate to help cool. If you don't<BR>
&gt;refrigerate, it takes at least 6 hours to get the right temp.<BR>
<BR>
Unless you keep the yogurt in the pot it came to a boil in and place the<BR>
pot into a plastic dish container (I use my kitchen sink plastic container<BR>
that I wash dishes in) that has cold water in it.  Careful, that you don't<BR>
have so much water in the container that when you place the yogurt pot in<BR>
it goes over the top of the pan!  And I place the lid of the pot behind the<BR>
pot and start gently running cold water into the plastic container and this<BR>
induces the water to keep getting cooler and cooler, otherwise the water<BR>
gets quite warm from the hot pot and you have to keep changing it a lot.  I<BR>
know this &quot;wastes&quot; water, but it takes me about 20 minutes before the<BR>
yogurt is absolutely at room temperature.<BR>
<BR>
I then in another bowl, place the yogurt and add 1 cup at a time of that<BR>
cooled milk into the yogurt, whisking briskly (I make a gallon); according<BR>
to the book, you should use 1/4 cup yogurt to 1/2 milk (page 132, 3.) for<BR>
each quart of milk you have boiled and cooled.  Then slowly pour that<BR>
&quot;paste&quot; mixture into the cooled, boiled milk all the while whisking briskly<BR>
until it is thoroughly mixed together.<BR>
<BR>
  I very carefully take the lid out of the water, making sure not to drip<BR>
any of the water into the milk and dry it and put it back onto the pan and<BR>
dry the pan and into the oven it goes.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Then in a seperate bowl, place plain yogurt and slowly add 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (I use<BR>
&gt;wisk). When this solution is thin, add back slowly (wisking) in pot of 1/2<BR>
&gt;&amp; 1/2.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Place pot (covered) into oven with a 60 watt light bulb on. Keep<BR>
&gt;thermometer in oven and maintain 100 to 110 degrees. If oven becomes warm,<BR>
&gt;use a pen to prop open the door just a bit. Once you've done it a few times<BR>
&gt;you'll get a feel for how your oven best maintains this temperature.<BR>
&gt;Good Luck,<BR>
&gt;Rachel<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope I haven't confused you with all this detail!<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,<BR>
<BR>

&gt; This question goes out to the women on the list (no offense meant to<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; guys),<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Well, actually I might be able to give some input here.  According to<BR>
some spirit guide person I knew in Boulder, she said that my colitis was<BR>
a carryover from my last life, as a woman.  If you stretch your mind a<BR>
little (ok, a lot), all this bleeding down in my intestinal area is just<BR>
a manifestation of my &quot;woman's problems&quot; in my previous life.  She also<BR>
suggested that there was a very serious wound -- a knife wound.  There<BR>
is a big-ass hole in my spirit body in my lower abdomen area.<BR>
<BR>
I guess I can't shed any light on your problem, I don't have any<BR>
conscience recollections of my past life.  If I'm going to help I need<BR>
to do a past life regression -- maybe some hypnotysm.  Isn't all this<BR>
stuff fastinating? More fastinating is the fact that people believe and<BR>
rely on it to make important decisions.  I do admit though, that I have<BR>
no trouble with having past lives, I'm just not convinced that past life<BR>
regressions actually tap into their memories.  But hey, unless you drop<BR>
thousands of dollars on it, it certainly is harmless enough.<BR>
<BR>
My women friends who confided with me on this subject, were either on a<BR>
diet from hell (I'd say bordering on or anorexic) or athletes (swimmers<BR>
mostly) in extreme training.  The doctors involved said that it is<BR>
probably a case of insufficient calories, and to just eat more.  In the<BR>
case of the SCD, I'm not sure.<BR>

Good point!  The commercial yogurt I use for a starter states in it's list<BR>

I totally believe in remembering past lives during past life regression.  Dr.<BR>
Brian Weiss, a psychiatrist in Miami wrote 3 books on the topic of past lives<BR>
which he stumble upon accidently (as written in his first book, &quot;Many Lives<BR>
Many Masters&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
In his second book,  &quot;Through Time into Healing&quot;, he has documentation about<BR>
patients of his who had cured themselves of incurable things such as asthma,<BR>
obesity, chronic unexplainable pain, etc.. which were  carry-over  symptoms<BR>
from previous lives; usually having to do with how they had died.  Once these<BR>
patients remembered these lives and came to accept what had happened to them<BR>
then, their symptoms &quot;magically&quot; dissapeared never to return.<BR>
<BR>
I personally never experienced this, but I have regressed several<BR>
non-believers to experience some of their past lives.  His second book<BR>
provides a script with which anyone who has read enough about this can<BR>
regress anyone including themselves on an audio tape.  Now if only this can<BR>
work for some of us and cure us of this IBD we carry around...  WOW!<BR>
<BR>
You too, or anyone interested can try this at home even for the price of the<BR>
book and a tape with relaxing background music.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck!<BR>

Tell them right away.  If a guy can't work with your eating habits<BR>
and health, then any prolonged committment won't work either.<BR>
When I was dating my husband (who has CD/UC), this discussion<BR>
was one of the early ones.  Yeah, it was a little scary for me,<BR>
especially when he told me his dad had CD and his twin sister<BR>
had UC (both had surgery and are well today), but God knew <BR>
what He was doing when he put the two of us together.  I love to<BR>
cook and my husband loves to eat!<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;What I am still wrestling with is how to deal with this on a first date with<BR>
&gt;someone.  I'm assuming that if I order plain grilled salmon with steamed<BR>
&gt;vegetables and decline bread and dessert, they will just think that I'm<BR>
&gt;either on a weight loss diet or a healthy heart diet and won't find it too<BR>
&gt;unusual.  (I'll just skip the part where I usually tell the waiter they can<BR>
&gt;put butter on my food, just nothing else!)  I tend to be very open and matter<BR>
&gt;of fact about my illness.  I guess I've been forced to be because for the<BR>
&gt;last 2.5 years it's been pretty obvious that something was wrong with me.<BR>
&gt; I've been dating people whom I already knew during the time I was so ill, so<BR>
&gt;I never had to explain to someone in a dating context.  Now it's no longer<BR>
&gt;obvious that I'm ill.  Telling them too soon seems inappropriate and waiting<BR>
&gt;too long to tell them seems inappropriate too.  Has anyone developed some<BR>
&gt;personal rules of thumb on this?  (My approach--telling people I'm on haitus<BR>
&gt;from dating--isn't a long term solution! ;-)<BR>

Hi Renee,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; This question goes out to the women on the list (no offense meant to the guys),<BR>
<BR>
I'd like to answer this even though I am a guy.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Have any of you missed your periods during your first 6 months or so on <BR>
&gt; the diet? I've missed mine for two months now. ....<BR>
<BR>
IMHO, I believe this would occur because your body is shutting down what it<BR>
perceives to be non-essential functions during the healing process.  How<BR>
many people on the list (guys included) noticed that their sex drive went<BR>
down along with their energy when they first started the SCD diet ?<BR>
<BR>
When your body feels better, all parts start working better again.  Think<BR>
of all those Star Trek episodes where they lower life-support systems to<BR>
get more power to the shields and warp engines.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Body, Heal Thyself&quot; --- with some help from the SCD diet.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks...Dan.<BR>

&gt;I started experimenting with dried fruit (I buy mine at whole foods) which<BR>
is<BR>
&gt;prepared without additives or sugar.  The dried blueberries and currants<BR>
are<BR>
&gt;especially wonderful in muffins.  The dried fruit adds flavor and nutrition<BR>
&gt;to the batter without adding more liquid to it.  In fact, it actually soaks<BR>
&gt;up some of the excess wetness we tend to end up with.<BR>

&gt; I joined this list a few days ago -- what a find! (Can I get a digest<BR>

 <BR>
I found this old posting describing what digest is from Bill Roman ....<BR>
<BR>
&gt; For those of you not familiar with the DIGEST option, it allows a member to<BR>
&gt; receive a periodic (daily) summary digests of messages posted to the list.<BR>
&gt; If you select the DIGEST option, then once a day, you receive a single<BR>

<BR>
I only use digest mode for all lists I follow, and this works well.  Often<BR>
these lists are long because too many people reply to a message including<BR>
*all* of the original message (unnecessarily IMHO).  I print the SCD digest<BR>
daily for my wife to read.  So to cut down on wasted paper/ink, I forward<BR>
the message back to myself after editing out the unwanted stuff, and then<BR>
print the new message.<BR>

Why do you make life more difficult for yourself than it need be?  I also<BR>
have blueberries in my freezer, which I eat with yoghurt in the morning.<BR>
Have you ever considered simply putting them in the dish as soon as you<BR>
arise from bed, then doing your morning pre-breakfast washing &amp; dressing<BR>
... by the time you get back to them (maybe 10 minutes) they'll be thawed<BR>
out just right (not too mushy, not too frozen), then put your dollops of<BR>
yoghurt on top, and voila, it's ready.  <BR>
<BR>
Nof uss, no muss, no hassles worrying about hot water, and extra hassles,<BR>
and diluting the nutrients by putting the fruit in water, and hot water at<BR>
that!<BR>
<BR>
And if those 10 minutes aren't enough, just put them into the bowl before<BR>
you go to bed &amp; place in fridge (not freezer) ... by morning they'll be<BR>
perfect!<BR>
<BR>
You've heard of KISS ... &quot;Keep it simple, s*&quot;???<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

I hate to disagree with ya, Dan, but I must strongly state that in my<BR>
experience, you're wrong!  Even when I've been ill, and low energy, even<BR>
when I've been as low as 88# (I'm 5'5&quot;), I still had a libido.  Not as<BR>
strong, and not as much &quot;oomph&quot;, but definitely there.  Only when on strong<BR>
post-op pain-killers like morphine / demarol did things simply refuse to<BR>
&quot;rise to the occasion&quot; &amp; somehow got disconnected, no matter how hard (no<BR>
pun intended) I tried.<BR>
<BR>
The other reason why I believe this observation (that sex drive is the last<BR>
thing to wane) is valid is: look at all the breeders in the 3rd world,<BR>
they're mostly starving to death, yet they manage to breed like crazy,<BR>
outdoing any of us in the &quot;civilized&quot; world!  The body's got to be really,<BR>
really down for the count before it gives up the xxx ghost, I've concluded.<BR>
<BR>
My conclusion is that the reason why people believe that libido evaporates<BR>
with illness is (a) much of sex is in the head, and when you're ill many<BR>
folks also let their head-trips go to shit, so to speak, and/or (b) when<BR>
you're ill (at least if you're a 1st-worlder) you usually get amply dosed<BR>
with medications, and THEY, not the illness itslef, depress the libido in<BR>
many cases.<BR>
<BR>
Whadda ya say?<BR>

Dear Yogurtmet Users:<BR>
<BR>
i need some help. i just received my yogurt maker. it says it makes yogurt in<BR>
4 hours? everyone is talking about 24-36 fermentation process. please advise.<BR>
<BR>
also, Rachel says to use store bought yogurt (i use brown cow) for the<BR>
starter. i dont know how much to use because the company sells their own<BR>
starter.<BR>
<BR>
i thought a starter WAS the friendly bacteria cultures but the book is<BR>
differentiating between starter and probiotic cultures. can you give me some<BR>
input so i can get started?<BR>
<BR>
thanx -<BR>

As Elaine suggested the longer the better, as our daughter was confirmed <BR>
as having a lactose intolerance, we typically leave it for 48 hrs, but <BR>
24 - 36 generally should suffice.<BR>

the<BR>
&gt; Crohn's and Colitis Foundation.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
<BR>
I have had a couple negative Crohn's and Colitis Foundation experiences<BR>
this year. First, our local group wanted to have a naturopath come speak<BR>
about the SCD. When main &quot;headquarters&quot; wasn't able to force a cancellation<BR>
of the event, our leader was told not to use the CCFA logo on the<BR>
newsletter that month. <BR>
<BR>
A few months later I went to a Crohn's and Colitis event in Vancouver B.C.<BR>
(with about 1000 people in attendance). During the course of the evening<BR>
the doctors WARNED us several times to stay away from  <BR>
FAD diets, saying that you don't need the extra stress of a restrictive<BR>
diet.   <BR>
<BR>
Later during the Q&amp;A period I asked them what they thought about the SCD.<BR>
They said that there was no science behind it, and that the way they do <BR>
things in medicine is with double-blind studies. They weren't interested in<BR>
hearing anything positive about it.<BR>
<BR>
It really saddens me that the gastroenterology specialists put so much<BR>
effort into trying to keep a lid on information about the diet. I don't<BR>
expect them to blindly recommend it, but I do think that once they know<BR>
that people are responding to the diet, they should offer the information<BR>
to their patients, whether or not there have been double-blind studies.<BR>

<BR>
I think that HMO's who are always interested in cutting costs/saving<BR>

&gt; Hi Simone,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; I had not idea Synthroid has lactose in it.  I am taking that too (.75mg)<BR>
&gt; &gt; along with 2400mg of Asacol a day.  So, you recommend to take lactase tablets<BR>
&gt; &gt; when taking these medications?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Yes, even though Elaine Gottschall says not to take anything with lactose in it<BR>
&gt; (even with lactase supplements) and to find a different medication made without<BR>
&gt; it.  There is no substitute for synthroid that doesn't have lactose,<BR>
&gt; unfortunately.  You aren't taking a very large does (I actually take a whopping 3<BR>
&gt; mg -- yes, 3000 mcg -- since I have a genetic defect which prevents my body from<BR>
&gt; using thyroid hormone properly) so probably wouldn't need much lactase to go with<BR>
&gt; it.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; And if you followed the Gottschall diet (from *Breaking the Vicious Cycle* by<BR>
&gt; Elaine Gottschall), which is the SCD diet, and added some vitamin supplements to<BR>
&gt; it (I found I needed more than was recommended in the book) you could probably<BR>
&gt; get off the Asacol.  I would guess (from the size of the pill) that the Asacol<BR>
&gt; has a large amount of lactose as filler.  It really is criminal to put lactose in<BR>
&gt; a medication actually made for people with gut problems!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Good luck!<BR>
&gt; <BR>

Message-ID: &lt;199710101459.JAA16479@b01d04.exu.ericsson.se&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Last night the Dallas CCFA chapter hosted an IBD Family forum.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Daniel Present from Mt. Sinai in NY was the keynote speaker.<BR>
<BR>
Before he spoke, there was a panel consisting of a nutritionist,<BR>
a GI and a colo-rectal surgeon who gave short presentations and<BR>
answered questions.<BR>
<BR>
I knew all 3 of the panelists.  The nutritionist is affiliated<BR>
with the medical school here, and has Crohn's herself.  I met<BR>
with her about 2 months ago at the recommendation of my doctor.<BR>
I figured if she has Crohn's, maybe she's got some good insight.<BR>
When I saw her two months ago, I went with my &quot;Breaking the Vicious<BR>
Cycle&quot; book and asked her if she's ever heard of it.  She said <BR>
she hadn't.  I was disappointed, but was encouraged when she <BR>
wanted the ISBN number from it, saying she wanted to take a look<BR>
at it.<BR>
<BR>
Well, at the forum last night, she mentioned the book specifically<BR>
by name, BUT.. as just another one of those &quot;elimination diets&quot;<BR>
that she couldn't endorse.  She hadn't been able to locate the<BR>
book at any bookstore (I told her she'd probably have to order<BR>
it!), so she hadn't read it.  But she described it as a &quot;wheat-<BR>
free&quot; diet that worked for some woman's daughter who then went<BR>
out and wrote a book about it.  I couldn't believe it!  I was<BR>
livid.<BR>
<BR>
People in the audience had a chance to ask questions on cards<BR>
which were submitted to the moderator who then read the questions<BR>
from the podium.  On my card I tried to clarify what the diet<BR>
really was, what Elaine's background was, and how many people<BR>
report success on the diet.  I also mentioned that it could be<BR>
ordered through any local bookstore and that there's an on-line<BR>
support group.<BR>
<BR>
When the moderator got to my question, all he said was, you can<BR>
order the book through a bookstore.  He didn't mention anything<BR>
else I'd written on the card.  Again, I was angry.<BR>
<BR>
At the break, I caught up with the nutritionist and tried to clarify<BR>
things.  She kind of looked like she wanted to run away, but she did<BR>
take the web address for the SCD home page.  She also told me she's<BR>
wary of specialized diets because she knows people who went in remission <BR>
just drinking Ensure.  I never could catch up with the moderator to ask<BR>
him why he didn't read everything on my card.<BR>
<BR>
When Dr. Present got on stage to talk, I must admit, I was very <BR>
impressed with his presentation and his committment to IBD.  However,<BR>
when he talked about diet, he said there was a study done on patients<BR>
following a &quot;low-residue&quot; diet and a &quot;normal diet&quot; and no differences<BR>
were found.  Of course, the &quot;low-residue&quot; diet includes sugar, grains,<BR>
and starches.  So he apparently wasn't a big fan of diet modification<BR>
either.  It seems if there's not a double-blind study done, doctors<BR>
don't listen.  He talked alot about the new drugs in the pipeline<BR>
(e.g. anti-TNF) and was really pushing the immuno-modulators (e.g. 6MP).<BR>
He strongly discouraged the use of steroids in the treatment of IBD<BR>
and predicted that within 5 years, less that 10% of IBD patients will<BR>
be given steroids.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, an informative evening, but one quite discouraging with<BR>
regards to the SCD.  Maybe the nutritionist will log on to the web<BR>
page and learn a few things.  By the way, she no longer has a colon<BR>
and has been on immuno-suppressants for 11 years.  I'd rather skip<BR>
the pasta, thank you.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for letting me vent.<BR>

Ask them to quote the double blind studies done on surgical procedures. If they can't then<BR>
I assume that they never refer patients to surgery due to the lack of double blind studies.<BR>
<BR>
Double blind studies are good when possible, but they don't apply in many areas such as<BR>
surgery or diet. It just isn't possible to design a double blind experiment in those cases.<BR>

I know its a generalisation but doesn't the medical commuity stink at =<BR>
times?<BR>
<BR>
On a non-SCD related issue, I just discovered that whilst Doctors in the =<BR>
UK push us all to pump our 2 year olds with the MMR vaccine (you should =<BR>
have seen the looks we got when we said no), it turns out that over 50% =<BR>
of the doctors don't give their kids the vaccine.  Does that tell you =<BR>
something about the reasons behind giving the vaccine or what!?<BR>
<BR>
I think its a question of keeping pushing the message to the medical =<BR>
community.  In the UK where the National Health Service (NHS) is =<BR>
tax-payer funded, I'm trying to make the point with my specialist that's =<BR>
it's got to be saving the NHS money if I see a dietician once in a while =<BR>
to supervise the diet, rather than get them to spend money on drugs and =<BR>
UC specialits all the time. Hey, maybe they could give me the save money =<BR>
to spend on almond flour!!<BR>

It is sad that doctors, whose purpose is to heal people, avoid therapies and<BR>
techniques that are not in agreement with what they learned in medical<BR>
school.  It's almost as though they're too egotistical to accept that they<BR>
may be wrong all this time.  Not to mention the business aspect of keeping<BR>
people sick and relying on their services and the chemicals from<BR>
pharmaceutical companies.<BR>
For example, in the 1930's, a man named Royal Rife discovered the cure of<BR>
some cancers and hundreds of other illnesses including herpes, turbeculosis,<BR>
flu...After he successfully CURED 16 out of the 16 terminally ill patients<BR>
with cancer in 3-6 weeks using his bioactive frequency machine (which is<BR>
totally harmless and creates no side-effects), the pharmaceutical cartel set<BR>
out to burry him. They burned down his laboratory and confiscated anything<BR>
they could not destroy. They even resorted to poisoning  his partner before a<BR>
symposium where he was to reveal the research, and making physical threats to<BR>
anyone supporting Rife.  What is one man to do against such an army?  He was<BR>
a scientist, not a politician or a lawyer.  Needless to say his work was<BR>
&quot;erased&quot; from the face of the earth and those who knew him and the success of<BR>
his work were bribed into denial.  Fortunately, some of his followers<BR>
salvaged enough of his work to continue this amazing research in Mexico where<BR>
the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies can not touch them.  Today, one can<BR>
buy the Rife machine as an&quot;experimental tool only&quot;, because the FDA will<BR>
never approve a machine that can cure something for pennies a day that can<BR>
bust a multi-billion dollar empire.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunatelly, there are doctors out there, like my own, who recognize that<BR>
they don't know everyting.  My doctor has allowed me to use any method I wish<BR>
if I feel  would make me  better.  He even supports my starting the SCD diet.<BR>
He only insisted I take Asacol; the rest he trusted I know what I am doing.<BR>
He even knows about the Rife machine and was interested enough to read the<BR>
book and other information I had on it.  Unfortunatelly Crohn's has not been<BR>
researched, although some  doctors feel that Crohn's is similar to<BR>
Tuberculosis at a bacterial level, and to try those frequencies along with<BR>
frequencies that destroy parasites and Candida A.  I am definatelly starting<BR>
on that too.<BR>
<BR>
There has to be other dedicated doctors who don't have a God complex and<BR>
don't treat their patients like they  can't think for themselves and their<BR>
ideas are half-baked.  I thank God for my doctor, for he has done more for me<BR>
than he is entitled to as a physician.  Anyone living in Miami, FL area<BR>
should have him on their side.<BR>
    Thanks for reading this.<BR>

Dear Liz,<BR>
How frustrating! There are none so blind as those who will not see. Well,<BR>
all we can do is continue to TRY to pass the word. I even have people in my<BR>
life close to me, who have IBD, who have seen my health go from poor to<BR>
great, and who tell me that the diet just looks like too much trouble.<BR>
Whatcha gonna do?<BR>

SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; .. I later heard my doctor was instrumental in banning any mention of<BR>
&gt; the SCD and Elaine Gottschall from the Crohn's and Colitis<BR>
&gt; Foundation...<BR>
<BR>
BANNING ANY MENTION OF THE SCD, AND ELAINE GOTSCHALL? And by the very<BR>
institution that is supposed to be a cutting edge source of ideas and<BR>
technologies to help and cure us! <BR>
<BR>
&lt;snip&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I think that HMO's who are always interested in cutting costs/saving<BR>
money, may be a source of ideas or help in this battle.  It would be<BR>
nice to start a separate listserver (I will inquire as to how to<BR>
accomplish this - I may not have the ability) to discuss ways (not vent<BR>
and rave) to get this diet into the mainstream.<BR>
<BR>
I just feel a bit like an ingracious idiot for not making any efforts to<BR>
counteract this atrocious mindset.<BR>
<BR>
But Michael, you ARE making an effort....in a more effective area, <BR>
using the SCD to assist you in regaining your health back. By every <BR>
post you (and other members) send that tells me of another <BR>
success you have had on the diet, I am supported to keep plugging <BR>
along with the diet.  And the more successful I am, the more my <BR>
family and friends notice and want to learn about what I have done to <BR>
become healthier.(even people without IBD can benefit from better <BR>
digestion habits). Now, Michael, that's myself you have supported, <BR>
multiplied by my family and friends, multiplied by the # of others <BR>
supported on this list, times their family and friends.  This does <BR>
not make you an ingracious idiot.<BR>
<BR>
It is in my opinion that people will only listen when THEY want to <BR>
know something, not when we push it on them. (cause I was one of <BR>
*THEM* once)<BR>
<BR>
Also the HUGE issue of what's really going on in the <BR>
medical/pharmaceutical proffession is intangible. And people have a <BR>
hard time grasping something that can't be seen/proved.  <BR>
<BR>
We can see an improvement in a persons health, though.  I think the <BR>
best way to mainstream the diet is to show others our results and let <BR>
them decide for themselves.<BR>
<BR>
&lt;clink&gt;&lt;clink&gt; Just my two cents worth :-)<BR>

Hi, Geoff:<BR>
<BR>
Just going through my backlog of e-mail (600plus of them!  I was away fro 2<BR>
months).  Noticed your un-subscribe request ... curious: have you found<BR>
some other method that works better than the SCD diet?  Or ???<BR>
<BR>
	Any feedback would be much appreciated.  Sincerely, <BR>

Dear people,<BR>
<BR>
Do any of you live in England and faithfully follow the SCD?  I visited in<BR>
London last spring and was unable to find dry curd cottage cheese.  Possibly,<BR>
the difficulty was one of what to call it, but DCCC, &quot;pot cheese,&quot; and<BR>
&quot;farmer's cheese&quot; all came up empty; nor could I discover anything like it<BR>
while browsing in several markets.<BR>
<BR>
If this cheese exists in England, what is it called and where does one find<BR>
it?<BR>
<BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;&gt; .. I later heard my doctor was instrumental in banning any mention of<BR>
&gt;&gt; the SCD and Elaine Gottschall from the Crohn's and Colitis<BR>
&gt;&gt; Foundation...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear Bar:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In respone to your well-written post re Matthew's despair about the<BR>
CCFA/CCFC not being &quot;on board&quot; with the SCD ....<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;BANNING ANY MENTION OF THE SCD, AND ELAINE GOTSCHALL? And by the very<BR>
&gt;institution that is supposed to be a cutting edge source of ideas and<BR>
&gt;technologies to help and cure us! <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I think that HMO's who are always interested in cutting costs/saving<BR>
&gt;money, may be a source of ideas or help in this battle.  It would be<BR>
&gt;nice to start a separate listserver (I will inquire as to how to<BR>
&gt;accomplish this - I may not have the ability) to discuss ways (not vent<BR>
&gt;and rave) to get this diet into the mainstream.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I thought you were going to say &quot;Ways to convince the powers-that-be, i.e.<BR>
MediCare &amp; HMO's, that it's to their advantage to fund research, and esp.<BR>
clinical research, into (for example) SCD and other dietary ideas vis IBD.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I just feel a bit like an ingracious idiot for not making any efforts to<BR>
&gt;counteract this atrocious mindset.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;But Michael, you ARE making an effort....in a more effective area, <BR>
&gt;using the SCD to assist you in regaining your health back. By every <BR>
&gt;post you (and other members) send that tells me of another <BR>
&gt;success you have had on the diet, I am supported to keep plugging <BR>
&gt;along with the diet.  And the more successful I am, the more my <BR>
&gt;family and friends notice and want to learn about what I have done to <BR>
&gt;become healthier.(even people without IBD can benefit from better <BR>
&gt;digestion habits). Now, Michael, that's myself you have supported, <BR>
&gt;multiplied by my family and friends, multiplied by the # of others <BR>
&gt;supported on this list, times their family and friends.  This does <BR>
&gt;not make you an ingracious idiot.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Exactly!  People keep despairing because they're &quot;not being accepted by the<BR>
Establishment&quot; (in this case, by the Medical-Industrial Complex, as I call<BR>
it), but that's missing the point: insurrection and evolution don't always,<BR>
well, actually, SELDOM, really set root through &quot;convincing the<BR>
Establishment&quot;'; change happens by the &quot;little people&quot; doing their &quot;little<BR>
stuff&quot; and slowly things are suddenly &quot;different&quot;.  Plus one can never be<BR>
aware of the impact even a word or gesture given to someone at some time<BR>
(that you dont' even remember!) may or may not have!  You know, how a<BR>
husband will say one thing, and the wife will &quot;hear&quot; something else, and<BR>
it'll fester for decades ... and inthe end, if they ever discover it, it<BR>
turns out to be a total mis-understanding (that's what gret novels &amp; films<BR>
are made of!).<BR>
<BR>
Just by &quot;doing what we do&quot; and &quot;keepin' on truckin'&quot;, we're  having an<BR>
impact.  It's sort of like &quot;It's better to light a single cnadle than to<BR>
curse the darkness&quot;.  Every action taken is a choice made ... by<BR>
participating in SCD, even if you just read the e-mails or have Elaine's<BR>
book and try-a-little-bit, you've made a decision to travel a differnt path<BR>
than if you didn't do those things.  And every action has its &quot;ripple<BR>
effects&quot;, even though, we who are riding the waves of our individual lives,<BR>
can't always discern what effect those ripples have on the landscape<BR>
trailing behind us!<BR>
<BR>
Gist of it: just go for it, live a life, and don't give a shit about<BR>
despairing that &quot;I'm not changing anything&quot; ... you ARE!  Even if it's only<BR>
yourself.<BR>
<BR>
(Is there a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; script in here somewhere???  Would Jerry say these<BR>
things?  Or Kramer, in his own inimitable style?)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It is in my opinion that people will only listen when THEY want to <BR>
&gt;know something, not when we push it on them. <BR>
<BR>
Right on!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;(cause I was one of <BR>
&gt;*THEM* once)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Ditto!  You know the saying &quot;Takes 1 to know 1&quot;, eh?   ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Also the HUGE issue of what's really going on in the <BR>
&gt;medical/pharmaceutical proffession is intangible. And people have a <BR>
&gt;hard time grasping something that can't be seen/proved.  <BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Right again.  The vagaries of human interactions (e.g. pharma rep, some of<BR>
whom are seductive ex-nurses, or speak of &quot;conferences in the Bahamas to<BR>
tell you aboaut this new drug&quot;  &amp; MD's) ... who can ever put that on a<BR>
platter in a court of law &amp; weigh it out clearly?<BR>
<BR>
The big decisons at the top are not made by direct words &amp; writings, it's<BR>
all &quot;who you know&quot; and &quot;how you say it&quot; (wink, wink, nod, nod ... ever<BR>
tried to convict someone for a vague, undefinable gesture???).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;We can see an improvement in a persons health, though.  I think the <BR>
&gt;best way to mainstream the diet is to show others our results and let <BR>
&gt;them decide for themselves.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
To paraphrase Barb: forget &quot;mainstreaming&quot;, if someone has a need, they'll<BR>
go looking, and if they go looking, sometimes they get lucky &amp; find.  Those<BR>
who either don't look, or are unlucky enough not to find, well, who ever<BR>
said life was either fair or perfect?  Just get over it, and get on with it!<BR>

do<BR>
&gt; so? And if so, where might I find the article.<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;971011080714_2089302042@emout08.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hello Everyone.  I'm new to this diet, and this web sight.  I must say it is<BR>
a relief to have a place to go when I feel really sorry for myself!  In other<BR>
words, it's nice to know I'm not alone.  <BR>
<BR>
I started the diet 10 days ago, while in the midst of the worse flare up I've<BR>
had yet (UC/one and one-half years).  I know my doctor is going to suggest<BR>
another scope when I go back in two weeks, and I was hoping to have positive<BR>
news for her by then so as to avoid this action.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, my question is when does the bleeding stop?  Currently, I'm only<BR>
eating fish and very overcooked vegetables.  (I've been a vegetarian for six<BR>
years, but have recently incorporated fish into my diet, and last night I<BR>
even &quot;stooped&quot; to grill a piece of chicken, simply for variety.)  I started<BR>
with nut flour, only for two days, but thought it wise to discontinue it<BR>
after reading several posts about the products being hard to digest when you<BR>
first start the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
I may be expecting too much too soon, but would appreciate any input on this<BR>
subject.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks.  Deanna<BR>

<BR>
All,<BR>
<BR>
The subject of the SCD and the medical establishment and CCFA is of great importance.  <BR>
We have a significant grass roots movement now that needs to grow even stronger.<BR>
<BR>
I remember when Elaine came to Fort Wayne, I called in advance to the leader of the <BR>
support group for cystic fibrosis.  I wanted her group to know about the Elaine's talk <BR>
and they could come to one of the presentations if they chose to.  The lady told me that <BR>
she would have to check with the doctors to determine if they would allow the group to <BR>
hear about this information.  I think you can guess the result.  This practice is fairly <BR>
common.  It is a form of censorship but I do not think they realize that censorship is <BR>
taking place.  I think they believe they are protecting their group.<BR>
<BR>
In the long run, I think we need an organization which has a mission to perpetuate the <BR>
SCD.  That would include making information available, be a clearing house for <BR>
questions/answers and take a proactive role in promoting the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
The CCFA is, in my mind, in the fund raising business.  They are well organized and do a <BR>
good job of raising funds.  If bowel diseases were ever cured, I suspect the CCFA would <BR>
change its name and mission and continue to raise funds for another cause.  This has <BR>
happened in the past - remember polio.<BR>
<BR>
The medical profession, similarly is in the medicine and operation business.  The <BR>
doctors are well trained and they are good at it.  Unfortunately, the best answers are <BR>
not always medicines and operations.  Keep in mind that doctors have been trained for <BR>
many years in school.  They have been thoroughly immersed in the medication/operation <BR>
methods.  To them, anything that deviates from that training is suspect at best.<BR>
<BR>
We will not turn the corner on this overnight.  We are dealing with one of the most <BR>
powerful establishments in the world.<BR>

Dear Deanna,<BR>
Results vary from person to person. I hope your bleeding stops soon. I was<BR>
one of the lucky ones. I was not in a really bad place with my disease when<BR>
I started the diet 2 &amp; 1/2 years ago (although I was still bleeding), but<BR>
all my symptoms totally abated within a few months of beginning the diet.<BR>
Initially, my bleeding became sporadic, before it completely stopped. I'd<BR>
bleed for only a day or two at a time instead of continuously. The first to<BR>
go was the bloating and pain. I lost weight, but even before that happened,<BR>
I noticed that my face LOOKED healthier. The gray palor and bloat left it<BR>
first. My body stopped feeling as though there were an engine constantly<BR>
running sluggishly ( on overdrive), working insanely hard to digest<BR>
anything I put in it. This is something I've meant to ask the group, if<BR>
anyone else experienced this when their disease was active. In any case, I<BR>
wish you lots of good luck and health.<BR>

If I ever show up at one off these events, it certainly isn't to try to<BR>
convince the doctors or the CCFA salaried people of anything. All it takes<BR>
is one look at the animosity in their faces to figure that one out. I look<BR>
at it as an opportunity to bring up the diet and hope that a few new people<BR>
get the needed information. <BR>

I don't know how to use this listserv as I just signed on a few days ago.<BR>
 I've never done anything like this on the computer before but I have been<BR>
reading everything on this SCD site like crazy.  I stumbled across it when I<BR>
was on a celiac site and found it immediately interesting because the celiac<BR>
diet was not helping me  (I couldn't even handle rice).  None of their<BR>
alternative grains worked for me.  I called to order the book and actually<BR>
got Elaine on the phone. She was very helpful and I should get my book this<BR>
week.  From reading the information off the SCD site I've been following the<BR>
diet as closely as I can figure out.  It has already helped!  I do have one<BR>
beginning question though - I hate yoghurt!  What to do? I have cramps if I<BR>
drink a fruit smoothie with yoghurt from the health food store.  I've also<BR>
been told I have candida. I was discouraged when one of your writers<BR>
suggested that someone might have to go off the SCD diet and work on the<BR>
candida problem first, although I heard in the book Elaine says the SCD diet<BR>
works well for those with candida.  I think this forum is a good one and I<BR>
hope I can participate.  Thank-you for listening!   Jane<BR>

Dear Jane,<BR>
The book says to use homemade yogurt (I too hated yogurt when i started. I<BR>
love it now) &amp; gives you the recipe. I think you'll find it easier to<BR>
digest. The diet should also take care of your candida problem.<BR>

of 1996.  I have been reading letters from the Web site since about<BR>
January 1997.  I have tried to stay on the diet with some success.but<BR>
I have to admit that chocolate is my biggest downfall.  Just yesterday<BR>
I <BR>
had this bad abd cramping that lasted for over 5 hours and I wanted to <BR>
curl up and die.  In my panic I called my doctor who has increased my<BR>
prednisone to 40mg/day and put me on 6-MP and flagyl.  What do you<BR>
think.  I am wondering why so much prednisone. Well I guess this is <BR>
more than enough information for my hello message.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Does the SCD diet allow plantains?  They're from the banana family, I just<BR>
haven't seen it mentioned anywhere.  Also, how about almond milk (without<BR>
forbidden sweetner or homemade kind using honey). And date sugar for<BR>
cooking/baking?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Simone<BR>

	Dear Jane,<BR>
                     I have been on the diet for one year . I do not and<BR>
never have eaten yogurt. It tears up my colon. I also had a candida problem<BR>
before the diet. That is much more in check now. Maybe I will try yogurt in<BR>
the future but I am in no rush. It is possible to do the diet minus the<BR>
yogurt. My colon is in great shape 99% of the time the only time it reminds<BR>
me of it's past state is if I slip and cheat.<BR>
                                                       Take Care,<BR>
                                                                     Kay<BR>

<BR>
Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I was looking through all my cookbooks in attempt to find some other recipes<BR>
for a variation in cooking/baking.  I found some in the FIT FOR LIFE<BR>
cookbook, and would like to share them with you.  I would like some feedback<BR>
if they are forbidden in the diet.  I think they would be delicious, although<BR>
I haven't yet personally made them yet.<BR>
<BR>
FRUINOLA<BR>
<BR>
2 large apples, peeled and coreed              1/4C coarsly ground almonds<BR>
1 Tbs currants                                            2 tsp sweetner (<BR>
the book says maple syrup.  Maybe honey instead?)<BR>
1/4 C shredded coconut (opt)                     1/2 tsp ground cinnamon<BR>
1/4 C diced dried figs                                 1/4 c fresh apple<BR>
juice (or cider according to SCD)   <BR>
<BR>
1. Place the apples and currants in food processor and coarsely grind.<BR>
2. Mix the apple mixture with the rest of the ingredients.  Mix well.<BR>
  (serves 2)<BR>
<BR>
CHEWY BREAKFAST PUDDING<BR>
<BR>
2 large dates             <BR>
1 apple, peeled, and cut into quarters<BR>
1 large frozen banana<BR>
3 large dates, diced into chewy bits<BR>
<BR>
1. Place the first 4 ingredients in blender and puree into thick pudding.<BR>
2. Pour mixture into bowl and stir in dates.  Eat with spoon.   (serves 2 -3)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
STANDARD FRUIT PIE CRUST<BR>
<BR>
1/3 C sunflower seeds                    1/3 C dried, unsweetend shredded<BR>
coconut<BR>
1/2 C sesame seeds                       1/2 to 1 C raisins (enough to make<BR>
to mixture gooey)<BR>
1/3 C almonds or pecans                 1 C soft pitted dates<BR>
<BR>
1. Grind the seeds, nuts, and coconut to a fine meal in a food processor.<BR>
 Add fruit and process, adding additional raisins, as necessary until the<BR>
mixture forms into a ball.<BR>
2. Press mixture into a 9-in. pie plate.  The crust will be nearly 1/4-in.<BR>
thick.  Refrigerate a couple of hours before using.<BR>
<BR>
Note:  You can substitute any combination of seeds and nuts to equal<BR>
quantities in recipe<BR>
           If mixture does not ball up, add a few Tbs. apple juice, of water.<BR>
Variation:  For a delicious high-energy treat, roll this mixture into<BR>
walnut-size balls or logs, roll in coconut, and freeze.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PEACHES AND CREAM PIE<BR>
<BR>
1 standard fruit pie crust (above)                           1/2 C water<BR>
5-6 large peaches, peeled                                      1 tsp. vanilla<BR>
extract<BR>
3 Tbs fresh orange juice                                        1/3 C<BR>
sunflower oil<BR>
1/2 C raw cashew pieces<BR>
3 Tbs sweetner (book asks for maple syrup)    <BR>
<BR>
1. Prepare the crust and set in refrigerator or freezer.<BR>
2. Sclice peaces in half moons.  In a mixing bowl, combine the peaches with<BR>
the OJ and set aside.<BR>
3. Place cashews in blender with sweetner, water, and vanilla.  blend until<BR>
creamy and smooth.  While tha blender is on LOW, add oil in a thin stream<BR>
through the opening lid until the mixture thickens but is slightly runny.<BR>
4. Coat bottom of crust with a thin layer of the cashew mixture.  Add layer<BR>
of peach slices in flower petal fashion, spread the cashew mix again and<BR>
continue so until you end with a top layer of peaches.<BR>
5. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.  (...if you can wait that<BR>
long)       (serves 8)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Is anyone out there trying the SCD diet with their child who is diagnosed<BR>
with autism? I am a new subscriber and am trying this diet, we have been<BR>
going gluten free and casein free and seen lots of improvement, are hoping<BR>
to see more with the exclusion also of rice and potatoes.<BR>

I have a strange request.  I have a friend with CD. She is in really bad<BR>
shape!!! And she doesn't have a computer CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!!  i have been on<BR>
the diet for about three weeks (i've posted before-i usually wine about<BR>
having to give up pasta and sweets) but anyway....   i sent her the book, but<BR>
she doesn't have the constant support we do!!<BR>
<BR>
my request is this:  if it's not to much trouble, could some of you  write to<BR>
her and tell of your experiences on the diet, she could really use it.<BR>
<BR>
