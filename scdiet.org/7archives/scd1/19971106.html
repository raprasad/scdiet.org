&gt;Thanks Dietmar!  I read Sears book actually (a while ago) but was fustrated<BR>
&gt;trying to follow the diet and was having trouble with grains so I forgot<BR>
&gt;about what I read.  Jane<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I read it (3x, actually, to get a real handle on the scientific<BR>
explanations he gives about e.g. the insulin-glucagon system) more for his<BR>
explanations about the variouis hormone cascades / pathways; that area of<BR>
his writing was MOST relevant to me, rather than his diet (although the<BR>
gist of his diet is pretty simple to explain: &quot;eat more good fats, eat less<BR>
refined carbo's, eat adequate protein, and don't beat yourself up for not<BR>
following the 'diet fad of the month'&quot;)<BR>

&gt;You have mentioned the book &quot;The Zone&quot; several times. It sounds very<BR>
&gt;interesting so when I was at the health food store last night I looked for<BR>
&gt;it in their book section. The have 2 different books by Barry Sears; 1-<BR>
&gt;&quot;Enter The Zone&quot;, copyright 1995; and &quot;Mastering The Zone copyright 1997.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Each was marked as $25.00 USD. Which one should I get or both? - <BR>
<BR>
I don't know.  The book I read was simply called &quot;The Zone&quot;, neither<BR>
entering nor mastering it ... I guess he &quot;diversified his assets&quot; after<BR>
putting out his first book?<BR>
<BR>
Why not call someone who works with nutrition (nutritionist at a hospital?<BR>
local naturopath?  health food book store owner?) and ask them which they<BR>
think should be read first or which you don't need to bother reading?<BR>
Maybe the second one has more recipes or something (I think I read<BR>
something to that effect on his website, but don't quote me on it, it's<BR>
been 5 months since I looked at it ... I was trying to ask him a question<BR>
about bufallo meat, but he never replied, probably overhwelmed by e-mails &amp;<BR>
a question that's &quot;too far out&quot;!).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Which<BR>
&gt;should I read first? And do you think I could find them less expensive?<BR>
<BR>
As any bookstore; it's a best-seller, they're usually published as<BR>
hardcovers first, then, when that demand abates, they switch to putting out<BR>
paperback versions; or maybe there's a used-book store you could check with.<BR>
<BR>
(How old are you, just out of curiosity?)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;They were hardbound versions.<BR>
&gt;<BR>

my wife and i are on the zone diet for 1.5 years now, i have both books, i would<BR>
read the &quot;Enter The Zone&quot; to find out why sears thinks the diet works, and if i actually<BR>
went on the diet i would buy the &quot;Mastering The Zone&quot; because there are some important<BR>
tips in the latter that would have saved us some suffering during the first six months,<BR>
also the latter book has some dietary adjustments on the portion sizes and minimum quantity<BR>
of food for small women that came for the HMO study in san antonio texas, he also outlines<BR>
three phases of commitment to the diet, and i know people who simply who follow the zone<BR>
by not eating starches or sugars and they lose weight and their blood pressure falls to<BR>
youthful levels, it is very hard to eat too much in the way of veggies. you can<BR>
also get an intro to the diet at http://www.enterthezone.com/whatis<BR>

Subject: TREATMENT OF ACTIVE CROHN'S DISEASE WITH HEPARIN<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;9711060057.AA19645@swansong.amd.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
TITLE: [65] TREATMENT OF ACTIVE CROHN'S DISEASE WITH HEPARIN<BR>
<BR>
AUTHORS: J.L. Dupas, F. Brazier, T. Yzet, B. Roussel, J.C. Duchmann, F. Iglicki, Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital, Amiens, France<BR>
<BR>
BODY: It has been suggested that microvascular thrombosis related to<BR>
vasculitis and procoagulant factors activation may contribute to the<BR>
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Anticoagulant and antiinflammatory<BR>
properties of heparin may be useful in the treatment of active inflammatory<BR>
bowel diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential<BR>
efficacy of heparin in the treatment of active CD. Methods: 13 patients (9<BR>
F, 4 M; age 16-31 yr) with active CD (Crohn's disease activity index, CDAI<BR>
&gt; 200) were included in the open-label study. Disease activity was<BR>
clinically and endoscopically assessed before treatment. Disease extended<BR>
only to the colon in 3 patients and to the colon and terminal ileum in the<BR>
10 other patients. Eight patients had chronic active CD treated by<BR>
azathioprine and/or prednisolone for at least 3 months; drug doses were not<BR>
altered in the 3 weeks period before and were continued at the dose used at<BR>
entry, throughout the 4-weeks study period. Patients were administered<BR>
heparin, either intravenously (IV) 3000u/4hrs for 1 week and subcutaneously<BR>
(SC) (calcium heparinate) 0.1 ml/10kg b.i.d. for the following 3 weeks<BR>
(n=7), or SC 0.1 ml/10kg b.i.d. for 4 weeks (n=6). Concomitant treatment<BR>
with other drugs was not allowed during the study. All patients were<BR>
clinically and biologically evaluated every week for the 4-weeks treatment<BR>
period and followed up every 2 weeks for 2 months after the end of heparin<BR>
treatment. Results: After 4-weeks treatment, 7/13 patients (54 %) fulfill<BR>
the remission criteria (CDAI &lt; 150) and 3 other patients reported<BR>
significant clinical improvement ([Delta-bar] CDAI&gt;100); 3 patients failed<BR>
to respond. The mean CDAI decreased from 315 (95%CI:260-369) before<BR>
treatment to 165 (95%CI:107-222) at the end of heparin treatment (p&lt;0.004).<BR>
The mean C-reactive protein decreased from 80.5 mg/l (95%CI:45-115) before<BR>
treatment to 35 mg/l (95%CI:18-52) (p&lt;0.007) after 1-week treatment. Slight<BR>
increase of rectal bleeding due to overdosage of heparin was observed in 2<BR>
patients leading to discontinuation of treatment in one of them. Among<BR>
responders, 6 patients were still in remission 3 months after the end of<BR>
treatment and 1 patient had a relapse at week 6. Conclusions: These results<BR>
suggest that heparin treatment may be effective in patients with active CD.<BR>

After about three weeks, my husband had to get off the diet, due to<BR>
bleeding, weakness and weight loss.  I thought he was doing better, but<BR>
he didn't, and he's the one who knows. I felt terrible seeing him so<BR>
weak, because this was my idea and he went along with it.  He was eating<BR>
eggs - maybe that's why it didn't work.  <BR>
<BR>
I was encouraged reading this list and I'm disappointed because I believe<BR>
it could work.  Elaine's book was the first thing I ever read on UC that<BR>
made sense.<BR>
I don't know what's next - been through four years of  drugs, and he's<BR>
still in pain, rarely goes out because of the diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to those still persevering - it's not easy.<BR>

&gt;Hi Steve,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Who's the local supplier of almond flour, in the Bay Area?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
Hi Prateeksha,<BR>
<BR>
I've been buying almond flour from a company in SF called California Nut<BR>
Trading Company. I Don't have an address for them, but their phone is 415<BR>
243 0320. the man's name is Motzi Dorudian(I'm not at all sure of the<BR>
spelling of that first name by the way). I have gone by and picked it up,<BR>
but they ship most of their business (they're wholesalers). I believe I<BR>
paid about eighty-five dollars for twenty-five pounds. One thing you should<BR>
know however, and that is that although the first box was great, the last<BR>
one was from a different source, and there were moths in the bag. I keep<BR>
meaning to call the guy and tell him about it, but I never get around to<BR>
it.<BR>
<BR>
On another note, I noticed that you get baker's cheese at Country Cheese<BR>
Co. After reading what Barb had to say about DCCC and baker's cheese, I<BR>
feel like I ought to talk to Mario and find out where he gets it. It's from<BR>
a local cheesery unless I'm mistaken. I'd like to talk to someone there and<BR>
see if they can tell me anything about the lactose content. It's sure a lot<BR>
easier to bake with than curds would be, and it doesn't taste at all like<BR>
ricotta. It's quite tart. still I would hate to be responsible for steering<BR>
people in the wrong direction<BR>

Thanks everyone for the nice words. Matt is indeed a talented and well<BR>

right out of the box. I felt kind of strange posting his writing,<BR>
especially behind his back, but I'm glad that it was appreciated by a a few<BR>
of you. He really has no idea how bad this thing could be, but he knows<BR>
that we don't turn the family boat around and start paddling upstream for<BR>
no reason. In other words, he knows that we have been scared good and<BR>
frankly, he doesn't even want to know the details. Our hope is that he<BR>
never will have to, at least not first hand.<BR>

Thanks again,<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;2.2.16.19971106054954.2b2f0752@megamed.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I think the SCD diet is great and is helping me get rid of &quot;bad&quot; bacteria in<BR>
my son's colon/intestines.<BR>
<BR>
My question is about antifungals. Most antifungals that I have seen tend to<BR>
have starch in them.<BR>
<BR>
Can you take an antifungal on the SCD diet?  Or will the SCD diet naturally<BR>
&quot;starve&quot; out the yeast? I think right now it is happening, the starving of<BR>
the yeast, as my son asks continually for rice bread or some other carbo,<BR>
it's like the yeast in his body are screaming for it. Do they eventually die<BR>
off from lack of sugar and starch??<BR>
<BR>
Also, antifungals concern me as there is a die off, whereas the diet MAY<BR>
slowly kill off the yeast.<BR>
<BR>
Thoughts, anyone? <BR>
<BR>
I was thinking of supplementing with a small amount of grapefruit seed, then<BR>
saw it had starch in it...<BR>

fyi<BR>
<BR>
(SCD is similar to zone diet)<BR>
<BR>
zone dieters who experience weakness ,usually after a couple of weeks after starting,<BR>
are told to supplement with about 90mg of potassium daily as low carb diets have a <BR>
strong diurectic effect, (thats why the blood pressure falls so quickly) this effect <BR>
leaves you feeling washed out. cramps in the legs etc ... are common as well, we use<BR>
nu-salt (potassium) instead of table salt.<BR>

There is a long list of herbal anti-fungals that have no starch.  I'm<BR>
sure there is even grape seed extract without it.   As far as<BR>
prescription anti-fungals, I wouldn't ever touch the stuff -- most have<BR>

You are right about worrying about die-off.  The last herbal I took, the<BR>
die off was pretty intense, but since it was killing stuff, I welcomed<BR>
it.  I guage my doseage on the reactions that I have, so I would think<BR>
that it would be difficult for you to determine it for your child.<BR>
<BR>
As long as you are see improvement, maybe the best policy would be<BR>
sticking to the diet -- it will, IMO, work to kill bad bacteria over<BR>
time.  If the improvement stops, or symptoms get worse, you might see a<BR>
alternative health practioner to advise you on the use of anti-fungals<BR>
-- most of us probably only have experience with adults, and there is<BR>
definitely a physical and emotional difference between the two.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortuneately, this diet isn't quite a miracle -- for most, it takes<BR>
some hard work and some physical disconfort to get results.  As most<BR>
would agree, the discomfort is worth it -- and isn't that bad.<BR>

Hi, I'd be careful with grapefruit seed extract.  Taking that is what<BR>
got me into my current intense 3.5 month flareup.  And I don't think<BR>
it was the starch.  I'd been tolerating starches fine for a year prior<BR>
to taking this supplement.  If you're going to use it, start with a<BR>
very small amount.  You can get grapefruit seed extract in a liquid<BR>
form (without starch).<BR>
<BR>
Good luck/Liz<BR>

Maybe the reason the 13% alcohol content wines are always bone dry is<BR>
because the sugar content would rarely start any higher than 26%? <BR>
How about the difference between semi-dry and dry? Would you say that<BR>
there might be a little residual sugar left in the semi-dry? <BR>

&gt;Having grown wine grapes commercially since the early 70's, I felt <BR>
&gt;compelled to correct your<BR>
&gt;misconceptions of &quot;dry&quot; vs. alcohol.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The term dry for wine refers to its residual sugar content. A sweet <BR>
&gt;wine still has sugar in <BR>
&gt;it while a dry wine has none. We care about the sugar obviously. The <BR>
&gt;alcohol content is<BR>
&gt;really a different thing and a dry wine could have low or high <BR>
&gt;alcohol.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Wine is made by fermenting ripe grapes. One of the criteria for <BR>
&gt;deciding when to harvest<BR>
&gt;the grapes is the sugar content of the grapes. The fermentation <BR>
&gt;process turns the sugar into <BR>
&gt;alcohol at the rate of 2 to 1. So, if you harvest grapes at 24% sugar <BR>
&gt;and ferment it dry, then<BR>
&gt;you will end up with 12% alcohol wine. If you fermented it to 10% <BR>
&gt;alcohol and then stopped<BR>
&gt;it, you would have used 20% sugar and thus the finished wine would <BR>
&gt;have 4% residual sugar.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So in that respect, you might say that the 12% alcohol wine had less <BR>
&gt;sugar than the 10% wine,<BR>
&gt;but that is only if both wines started with 24% sugar grapes. The 10% <BR>
&gt;wine could just as easily<BR>
&gt;have started with 20% sugar grapes and be dry, or the 12% alcohol wine <BR>
&gt;could have started with<BR>
&gt;26% sugar grapes and still be sweet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You can't know anything other than the description of dry, semi-dry, <BR>
&gt;etc. unless you have a<BR>
&gt;sugar test kit. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Since grape juice is OK, I wonder how much harm the residual sugar in <BR>
&gt;wine would cause.<BR>
&gt;If the grapes are low sugar at harvest time,  sugar can be added <BR>
&gt;during fermentation. <BR>
&gt;In that case, any residual sugar could be part sucrose. So I suppose <BR>
&gt;that only drinking wine<BR>
&gt;with no residual sugar would be the best way to know for sure. <BR>

My opinion is that since the grape juice itself is more or less OK, then from<BR>
a sugar standpoint, any dry wine will be much better and probably no problem.<BR>
So just pick a wine that you enjoy. With the small residual sugar in dry wine,<BR>
the alcohol might likely be as much or more of a problem since it can be irritating.<BR>
<BR>
I drink very little wine due to my Crohn's, but when I do I choose the best wine<BR>
available to me at the time so as to maximize the reward/risk ratio. &lt;g&gt;<BR>
<BR>
If you are drinking wine for the enjoyment, then pick a dry wine that you really<BR>
like. If not, then maybe choose something else to avoid the possible irritation of <BR>
the alcohol.<BR>

Yes, the sugar content of grapes tends to max out around 26%. Here in Oregon,<BR>
our Pinot Noir rarely makes it to 24% with 20 to 22 about average. This year we<BR>
barely got to 20%. <BR>
<BR>
But since sugar could be added, you can't know for sure. Our 20% grapes could <BR>
be made into a dry wine with 10% or more alcohol, depending on if sugar is added.<BR>
<BR>
I don't know if there is any official scale of what dry, very dry, semi dry, etc. mean.<BR>
Around 25 years ago when I lived in Toronto, the provincial liquor stores where you<BR>
bought wine had an organized scheme of labeling wines, but I don't remember if that <BR>
included the actual sugar % vs. description. Perhaps someone from Ontario could comment<BR>
if that method is still in existence and if it includes actual sugar levels.<BR>
<BR>
I suspect that in most cases, semi-dry is whatever the winemaker decides. A little<BR>
residual sugar can be useful in masking other characteristics of the wine such as acid<BR>
or alcohol.  If they actually say semi-dry then there obviously would be some sugar.<BR>
<BR>
As I stated in my message to Jane, small amounts of sugar in wine are probably no big <BR>
deal and quite likely the alcohol could be a bigger issue than splitting hairs over dry<BR>
vs. very dry. The amount of sugar in a glass of orange juice is huge compared to the <BR>
amount in a glass of wine. <BR>

Different brands of natural antifungals have no starch in them.  Many<BR>
brands of Capryllic acid don't.  I have used Mycopryl from T.E Neesby,<BR>

Capryllic acid is considered by many to be fairly effective.  Different<BR>
brands of Grapefruit Seed extract have no starch in them.  Caps Plus (I<BR>
am pretty sure has none) or citricidal drops that you mix with water,<BR>
both from Nutricidal are very good also available from Vitamin shoppe.<BR>
I have been reading about Olive Leaf extract and this could well be the<BR>
best to use of all since it is a documented anti-fungal, anti-viral and<BR>
anti-bacterial.(Actually, grapefruit seed extract has similar properties<BR>
but I ahve not read as much documented stuff about it)  I am considering<BR>
trying Olive Leaf myself perhaps, though it seems SCD is doing a<BR>

anti-fungal.  I do use Kyolic Liquid Garlic and have always found it to<BR>

My GI doctor attended a conference last spring where several speakers said that<BR>
Cipro is useful in some cases of Crohn's that don't respond well to other treatments.<BR>
I tried it and seemed to get a little better for awhile but my ileum was too badly damaged<BR>
and I finally had the disease portion removed in September.<BR>
<BR>
There is a chance that something bad is growing in the gut that would be killed by the<BR>
Cipro. Certainly there are various organisms that even if they aren't the cause of IBD,<BR>
certainly aren't doing a diseased gut any favors. <BR>
<BR>
Elaine has mentioned some doctor that uses a procedure where antibiotics are used to<BR>
kill off everything in the gut, and then reintroduces a special strain of organism. Some<BR>

Well, as I said, since my husband and I collect old books I definitely know<BR>
where the used book stores are in the area and have, on many occasions, had<BR>
not just a few doing book searches for us (as well as Internet Book Search<BR>
facilities).<BR>
<BR>
But since I was in the health food store, I thought about The Zone and<BR>
looked.  Furthermore, since the SCD discussion group is usually most<BR>
helpful I thought I would ask about which book references had been made to.<BR>
You had neither of the ones I mentioned.<BR>
<BR>
You probably read Ted's response about &quot;Enter&quot; and &quot;Mastering&quot; (The Zone).<BR>
He shed light on the differences in the two books, which was just the<BR>
information I needed.<BR>
<BR>
As to cost, I inquired out of curiosity, as I am always checking prices to<BR>
see if local stores (especially health food stores) are competitive. For<BR>
instance, I did the same comparisons between stores and web sites before I<BR>
purchased my yogurt maker.<BR>

No I'm not on that list. I do not have a severe case of LBS. I take note of<BR>
how my eating habits affect it and 'try' to adjust accordingly.  The SCD<BR>
has been great. I think because the diet is so strict, and you have to get<BR>
on a good regimen the LBS gets 'treated' at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
Even though I get tired at times and just want to take the easy route, like<BR>
go out for a pizza, I truly think this diet is making me stronger day by<BR>
day. It has really been a life style change for me, and my husband, since<BR>

&quot;The reason that grape juice is ok, but wine made with grape juice may not<BR>

old child and constantly relives those 3 years before they found the<BR>
wonderful Dr. Sidney Hass. &quot;It was hell on earth trying to keep her in one<BR>
piece!&quot;. She adds &quot;I am not nice, I am indignant!&quot;<BR>

I guess that this is the major difference between doing something because<BR>

Hi, SCD gang!<BR>
<BR>
As you may have observed, I'm a medical massage therapist (a profession<BR>
which doesn't exist in too many areas of the world, so you may not know of<BR>
it, but it does exist here in British Columbia, Canada).<BR>
<BR>
So of course I'm interested in touch-related topics.<BR>
<BR>
This past week Dr. Michael Meany of McGill University &amp; the Douglas<BR>
Hospital Research Centre, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, discussed his study<BR>
of touch &amp; how it affected baby rats: mothers were classified as<BR>
&quot;high-groomers&quot; (i.e. they touched &amp; groomed their babies a normal or large<BR>
amount), or as &quot;low-groomers&quot;.  Those baby rats who had &quot;high-grooming&quot;<BR>
moms showed higher levesl of &quot;good&quot; hormones in their bodies, and<BR>
subsequently also showed actual structural changes in their brains, as<BR>
compared to &quot;low-groomed&quot; baby rats.  <BR>
<BR>
In addition, when these two groups of baby rats were subsequently exposed<BR>
to stress, the ones who'd had &quot;high-grooming&quot; moms were able to deal with<BR>
the stress much better, whereas the &quot;low-groom&quot; rats became ill (I haven't<BR>
seen the actual paper yet, only heard him speak about it, so I don't know<BR>
yet what specific illnesses these &quot;bad-stress-handlers&quot; acquired that the<BR>
&quot;stress-resilient&quot; rats did not).<BR>
<BR>
And the final finding was that when these &quot;high-groomed&quot; baby rats grew up,<BR>
they in turn also exhibited a &quot;high-groom&quot; behaviour with THEIR babies, and<BR>
conversely with the &quot;low-groom&quot; baby raths that grew up to breed &amp; be moms.<BR>
<BR>
The signif. of this finding is that ...<BR>
<BR>
a) this is the first time that touch has been shown to not only activate<BR>
good hormonal pathways, but that the continual presence of these hormones<BR>
was shown to create actual physical changes in the brain (which could<BR>
explain a completely new method of &quot;evolution&quot; that does not rely on<BR>
classic Mendelian genetic theories), and that<BR>
<BR>
b) these behavour patterns (i.e. high-grooming vs. low-grooming) were then<BR>
passed on, which could thus POSSIBLY partly explain why (for example)<BR>
alcoholism, abuse, etc. seems to be &quot;passed&quot; from one generation to the next.<BR>
<BR>
Now, out of curiosity, I thought I'd make a hypothesis: &quot;People with IBD&quot;<BR>
(which includes me, of course!) &quot;may possibly acquire it because they come<BR>
from an environment where their bodies never learned how to handle stress<BR>
(and please note that &quot;stress&quot; does NOT ONLY mean emotional / physical, but<BR>
also things like toxins, bad diet, noise, crowding, competition, etc., OK?)<BR>
and thus their defensive systems break down easier than people whose body<BR>
systems learned how to handle stress in their upbringing&quot;.  <BR>
<BR>
So, specifically, if you want to participate in this survey, simply reply<BR>
to the question <BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Do you feel you grew up in an environment of emotional neglect <BR>
	(or even abuse), one that you now feel, in looking back, <BR>
	you'd call 'touch-deprived' or one low on good <BR>
	(i.e. non-threatening) physical non-sexual touch?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let me know by Sunday, and I'll get the results back to you, if we get more<BR>
than 10 people responding.<BR>
<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;9711070141.AA19776@swansong.amd.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
hi<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
does anyone know if Kombucha Tea is on the SCD diet list ? it looks interesting<BR>
as a source of heparin,  heparin was accidentally discovered to put UC and crohn's<BR>
into clinical remission, and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials at <BR>
several clinics across the country, i dont know how long till this drug is offered<BR>
but i have found a doctor who will consider its use on my son if i can find the protocol.<BR>
<BR>
the nearest clinic to me is the Oklahoma Foundation for Digestive Research in Okalahoma<BR>
City, they are still enrolling patients but you only have a 50/50 chance of getting<BR>
the heparin (the trial is double blind placebo controlled) but if you got it and went<BR>
into remission the SCD could be the tool that could keep you in remission, you might<BR>
not have to wait years to get healthy. i dont know if the other symptoms associated with <BR>
IBD diseases like FM etc get better, and i have read that once off heparin relapse is <BR>
rapid, so it's not a cure, the SCD still the closest thing to a cure.<BR>
<BR>
the information about the heparin trials is at:<BR>
<BR>
http://qurlyjoe.bu.edu/cducibs/heparin.html.<BR>
<BR>
i think the drug being used is LOVENOX (enoxaparin) and is made by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, i would <BR>
like to know if the drug is already approved for UC/crohns therapy in any European country<BR>
 and if so can you tell me if the protocol is available in a book. here in the US approved protocols <BR>
get published in books and are sold in book stores, i have access to German readers/speakers <BR>
(about thirty germans here right now) and the doctor we would use is Russian, so if there is a<BR>
 book i can special order it and get it translated, actually i can get it translated from any<BR>
european language since i live near a large university.<BR>
<BR>
by the way, LOVENOX is derived from procine intestinal mucosa, interesting ehh!<BR>

If you are drying meats yourself (perhaps with a good ol' Ronco), there<BR>
should not be a problem as long as the curing mix you use is free of harsh<BR>
chemicals and illegal ingredients.  I would, however, be very cautious about<BR>
packaged 'dried' or 'dehydrated' meats as they often contain nasty things.<BR>
 Anyone else have details?<BR>

I wish things had worked out better for your husband.  Going on the SCDiet is<BR>
a lot like quitting smoking or making other dramatic life changes...the<BR>
person making the committment has to have 100%  buy-in.  If your husband is<BR>
to try the SCDiet again or make any other changes in an attempt to help his<BR>
UC, it has to be HIS decision.<BR>
<BR>
Just my opinion - good luck to you and your husband.<BR>

I would like to clarify your questions. You are asking if CD and UC is<BR>
related to candida; if they go hand in hand; and if antibiotics are helpful.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately we have been brainwashed into thinking that all our problems<BR>
are not related. that different parts of the body are sick, when its the<BR>
whole body. All these words are just that - words. labels. to cut to the<BR>
chase, the system is toxic. it may be CALLED whatever anyone wants. that<BR>
toxicity is what causes what doctors LABEL different symptoms. the cause is<BR>
all the same. <BR>
<BR>
in order to have any problems, particularly bowel, digestion has failed.<BR>
digestion is what keeps us nourished. we caused digestion to fail whether it<BR>
be with bad food, birth control pills, antibiotics, or drugs, (the body DOES<BR>
NOT KNOW the difference between heroin and prozac. it doesnt know one is a<BR>
prescription some doctor wrote or an illegal drug that we have been<BR>
brainwashed into believing is bad and prescription drugs arent - its all<BR>
poison), etc.  anything that does not belong in the body and is continually<BR>
put in there will cause problems. this is why this generation is having the<BR>
kind of trouble they are. mcdonalds didnt exist 100 years ago. neither did<BR>
alot of processed stuff. the point is, in a normal colon there is a balance<BR>
between friendly bacteria and negative bacteria. when this balance is upset<BR>
(because of the above mentioned factors), the negative bacteria take over.<BR>
NOW it has to be cleaned up. plus whatever damage it caused has to be healed.<BR>
then the friendly bacteria has to be replaced to keep it under control.<BR>
antiobiotics SPECIFICALLY destroy friendly bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
it is your weakest link that is going to end up your specific problem. the<BR>
cause all originated in the same place. ever hear the phrase you are only as<BR>
strong as your weakest link? i never knew just how true that is. <BR>
<BR>
hope this helps -<BR>

Hello all,<BR>
<BR>
For anyone interested in the intestinal dysbiosis article, what I'm<BR>
proposing is that we start a mailing tree.  Where each person who<BR>
recieves a copy, mails one to the next person who wants a copy.  I think<BR>
the article is very good.  It backs up a lot of Elaine's research.  It<BR>

Thanks for the kind words Prateeksha!<BR>
<BR>
I'm finally back on line after being without power for 7 days. Being<BR>
smack dab in the middle of last week's blizzard in the Midwest left me<BR>
feeling like a pioneer. Amazing how much we take for granted a little<BR>
thing like ELECTRICITY! <BR>
<BR>
Happy to report that Little Sis Karen has been following the SCD for 1<BR>
1/2 weeks now and has noticed some remarkable things.  Her &quot;D&quot; has<BR>
greatly slowed down and her energy level is rising.  This is the first<BR>
time in years that changes in her CD have been for the better and not<BR>
the other way around. She had one minor setback over the weekend while<BR>
dining with her in-laws. She had forgotten her dry curd cottage cheese<BR>
and ate a couple of tablespoons of the regular stuff. (If anyone would<BR>
test whether cheating was possible on the SCD, it would be my sister!)<BR>
It caused her increased &quot;D&quot; and great cramping and started to bring on a<BR>
migraine (which she is prone to whenever her prednisone is at high<BR>
levels). She called me to say that yes, I was right, and she would not<BR>
cheat again (you realize, of course, that when Little Sisters tell Big<BR>
Sisters that they were wrong and you were right, it a moment to be<BR>
savored...) Luckily, it really means that she realizes the true value of<BR>
her new healthy regimen. <BR>
<BR>
Lastly, (yes I do tend to babble) we here in Nebraska are able to buy<BR>
DCCC in our local supermarkets under the brand GILLETTE DAIRY.  They<BR>
market milk, butter, cottage cheese, ice cream, etc.  I would assume<BR>
they are nationwide.  After hearing of other peoples' problems in<BR>
obtaining it, it was quite a shock to find it at the local store (I live<BR>
in a small rural town of 2,500 people).<BR>
<BR>
THANKS AND GOOD HEALTH TO ALL!<BR>

There is no real correlation between wine type and the amount of residual sugar. However,<BR>
dry wines are more popular with experienced wine drinkers and so I'd expect dry wines to<BR>
be the rule rather than the exception. With the varieties you mention, it would be unusual<BR>
for them to have much, if any, residual sugar. It would likely be mentioned on the label<BR>
if the winemaker made the wine with residual sugar to explain that the wine is different <BR>
and the reason why.<BR>

While I have a lot of wine in my cellar, it is mostly from my grapes and from those of<BR>
people I know. I rarely buy wine and don't want to pass myself off as much of a wine <BR>
expert.  While I have made some wine, mostly I just grow the grapes and drink a small <BR>
portion of the resulting wine. The winery I sell the grapes to, worries about turning the<BR>
grapes into wine and selling it. The 2 fields of viticulture (growing the grapes) and <BR>
enology (making wine from grapes) are quite different.<BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;Hello all,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;For anyone interested in the intestinal dysbiosis article, what I'm<BR>
&gt;proposing is that we start a mailing tree.  Where each person who<BR>
&gt;recieves a copy, mails one to the next person who wants a copy.  I think<BR>
&gt;the article is very good.  It backs up a lot of Elaine's research.  It<BR>
&gt;would be a good thing to show your doctor if you are needing support for<BR>
&gt;why you are on the SCD.<BR>

Look, let's not get all excited about this ... it's NOT like it's The Holy<BR>
Grail!  And specifically, remember I said that it's quite complex with lots<BR>
of medical terminology that you have to be able to understand to make it<BR>
worth your while plodding through?  So just maybe think about it before you<BR>
get all excited &amp; think you're missing out on something super-duper ...<BR>
it's good reading for those who can understand it, but I would hazard a<BR>
guess that at least half of this group (whoever that &quot;half&quot; is only you<BR>
know) will NOT be able to get anything out of it.<BR>
<BR>
In addition: this &quot;copy tree&quot; idea won't work: it's already not a crisp<BR>
copy to start with, and each time you copy a copy you lose clarity (I hope<BR>
you'd thought about that?).<BR>
<BR>
So, as I said, don't get all excited about it: if you can understand the<BR>
word &quot;dysbiosis&quot; WITHOUT running to a dictionary you're probably a good<BR>
candidate for asking for a copy, if not, just forget it &amp; stay focused on<BR>
other topics in this list.<BR>

<BR>
&gt;While shopping today I made a note of the ingredients in both Dry<BR>
&gt;Curd Cottage Cheese and Bakers Cheese.  Also peeked under the lid to<BR>
&gt;not the visible differences.  The brand name on both products was<BR>
&gt;Formost.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;DCCC - Milk ingredients, Microbial enzymes and Bacterial Culture.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Bakers Cheese - Milk ingredients, Bacterial Culture, Rennet,<BR>
&gt;Potassium Sorbate.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;DCCC has a cottage cheese look without any of the moisture.  Bakers<BR>
&gt;Cheese was creamy like a riccotta.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Here in Vancouver where Formost is one of the 'big' suppliers of<BR>
&gt;dairy products I would say that these two products are completely<BR>
&gt;different.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;For your information :-)<BR>

<BR>
Hi,<BR>
<BR>
While I can't straighten this thing out for those in Vancouver, I just<BR>
wanted to say that I am currently looking into this with regard to baker's<BR>
cheese in California. I've been recommending the Country Cheese Co. as a<BR>
supplier, and we have been using it for the last 5 or 6 months with no<BR>
problems that I am aware of. After the above post however, I was sure that<BR>
people would be calling poor Mario with all kinds of questions which he<BR>
could never answer(lactose questions that is), so I stopped by the store<BR>
and spoke with him myself. I now have the name and number of the cheesery<BR>
he buys from, and I will be calling them with the same questions tomorrow.<BR>
when I get the info I will post it. I know a few people are using this<BR>
source, and I don't see why we should all be wasting our time asking the<BR>
same questions of the same people. So stay tuned,...details at eleven.<BR>
<BR>
Also, although it comes in a tub like ricotta, this cheese is 98% fat free<BR>
or therabouts, and has a tangy flavor, not sweet at all. wether it is DCCC<BR>
or not, it is definitely not like ricotta.<BR>

&gt;Are raw (dried)  meats allowed on the SCD diet, such as pemmican, which is<BR>
&gt;definitely a paleo food??<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Pemmican is usually made with honey or blueberries.  If it's made with<BR>
another sweetener (i.e. if it's a commercially-made product instead of<BR>
home-made) I'd back away.<BR>
<BR>
Dried meat in general should be OK; again, if homemade &amp; no sugars (except<BR>
honey) then &quot;yes&quot;, if commercial I'd be careful.<BR>

My son, not I has the Crohn's disease.  But I would like to respond to your<BR>
survey.  I have always been very physically affectionate with all (3) my<BR>
children.  Only my youngest son has Crohn's.  I, however, grew up in a<BR>
physically and mentally abusive environment and am healthy as a horse - thank<BR>
goodness!  I also don't believe that such behavior, although learned<BR>
(obviously) during my growing up period, is necessarily &quot;passed on&quot;.  I have<BR>
tried very hard as a parent not to repeat any of the behaviors that my<BR>
parents exhibited.  Of course, everyone is different and each of us deals<BR>
with situations in very different ways.  I, therefore, do not discount your<BR>
theories but don't feel that myself or my family fit into those theories.<BR>
 Interesting though and I don't think you are alone in seeing some type of<BR>
correlation.<BR>

If you're on the SCD you are depending on self-education (and in the eyes of<BR>
the medical community, taking an large risk).  If the dysbiosis article<BR>
compels you, get it and read it - with a dictionary on one hand and a<BR>
biochemistry text on the other if need be.  <BR>
<BR>
As an author of research articles in another branch of biology, I can't tell<BR>

No, just that any residual sugar in the wine could be part sucrose to the extent that<BR>
sucrose was added when making the wine. Since a dry wine has no residual sugar, <BR>
it doesn't really matter whether sugar was added.<BR>
<BR>
I would disagree with her that most commercial wine is made with lots of added sugar. It<BR>
depends on the climate and grapes. Grapes grown in Canada would be more likely to need<BR>
additional sugar, while it would be a lot less likely that grapes grown in California would<BR>
need added sugar.<BR>

hi<BR>
<BR>
just salt his food with morton lite salt or NU-SALT (which is 100%<BR>
pottasium, you only need a tiny amount (morton lite salt is 340mg per 1/4<BR>
teaspoon, and you only need about 1/4 of that, once a day) it is waaay<BR>
cheaper than buying in pill form and my son doesn't even know he gets it!<BR>
one less thing to argue about or for him to worry about.<BR>
<BR>

I can't find the potassium chloride that someone mentioned. I went to the<BR>
health food store and all I could find was potassium. Should I be giving him<BR>
some postasium?<BR>

Undecylenic acid is supposed to be 6 times more effective than caprylic acid.<BR>
i am taking this information out of a magazine i just received days ago. I<BR>
dont know much about it, but I know Bill is taking it and he may be able to<BR>
give you some information.<BR>
<BR>
Also, the active ingredient in garlic is allicin. so you want to purchase a<BR>
product with allicin in it. to the best of my knowledge kyolic is the only<BR>
brand that does NOT contain it. <BR>

Pigs do not get crohn's disease but they can suffer from certain other<BR>
intestinal disorders that will give them diarrhea.  My husband is a small<BR>

True on the Undecylenic acid, but harder to find.  Thorne has a good<BR>
product.<BR>
<BR>
In terms of allicin and garlic, this is argued by many researchers and<BR>
mfgs of garlic products.  Allicin is actually a very unstable compound<BR>
and is questioned by many as to whether it is actually the active<BR>
ingredient.  Virtually all of the real studies that have been done<BR>
testing garlics effectiveness as an anti-microbial, has been done using<BR>
Liquid Kyolic Garlic and it has an awesome track record.  I have tried<BR>
other garlic supplements and believe from experience and reading that it<BR>
is the only form of garlic that I find worthwhile as an anti-microbial.<BR>
I am sure there are others, just none I have read about with the<BR>
documented studies behind it.  <BR>
<BR>
You can't use their powdered products canuse it has stuff not allowed on<BR>
SCD.  You can hide the Liguid Garlic in food as it would not be easy for<BR>
your son to take straight.<BR>

Thanks Jane.  I am, of course, aware that pigs do not get Crohn's.  There is,<BR>
however, a potentially related disease in many domestic animals that is known<BR>
as Johne's Disease.  My question was whether pigs suffer from Johne's, if<BR>
not, this may add to the validity that Lovenox helps Crohn's patients because<BR>
of its effects on Mycobacterium Paratuberculosis.<BR>

Hi Ted,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; .... as low carb diets have a strong diurectic effect, this effect leaves<BR>
&gt; you feeling washed out. cramps in the legs ... <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the info on leg cramps.  Looking back I did notice that I had<BR>
many leg cramps in the first 2 months of the diet.  I no longer get them<BR>
(in my fifth month).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Margaret,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; After about three weeks, my husband had to get off the diet, due to<BR>
&gt; bleeding, weakness and weight loss.  <BR>
<BR>
Speaking from experience (except the bleeding), this seems like a normal<BR>
part of starting the diet.  The body must adjust to the drastic changes.<BR>
Within 2-3 months I was doing very well, and still am.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; He was eating eggs - maybe that's why it didn't work.  <BR>
<BR>
Although I found them OK in the cheesecake recipe, eggs did not do well<BR>
until the D. was mostly gone (intermittentwith normal BM).  So yes you<BR>
should probably avoid them in the beginning.  I was able to re-introduce<BR>
them after 3 months, and I now eat eggs every day.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; he's still in pain, rarely goes out because of the diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
This will get better.  Hang in there, the results are worth it.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

&gt;No.  I was touched quite a bit growing up.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the answer.  Just remember (in case anyone did not THOROUGHLY<BR>
read the survey question): not merely &quot;touched a lot&quot;, but GOOD (i.e.<BR>
non-sexual non-agressive physical) touch, just so there's no confusion<BR>
here, OK?<BR>
