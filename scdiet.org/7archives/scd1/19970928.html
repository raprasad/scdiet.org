Dear Denise,<BR>
Hurray for you. I couldn't be happier to hear your great news.Although I<BR>
have been UC symptom free for over 2 years you've got me beat on the<BR>
fibromyalgia. I still suffer with it. Strange isn't it, how this thing<BR>
works. Well for now I'll be gratefull for the UC releif &amp; hope that some<BR>
day, my spondylitis and fibromyaligia follow suit.<BR>
Best wishes,<BR>
Rachel<BR>

I feel this way almost all of the time. I am not sure if it is from the<BR>
medicines--Asacol, 6MP--or the diet because I can't even remember when I<BR>
didn't feel this way. My body feels strong but my brain seems to be totally<BR>
disconnected from the rest of me. It's driving me nuts!<BR>

Jesemeana,  How gradually did your Dr. take you off  Asacol?   Was it just<BR>
drop it overnight or very gradually?    Jon is attempting to come off after<BR>
over a year on the diet.  Your success is encouraging, but please give us<BR>
more details.<BR>

&gt; Dear Cheryl,<BR>
&gt; Did you taper off the Pentasa slowly? <BR>
<BR>
Yes, I did.  I was even completely perfect for 3 months after I had<BR>
stopped taking the Pentasa.  It all started after I ate out on Father's<BR>
day.  I may have mistakenly had something I shouldn't have.  Things were<BR>
bad for a week and then got better.  I was convinced that everything<BR>
would be fine then..until another week had passed and I had yet another<BR>
bad week.  After things returned back to normal I was still convinced<BR>
that everything would be fine until a few weeks later.  It was then I<BR>
started taking the Pentasa again.  Things got better again and then I<BR>
ran out of Pentasa because they couldn't get any more in over the<BR>
weekend..things were fine over the weekend, so I decided I didn't need<BR>
to take the Pentasa anymore.  Things were great for about 2 weeks and<BR>
then the flare-monster raised it's ugly head again.  This is where I'm<BR>
at now.  So I'm guessing that my body is in need of taking the Pentasa<BR>
to get over this and then to maintain health, I'm not going to get so<BR>
cocky and stay on it for quite a while.  I was 11 months into the diet<BR>
when I first stopped taking the Pentasa.  <BR>
<BR>
It's so discouraging..I can't tell you.  Everything was going great.  <BR>

Dear Cheryl,<BR>
Have faith, everything will go great again. Experience has shown you that<BR>
the diet works, so this is just a down time you have to get past, and you<BR>
will. Meanwhile please try to keep your focus positive. I beleive that this<BR>
is key to your recovery. I know I can come across pollyanna sometimes, but<BR>
we both know that emotions can affect the progress of this disease....in<BR>
either direction.<BR>
Be strong and stay positive.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
In my search for alternative therapies that might complement the SCD, I <BR>
ran into a German &quot;Institut f&cedil;r Mikro–kologie&quot; in Herborn.<BR>
<BR>
They analyze your stool and based on an analysis of the bacteria and <BR>
fungus(?) recommend a therapie consisting of:<BR>
<BR>
1) Various &quot;symbioflor&quot; capsules with bacteria.<BR>
2) Autovaccine<BR>
<BR>
The Autovaccine is based on your own stool and is supposed to work on <BR>
the Mucosa-immunesystem(?).<BR>
<BR>
Now have any of you heard anything good or bad about these guys? Or <BR>
about that type of therapy? It seems very serious, but I can't figure <BR>
out if it really is.<BR>
<BR>

Hi, Rachel:<BR>
<BR>
(You live in Seattle, right?)<BR>
<BR>
I'm just going through my 600-e-mail backlog, was off-line 2 months while<BR>
in hospital for temporary hip replacement PLUS they threw in a bowel<BR>
operation &quot;free&quot;!  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
I have to go back in a few weeks for a &quot;permanent&quot; artifical hip, and they<BR>
hopefully by spring next year I'll finally get a life again!<BR>
<BR>
I noted with great interest that YOU TOO have both AS AND UC ... I'm 42,<BR>
and have had both since about age 10.<BR>
<BR>
So &quot;welcome&quot; to the special world of spondies-and-colitics!<BR>
<BR>
		See you,<BR>

&gt;Dear Ted,<BR>
&gt;I admire your &quot;take action&quot; attitude. I would be happy to follow your lead.<BR>
&gt;Please advise me where to send letters. As for the auto-immune connection,<BR>
&gt;I have spondylitis, UC and fibromyalia, all considered auto immune. We are<BR>
&gt;2 sisters (I'm the oldest) &amp; 2 brothers. One brother has severe scoriatic<BR>
&gt;arthritis (supposedly, scoriacis is the skins form of arthritis) and my<BR>
&gt;sister has rhuematoid arthritis. These are also considered auto immune.<BR>
&gt;Thank the powers that be, my baby brother is disease free.<BR>

&gt;Good morning all,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;A couple of questions which I'd appreciate help with:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1) How long can the homemade yoghurt stay fresh in the<BR>
&gt;   refrigerator once it's been &quot;cooked&quot;?  More than a<BR>
&gt;   couple of days?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We've made &quot;tons&quot; of homemade yoghurt (we now ferment it more like 36 hours<BR>
instead of just 24), and it stays hale &amp; hearty in the fridge for at least<BR>
a month, so NO WORRIES!<BR>

I just thought i'd pass this along in case it is of interest to anyone:<BR>
<BR>
The other day, I was doing some work in the office of a pediatric GI<BR>
Dr./researcher/proffesor at UCSF. As I repaired his machine we had an<BR>
interesting conversation. It all started when I told him of my son's<BR>
condition (CD) and the fact that he is a patient in the pedi. GI clinic<BR>
there. When I told him about the diet we were on he was very interested to<BR>
find out more. He has been in the field for a long time and seemed to<BR>
remember the Dr's Haas (if only by name). when I explained the theory<BR>
behind the diet to him, he did not proceed to find fault with it, in fact,<BR>
it seemed to make a great deal of sense to him.<BR>
<BR>
He then told me of something that had been developed there at UC which<BR>
might prove or disprove the idea of an overgrowth of bacteria/yeast. It<BR>
seems that the human body does not produce hydrogen, atleast not on it's<BR>
own. The only source of H in the body is as the byproduct of microbial<BR>
digestion of carbohydrates. This hydrogen is measurable in the breath. His<BR>
suggestion was that you could measure breath H before and after ingestion<BR>
of carbohydrates after first abstaining from them for a while, and then<BR>
compare the two levels to see if there had been an increase. I explained to<BR>
him that, since ridgid compliance with the diet was necessary, it would be<BR>
counter-productive to undertake a test which required one to go against the<BR>
restrictions of the SCD. However, I thought it was interesting enough to<BR>
pass along.<BR>

Hi Everyone!!!!<BR>
<BR>
I heard something very interesting and thought I would pass it along.<BR>
<BR>
My brother, a dermatologist, has a patient who's daughter works for a<BR>
pharmeceutical company in Carlsbad, California by the name of ISIS Inc.  He<BR>
told me that this company is in stage 3 testing of a new drug for Crohn's<BR>
and related conditions.  The comany plans to go for FDA approval in the<BR>
spring '98.  They are proclaiming that this is going to be a wonder drug<BR>
for all.<BR>
<BR>
At any rate, I found the company on the web under the name ISIP and found<BR>
some interesting news about the drug.  They are currently seeking people to<BR>
participate in the study.<BR>
<BR>
Although, this has nothing to do with the SCD, I nonetheless thought it<BR>
would be of interest to someone, because we need to consider any and all<BR>
options available to us.  What may work for some may not work for others.<BR>

Here's their website:http://www.isip.com/antisens.htm<BR>
I think they'de need to inject the stuff into the affected organ (colon,<BR>
I guess) for it to work.  It's supposed to alter the genetics or<BR>
something like that.  Seems somewhat promising!  Imaging getting a shot,<BR>
and then after a short healing time, being all better!<BR>

&gt;Hi Denise,<BR>
<BR>
I was so interested in your comments, particularly, about the amoebas.  I<BR>
got amoebas while in India, and the different medical people I approached<BR>
about my symptoms, were unable to find them so I had them for several<BR>
years, with the diarrhea, bloating, cramping going on all this time...I was<BR>
told I wasn't absorbing fat, but that I didnd't have amoebas...then I<BR>
returned to the US and had tests; they didn't find them either; more tests<BR>
two years later, and they found them!  Entamoeba histolytica cysts and<BR>
trophozoites.  Flagyl and Iodoquinal were prescribed for 7-10 days only and<BR>
that was all I was told to take to treat these varmints.  I have never<BR>
gotten rid of the symptoms and now my symptoms have escalated.  Since being<BR>
on the diet, I have also started with two herbs to treat &quot;amoebas&quot; since my<BR>
wholistic practitioner maintains there is no way I could have gotten rid of<BR>
the amoebas even though the several stool tests I have taken since taking<BR>
the flagyl and iodoquinal have shown negative for amoebas.  The herbs are<BR>
Parex (take 6 weeks) and Nature's Biotics, (indefinitely.)  These<BR>
supposedly kill the amoebas (if they are indeed still there lurking in my<BR>
intestines) and restore the balance of healthy bacteria in my intestines.<BR>
<BR>
Like you, I have had the loose stool and lowered vitality and am noticing<BR>
that my energy is coming up remarkably since taking these herbs!  Although<BR>
I still have the loose stool at this time.<BR>
<BR>
What is Yodoxin (an anti-protozoal drug)?<BR>
<BR>
Any other comments about your treatment would be appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I just wanted to write in to say that at the end of being on the diet<BR>
&gt;for 8 months, I am now symptom free.  I also have been able to begin<BR>
&gt;eating dairy again, which I wasn't able to for quite awhile.  I have<BR>
&gt;followed the diet fanatically.  In August I had an upserge in health<BR>
&gt;after doing a 20 day course of an anti-protozoal drug (Yodoxin) after a<BR>
&gt;test showed that I was infected with an amoeba (and probably had been<BR>
&gt;for the last seven years).  Since doing the drug, the last remaining<BR>
&gt;symptoms I had that I was unable to shake, loose stool and lowered<BR>
&gt;vitality, went away.  I can't believe how healthy I feel now.  As a side<BR>
&gt;point, my fibromyalgia symptoms are virtually gone now too.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So, I remain on the diet, faithfully, and will continue to stay on it<BR>
&gt;for another year.  I just wanted to write in and tell everyone, because<BR>
&gt;I used to be really sick and weak and I never thought I would ever get<BR>
&gt;my health back.  So, everyone, hang in there.<BR>
&gt;<BR>

&gt;has anyone tried taking Lois Langs bread and frying it and salting? after the<BR>
&gt;bread is made and refrigerated, cut it in pieces like french fries, then fry<BR>
&gt;and salt.<BR>

Hey Joan,<BR>
<BR>
I noticed in Elaine's comments, that she suggested putting slices of this<BR>
bread in the oven and heating, until it turns to &quot;cracker&quot; consistency.  I<BR>
haven't baked the bread yet, but notice I really yearn for &quot;crunchy&quot; food<BR>
which I always have preferred to soft sweets.<BR>

Hi Cheryl and Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
I totally agree with you Rachel, about the emotions affecting progress of<BR>
my disease.  Last week, I started a &quot;Anger Journal&quot; which I write in when I<BR>
first get up; then I tear out the page(s) and burn it over my toilet and<BR>
flush it down the toilet...feels wonderful.  I am noticing a lot of anger<BR>
coming up around my illness!  And when I &quot;process&quot; it on paper, and &quot;flush<BR>
it down the toilet&quot;, there is something very symbolic about this in<BR>
connection with the diarrhea, for me.  It feels like the diarrhea is my<BR>
anger!  I have been feeling more &quot;space&quot; inside me and &quot;lighter&quot; since I<BR>
started this last week.  Just wanted to share this with you in hopes that<BR>
maybe it will work for someone else.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;It's so discouraging..I can't tell you.  Everything was going great.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Cheryl<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Dear Cheryl,<BR>
&gt;Have faith, everything will go great again. Experience has shown you that<BR>
&gt;the diet works, so this is just a down time you have to get past, and you<BR>
&gt;will. Meanwhile please try to keep your focus positive. I beleive that this<BR>
&gt;is key to your recovery. I know I can come across pollyanna sometimes, but<BR>
&gt;we both know that emotions can affect the progress of this disease....in<BR>
&gt;either direction.<BR>
&gt;Be strong and stay positive.<BR>
&gt;Rachel<BR>

hey Prateeksha -<BR>
<BR>
no, i missed where elaine suggested toasting the bread in the oven. didnt see<BR>
in the book - maybe was talked about on the list serve sometime. the one area<BR>
i am failing in is just this - i need something crunchy. the fried carrotts<BR>
are EXCELLENT and i do enjoy except i dont have time to sit and grate<BR>
carrotts to make enough for the week (like going to the store and buying a<BR>
bag of chips). if anyone has any suggestions on something crunchy it would be<BR>
great. but looking at the list of vegetables, there arent any i can come up<BR>
with that would end up crunchy besides the carrotts.<BR>
<BR>
also, is parex a drug or a natural product? if it is a natural product, who<BR>
is the manufacturer and where do you order? natures biotics doesnt kill<BR>
parasites - they are soil based organisms made up of friendly bacteria. they<BR>
are also transients, meaning they do not stay in the body. somewhere down the<BR>
road, you will have to reimplant with friendly bacteria - acidopholis and<BR>
bifidus. these are the two major strains that are in a normal system. this is<BR>
what is ultimately needed to rebuild.<BR>

The cause of CD!<BR>
<BR>
For several months I have been written on this mail which I send to<BR>
everybody out there looking for some way to get back to a normal life and<BR>
any doctor thinking twice.<BR>
<BR>
When I was sendt to hospital in april 1993, I made two commitments to myself.<BR>
<BR>
1. Establish a support group for CD.<BR>
2. Find the cause of CD.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the first point was soon achieved, but find a solution to the other..!<BR>
But after researching and listening to speeches I reached a hypotese:<BR>
<BR>
Hypotese 1:<BR>
<BR>
The cause of Crohns Disease is a Cromium Deficiensy.<BR>
<BR>
Now back to 1993. My first idea was that CD simply was food intolerance.<BR>
Many trials show a notorious link between CD and allergy. But when I learned<BR>
more abouth Candida Albicans and how CD would manifest so different in<BR>
individuals,  I began to think twice.<BR>
<BR>
Listening to a speech held by Dr. Halstensen february 1997 became a<BR>
breakthrough for my wiews upon both UC and CD. He showed that CD did not<BR>
manifest itself in the gut at all! Is was in fact situated in the blood<BR>
wessels near by the gut wall. He showed that CD was an immune reaction in<BR>
the blood wall leading to an immune complex blocking the bloodstream. Then<BR>
this would lead to cell death close to the wessel and in the end into the<BR>
gut, creating a kind of spot. Or worse a deep hole in the wall gut. This<BR>
shows clearly that CD cannot solely be considered as an inflammation in the gut!<BR>
<BR>
To question remains:<BR>
<BR>
1. What causes this inflammation in the blood wessels?<BR>
2. Why does this happen so close to the gut wall?<BR>
<BR>
Some of the answers I have found in the books to Sharon A. Rogers. Now<BR>
Sharon is working with enviromental medicine. She started looking at how<BR>
formaldehyd, pesticides and pollution creates diseases in persons. This work<BR>
led to studies of how mineral deficiencies could mimic symptoms from<BR>
toxides. In the book: &quot;Tired or Toxic?&quot; she wrote about how a Cromium<BR>
deficiency would influence on - you may have guessed it - the blood wessel<BR>
walls! Now, one of the problems for the body is to get rid of so called free<BR>
radicals. This is molecyles which have one electron to much. I can react<BR>
with every cell in the body, thereby destroying parts of the cell, like the<BR>
DNA. Any minute a free radical can be able make a hole in the blood wessel<BR>
wall. No problem, the body will repair it. But with what?<BR>
<BR>
You guessed it again: Cromium!! But what happens if there is nothing left to<BR>
use? Then the body uses whatever sutable, like cholestrol or Calsium coming<BR>
from excess use of supplement of this mineral that we get so much of from<BR>
food anyway! This leads to a hardening of the wessel wall. It may be<BR>
inflamed. But why mostly inflammation near the gut? First I thought that<BR>
someting like foodstuff or acetaldehyde could create this wessel wass<BR>
inflammation. But why could mercury leaking out of the teeth not lead to CD<BR>
in the mouth but more distance in ileum for instance? <BR>
<BR>
Then I suddenly got an idea! (When I was asleep, of course..)  Whenever<BR>
there is an inflammation in the gut, macrofages will be busy eating enemies.<BR>
This  is done by releasing excess amounts of free radicals. So, this is the<BR>
solution! The area around he inflamed gut will have a high consentration of<BR>
free radicals leading to holes in the blood wessel walls.<BR>
<BR>
Hypotese 2:<BR>
<BR>
CD is a double inflammation, one int the gut and one in the blood wessel<BR>
walls near by the gut. The cause of the inflammation in the gut is highly<BR>
individual. The inflammation in the blood wessel wall is created by excess<BR>
freee radicals from the inflammtion in the gut and too little Cromium left<BR>
to repair the wessel walls.<BR>
<BR>
If this hypotesis is right there are three mesuares that POSSIBLE CAN cure CD:<BR>
<BR>
1. Supplement of Cromium.<BR>
2. High doses of antioxodants to stop free radicals.<BR>
3. Diet to stop the inflammetion in the gut.<BR>

Dear Joan,<BR>
<BR>
Cheese chips have satisfied the crunchy tooth around this house.   Have you<BR>
ever made a toasted cheese sandwich on a skillet or griddle and had some of<BR>
the cheese run out and down onto the hot surface?  Having this happen to me<BR>
gave me the idea to try making cheese chips.  It works great.  I use grated<BR>
Colby or Longhorn cheese and place a thin layer on a griddle over low heat.<BR>
 The cheese will melt and gradually brown.  When one side is brown, flip the<BR>
cheese (like a pancake) and brown the other side.  You can make bite size<BR>
chips, or one enormous chip which you then break up into bite size pieces.<BR>
 These are great to eat with Taco salad, a bowl of soup or salsa, or just<BR>
plain for munchies.   Hope you will enjoy them as much as we have.<BR>
<BR>

What's chromium?  You mean the hard, metallic element used in nickel and<BR>
copper alloys?  Should we eat our coins?  I don't get it.. where and how<BR>
do we ingest chromiuim?<BR>
With the free-radicals, does anyone know what are the best sources of<BR>
free radicals?  I've heard carrots, tomatoes are good, and carcinogens<BR>
(overcooked meat, ccigarettes) are bad.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Hypotese 1:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; The cause of Crohns Disease is a Cromium Deficiensy.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Now back to 1993. My first idea was that CD simply was food<BR>
&gt; intolerance.<BR>
&gt; Many trials show a notorious link between CD and allergy. But when I<BR>
&gt; learned<BR>
&gt; more abouth Candida Albicans and how CD would manifest so different in<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; individuals,  I began to think twice.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Listening to a speech held by Dr. Halstensen february 1997 became a<BR>
&gt; breakthrough for my wiews upon both UC and CD. He showed that CD did<BR>
&gt; not<BR>
&gt; manifest itself in the gut at all! Is was in fact situated in the<BR>
&gt; blood<BR>
&gt; wessels near by the gut wall. He showed that CD was an immune reaction<BR>
&gt; in<BR>
&gt; the blood wall leading to an immune complex blocking the bloodstream.<BR>
&gt; Then<BR>
&gt; this would lead to cell death close to the wessel and in the end into<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; gut, creating a kind of spot. Or worse a deep hole in the wall gut.<BR>
&gt; This<BR>
&gt; shows clearly that CD cannot solely be considered as an inflammation<BR>
&gt; in the gut!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; To question remains:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; 1. What causes this inflammation in the blood wessels?<BR>
&gt; 2. Why does this happen so close to the gut wall?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Some of the answers I have found in the books to Sharon A. Rogers. Now<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Sharon is working with enviromental medicine. She started looking at<BR>
&gt; how<BR>
&gt; formaldehyd, pesticides and pollution creates diseases in persons.<BR>
&gt; This work<BR>
&gt; led to studies of how mineral deficiencies could mimic symptoms from<BR>
&gt; toxides. In the book: &quot;Tired or Toxic?&quot; she wrote about how a Cromium<BR>
&gt; deficiency would influence on - you may have guessed it - the blood<BR>
&gt; wessel<BR>
&gt; walls! Now, one of the problems for the body is to get rid of so<BR>
&gt; called free<BR>
&gt; radicals. This is molecyles which have one electron to much. I can<BR>
&gt; react<BR>
&gt; with every cell in the body, thereby destroying parts of the cell,<BR>
&gt; like the<BR>
&gt; DNA. Any minute a free radical can be able make a hole in the blood<BR>
&gt; wessel<BR>
&gt; wall. No problem, the body will repair it. But with what?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; You guessed it again: Cromium!! But what happens if there is nothing<BR>
&gt; left to<BR>
&gt; use? Then the body uses whatever sutable, like cholestrol or Calsium<BR>
&gt; coming<BR>
&gt; from excess use of supplement of this mineral that we get so much of<BR>
&gt; from<BR>
&gt; food anyway! This leads to a hardening of the wessel wall. It may be<BR>
&gt; inflamed. But why mostly inflammation near the gut? First I thought<BR>
&gt; that<BR>
&gt; someting like foodstuff or acetaldehyde could create this wessel wass<BR>
&gt; inflammation. But why could mercury leaking out of the teeth not lead<BR>
&gt; to CD<BR>
&gt; in the mouth but more distance in ileum for instance?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Then I suddenly got an idea! (When I was asleep, of course..)<BR>
&gt; Whenever<BR>
&gt; there is an inflammation in the gut, macrofages will be busy eating<BR>
&gt; enemies.<BR>
&gt; This  is done by releasing excess amounts of free radicals. So, this<BR>
&gt; is the<BR>
&gt; solution! The area around he inflamed gut will have a high<BR>
&gt; consentration of<BR>
&gt; free radicals leading to holes in the blood wessel walls.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Hypotese 2:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; CD is a double inflammation, one int the gut and one in the blood<BR>
&gt; wessel<BR>
&gt; walls near by the gut. The cause of the inflammation in the gut is<BR>
&gt; highly<BR>
&gt; individual. The inflammation in the blood wessel wall is created by<BR>
&gt; excess<BR>
&gt; freee radicals from the inflammtion in the gut and too little Cromium<BR>
&gt; left<BR>
&gt; to repair the wessel walls.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; If this hypotesis is right there are three mesuares that POSSIBLE CAN<BR>
&gt; cure CD:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; 1. Supplement of Cromium.<BR>
&gt; 2. High doses of antioxodants to stop free radicals.<BR>
&gt; 3. Diet to stop the inflammetion in the gut.<BR>

<BR>
since this list serve is used specifically for diet, i will keep this short.<BR>
i was wondering when SOMEONE was going to catch on, but it still  isnt quite<BR>
the answer. the information Odd gave was closer to anything i've heard you<BR>
guys talk about.<BR>
<BR>
yes, someTHING is causing your cd (and uc for that matter). it doesnt just<BR>
happen. you guys need detox. research it for yourself. diet only controls<BR>
symptoms. you have immune system problems and drugs only further suppress it.<BR>
chromium and antioxidants arent quite the answer either as assimilation is a<BR>
problem in systems like ours. (you cannot build up without cleansing first).<BR>
inflammation is an indication of someTHING irritating the gut. you cant get<BR>
the chromium in (im not against supplementation, its just not going to work<BR>
either by itself) until things are cleaned up. i think all of you would<BR>
benefit by signing up to the list serve:<BR>

Hello everybody:<BR>
I was just discussing the diet with a friend and he asked me if I had tried yuca bread as a bread substitute. I've never heard of this.<BR>
Is anybody familiar with this type of bread?<BR>
Do you know if it's OK for the diet?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks.<BR>

Dear Matthew,<BR>
<BR>
Chromium can be purchased at your local health food store where vitamins<BR>
are sold.  Jean Carper, author of the NY Times bestseller, &quot;Food, Your<BR>
Miracle Medicine&quot; and &quot;Stop Aging Now&quot; recommends 200 micrograms/day of<BR>
Chromium Picolate which is a particular organic-type supplement more<BR>
readily absorbed than Chromium choloride to:<BR>
<BR>
lower insuline levels<BR>
lower triglycerides<BR>
raisegood-type HDL Cholesterol<BR>
discourage artery-clogging and heart disease<BR>
lower bad-type blood cholesterol<BR>
normalize blood sugar<BR>
reduce risk of adult-onset diabetes<BR>
thwart cancer growth<BR>
boost immune functioning<BR>
INCREASE ENERGY<BR>
increase lean body mass<BR>
rev up production of antiaging hormone DHEA<BR>
EXTEND LIFE.<BR>
<BR>
Also good sources of chromium are niacin-bound chromiums, such as<BR>
ChromeMate and Solgar GTF chromium.<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
Yesterday, on the news I caught a portion of a newsupdate on MRI LIPOIC<BR>
ACID, which is touted to be a powerful antioxidant; more so than others<BR>
tested.  Does anyone else know more about this news?<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What's chromium?  You mean the hard, metallic element used in nickel and<BR>
&gt;copper alloys?  Should we eat our coins?  I don't get it.. where and how<BR>
&gt;do we ingest chromiuim?<BR>
&gt;With the free-radicals, does anyone know what are the best sources of<BR>
&gt;free radicals?  I've heard carrots, tomatoes are good, and carcinogens<BR>
&gt;(overcooked meat, ccigarettes) are bad.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Very interesting, but Odd......<BR>

&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; For several months I have been written on this mail which I send to<BR>

&gt;&gt; any doctor thinking twice.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; When I was sendt to hospital in april 1993, I made two commitments to<BR>

&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; 1. Establish a support group for CD.<BR>
&gt;&gt; 2. Find the cause of CD.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; Now, the first point was soon achieved, but find a solution to the<BR>

Hi, I haven't jumped totally into SCD yet.  While I've been sugar and yeast<BR>
free for over a year now, I still eat rice, oats, and potatoes.  Here's<BR>
the problem.  I don't tolerate dairy, fruit or honey.  So on SCD, what does<BR>
that leave?  Animal protein, vegetables, and nuts.  That's even more limiting<BR>
than what I'm doing now.  Can I get enough nutrients/carbohydrates from these<BR>
3 categories of food?  What can I have for breakfast (besides eggs and nut<BR>
muffins)?<BR>
<BR>
I know how important diet is because I can see how badly certain foods<BR>
affect me, but you know, it does get a bit frustrating after awhile to<BR>
have such a limited diet.  On the other hand, I do know that it could be<BR>

Hi, Joan,<BR>
<BR>
Toasting bread in the oven is suggested by Elaine in the &quot;Questions for<BR>
Elaine&quot;, either part 1 or 2 (can't remember).  She said to just slice it<BR>
real thin and toast in the oven and it becomes a cracker!  ummm, I love<BR>
crackers, but haven't baked Lois Lang's bread yet.<BR>
<BR>
With regard to grating...I have DISCOVERED one of the greatest things in my<BR>
kitchen.  For years, I have had a Quisenart food processor, but never used<BR>
the grater or slicer attachments...since taking up the diet, I am now<BR>
grating zucchini or carrots (3 or 4) in a matter of about 10 SECONDS!!!!!!<BR>
I keep my food processor out on the kitchen countertop, readily accessible<BR>
for all the cooking, mixing, grating I do these days.<BR>
<BR>
Another thing I do is when I make a batch of yogurt, I immediately put<BR>
about 1 1/2 cups into a yogurt strainer in a bowl, cover, place in the<BR>
fridge.  This &quot;cream cheese&quot; is used in the cheesecake instead of regular<BR>
yogurt  as well as a spread at breakfast on muffins.  It makes the<BR>
cheesecake more of the consistency of cheesecake!  I love it.  I also don't<BR>
grate lemon, but rather, use 1 tsp. of lemon extract (without sugar...some<BR>
has sugar in it, beware!)  And, I use 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1 tsp.<BR>
of almond extract.  These combinations of extract make a wonderful,<BR>
delicate cheesecake flavor and if you can take the fruit (which I can't),<BR>
slice fresh strawberries, or raspberries/blueberries and serve on top.  I'm<BR>
sure it would be really wonderful.  I don't make the almond crsp crust for<BR>
it, since I am not yet ready for nuts except in nutflour.<BR>
<BR>
I tried the carrot chips and found them to be quite salty, so I would<BR>
suggest getting cheese that is not salted.  Also they had a wierd taste.<BR>
Maybe there was a chemical added to the cheese I was tasting.  So, maybe,<BR>
get the &quot;cleanest&quot; cheese, without salt and chemicals, you can find.<BR>
<BR>
Other dried fruits I have tried in the whole foods grocery store are<BR>
Papaya, and pineapple which have delicious flavors....however, I find I<BR>
can't handle them right now...cause cramping.<BR>
<BR>
PAREX:<BR>
My chiro has recommended that I detox so I take the parex.<BR>
Parex is a natural product, supplied by my network chiro who buys it<BR>
wholesale from the manufacturer:  Metagenics, Inc., San Clemente,<BR>
California, 92673, USA.  It's called &quot;Parex Intensive Care&quot; and is a blend<BR>
of herbs and herbal extracts with ficin (from F.glabrata, whatever the hell<BR>
that is.)<BR>
<BR>
This is for colon cleansing of suspected amoebas, so you can imagine how<BR>
strong it is!  Along with it, I am taking Nature's Biotics, which is a host<BR>
of friendly bacteria to restore balance to the intestine.  It has among<BR>
other bacteria, acidodophilis and bifidus.  I plan to take it indefinitely.<BR>
<BR>
Regards, Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;hey Prateeksha -<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;no, i missed where elaine suggested toasting the bread in the oven. didnt see<BR>
&gt;in the book - maybe was talked about on the list serve sometime. the one area<BR>
&gt;i am failing in is just this - i need something crunchy. the fried carrotts<BR>
&gt;are EXCELLENT and i do enjoy except i dont have time to sit and grate<BR>
&gt;carrotts to make enough for the week (like going to the store and buying a<BR>
&gt;bag of chips). if anyone has any suggestions on something crunchy it would be<BR>
&gt;great. but looking at the list of vegetables, there arent any i can come up<BR>
&gt;with that would end up crunchy besides the carrotts.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;also, is parex a drug or a natural product? if it is a natural product, who<BR>
&gt;is the manufacturer and where do you order? natures biotics doesnt kill<BR>
&gt;parasites - they are soil based organisms made up of friendly bacteria. they<BR>
&gt;are also transients, meaning they do not stay in the body. somewhere down the<BR>
&gt;road, you will have to reimplant with friendly bacteria - acidopholis and<BR>
&gt;bifidus. these are the two major strains that are in a normal system. this is<BR>
&gt;what is ultimately needed to rebuild.<BR>

Hi Liz,<BR>
<BR>
In February, I successfully used the diet straight from the book to stop<BR>
a UC flair.  It worked perfectly.  Then I fell off the wagon and had<BR>
another flair.  This time I couldn't handle the honey and fruit and I<BR>
didn't make out so well.<BR>
<BR>
I went on the strict startup diet, without honey, gelatin, fruit juice<BR>
and I had a really bad time.  I was ok for a couple of days (1<BR>
semi-solid bm per day, down from 6-8 per day with diarehea), but then I<BR>
got very depressed, very very low energy, and major diareaha and<BR>
bleeding.  I stuck with it for three days -- then I had a wonderful<BR>
starchy breakfast with potatoes, orange juice, the works.  I felt much,<BR>
much better, although the diareaha was still there, but not as often.<BR>
<BR>
My solution was to add one grain -- millet -- not starchy, fairly low<BR>
carb.  Just to experiment, I left out dairy, including butter.  Later I<BR>
added buckwheat.  So mostly I was eating meat, eggs and millet and<BR>
buckwheat, and carrots.  This worked for me as well as the SCD when I<BR>
first tried it.<BR>
<BR>
When you say that you are yeast free for a year, do you mean that you<BR>
don't eat any yeasty foods, or are you saying that your yeast infection<BR>
is under control?  If you cannot tolerate fruit and honey, that may be a<BR>
sign of a yeast infection.  If you're familar with candida, maybe you<BR>
should treat for that with some suppliments in addition to the diet.<BR>
However, rice and potatoes are not the best for candida control since<BR>
they are high starch foods.  That's why I selected millet and buckwheat<BR>
for my carbs.  They are also readily avialable and fairly inexpensive.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this was of some help.<BR>
<BR>
Bill<BR>

<BR>
I sympathize, Liz.  I've been having the same problem.  One thing I want to<BR>
ask:  have you tried yogurt made per the instructions for the SCD?  I have<BR>
found that I tolerate it well even though I don't normally do well with<BR>
dairy.  This could be true if your intolerance is for lactose.  It still<BR>
doesn't solve the carbo problem, but it can be another option.<BR>
<BR>
Also, if you tolerate beans, they are a good source of carbos.  There has<BR>
been some discussion lately on the list about using a food mill to remove<BR>
the skins which are sometimes a source of problems for people.<BR>
<BR>
The initial period on the diet is hard, but look on it as an experiment for<BR>
2 weeks to see what happens.  Even if you are not getting enough carbos for<BR>
that period, you will probably be OK.  It will at least let you know if the<BR>
approach works for you.<BR>

Hi Liz,<BR>
<BR>
I am not tolerating fruit either and have had problems tolerating dairy in<BR>
the past; however, I can eat the 36-hour fermented yogurt we make from the<BR>
recipe in the book (Elaine says to ferment for 24 hours); and something I<BR>
do that you might want to experiment with in order to get those carbs for<BR>
breakfast is to make the Zucchini muffins and I put about 4 cups of grated<BR>
zucchini into the recipe rather than 3; also the carrot cake recipe, make<BR>
it into muffins and add a few more shredded carrots to it.  I love these<BR>
for breakfast.  Also, I make the cheesecake and eat it for breakfast or<BR>
snacks.  I feel the dry curd cottage cheese which has less than l/2 of 1<BR>
per cent of lactose in it, is well tolerated by me.  I mix it with the<BR>
yogurt and eat it just about every morning for breakfast.  Try these and<BR>
see what happens.  I'm still not on nuts, or raw anything, so I do have<BR>
problems tolerating foods on the diet, also.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, Liz.<BR>

<BR>
the Group<BR>
(I have tried to keep this short.)<BR>
It is great to see as many postings that have been showing up on the SCD<BR>
list the last few months. While I have not been active  in  postings for<BR>
some time, certainly the subjects  appearing on the list continue to hold<BR>
my interest.<BR>
 However I must plead guilty of receiving more benefits from this list than<BR>
 having returned in the way of postings of encouragement to the new comers<BR>
who are desperately in need of  help to expel their fears, as well to offer<BR>
assistance with this diet. If my memory serves me correctly  there are<BR>
others like myself, after becoming stable on the SCD diet find  all too<BR>
convenient to quietly slip away.   So then for those on the list, who have<BR>
nothing but fears and questions, may I relate this success story for you of<BR>
how the SCD turned my life around and made live worthwhile again.<BR>
<BR>
Fifteen years  ago I found myself bleeding from the rectum, so severely I<BR>
was forced to empty the colon approx. every twenty minutes.  I was of the<BR>
opinion I suffered from  bleeding internal hemorrhoids  in the lower colon.<BR>
 Our family doctor advised me to make an  appointment with a Doctor who<BR>
specialized in problems of the bowel. After the  examination I was shocked<BR>
when the Doctor stated =93Good news - you do not have Cancer. But you do have<BR>
Ulcerative Colitis, and that may or may not contribute to cancer of the bowel.<BR>
  Frightening words for a man who would all but faint when a nurse<BR>
drew blood from his arm.  <BR>
How shall I cure this disease Doctor? <BR>
 There is no known cure.<BR>
  I will venture everyone on this list has a similar story.<BR>
After finding this list in its early days it was comforting to learn there<BR>
was a place where the problems of IBD could be discussed openly.<BR>
<BR>
I started the diet in mar. 1993, failed it after three weeks, then tried<BR>
the second time. By the end of the same year the colon was well on its way<BR>
to full recovery. I was symptom free with no flares for well more than two<BR>
years. I used medications for only the first month during that period. I<BR>
made the yogurt, stuck to the book, although I never did do any baking, and<BR>
still dont. Chopped, fresh or frozen mixed veggies and fruit. I can eat<BR>
apples, oranges, bananas by the bushel. I started with small amounts of<BR>
fish, chicken, scrambled eggs, beef and very crisp bacon later on in the<BR>
diet I drank very weak coffee black. My colon appeared to have recovered<BR>
completely. I felt so improved, health wise after two and some half years<BR>
with no flares, that I decided I could now go back to eating some starch on<BR>
a limited basis. That was a serious mistake. Within six to eight months I<BR>
was bleeding from the colon, with  severe pains in both sides, to the<BR>
extent I could not lie on either side in bed at night. I lost all the<BR>
weight I had gained in the previous two years.<BR>
<BR>
In July of 1996 I was able to view my colon on closed circuit TV while<BR>
having a  sigmoidoscopy.<BR>
The inflammation was limited to approx. half way around a cross section and<BR>
12 inches (30cm) long. This damage resulted in approx. 6 to eight months<BR>
from allowing  limited starch in my diet. I went back on Medication for two<BR>
weeks until the bleeding stopped, also started back full time on the diet.<BR>
I had one small flare for just a few days, then progressed steadily. I had<BR>
a colonoscopy one year later (one month ago) the results showed no sign of<BR>
any bowel disease, healthy and wide open. I was advised to come back in two<BR>
or three years, unless I have a flare. (He wasn't the least interested in<BR>
my starch free diet.) The last few months I have gained my regular energy<BR>
back, and I don't know how or why. I can't think of any large changes I may<BR>
have made in my diet. I cut back or(I dont need) as much honey now as used<BR>
earlier.<BR>
I will stay on the diet for the rest of my days. The diet is now my life<BR>
style. I wont return to the foods that make me ill. There is no secret to<BR>
this diet.  It is after all nothing but simply healthy food.<BR>
So why in the world would I to leave it? <BR>
I hope this post will bring some encouragement to those who struggle to<BR>
free themselves from the ravages of bowel disease.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck in your search for good health.<BR>

Yuca is a tuber, similar to the potato. It is popular in central america.<BR>
Just like you can make potato flour, you can make yuca flour. My guess is<BR>
that it is not suitable for the diet.<BR>

Dear Group,<BR>
Elaine faxed the following message for me to send to you;<BR>
<BR>
To SCD group,<BR>
Wanted to share the following information with you;<BR>
<BR>
(1) Received a letter from a woman in PA which again confirms the fact that<BR>
SCD is very often effective in the most serious neurological problems. If<BR>
you refer to page 60 in the Breaking the Vicious Cycle, you should see the<BR>
relationship between what the mainstream research has found out about<BR>
erratic behavior and intestinal fermentation.<BR>
<BR>
Dear Mrs. Gottschall,<BR>
In Jan. our son was diagnosed as having borderline/level/Tourette Syndrome.<BR>
Our brother-in-law with Crohn's disease is on the diet and is very excited<BR>
about the good results. He showed us a video and you talked about the diet<BR>
and how it helped some people with neurological problems.<BR>
It took a month or more until we could possibly say we saw improvement.<BR>
Ever since, he has been definately better, with setbacks after being sick<BR>
or when he cheated. Thanks for all the information you have provided<BR>
through your books and tapes. We are very grateful.<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
RS(did not get permission to use her name)<BR>
<BR>
I am so thrilled to get this feedback - imagine! Toureete's Syndrome is<BR>
another one starting in the intestine!<BR>
<BR>
(2) A wonderful lady in Denmark (Mik &amp; she have been in touch) was<BR>
scheduled for surgery for UC and went on the diet and the doctor cancelled<BR>
the surgery and she is wonderful. She contacted me and told me she was<BR>
translating the book into Danish. We have done a lot of faxing about<BR>
ingredients which may or may not be available in Denmark and now are on the<BR>
brink of getting a Danish publisher.<BR>
She has been interveiwed on radio and is scheduled for a magazine interveiw<BR>
which will reach 1/2 million people. Her doctor is thrilled and is going to<BR>
use the diet for his celiac patients. I just sent him the history of celiac<BR>
which I wrote and which Mik put on his website.<BR>
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get this kind of support in North America?<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

I have one of those also.  I use either the Dannon plain yogurt (comes in<BR>
16 oz. size and I use half for a batch) or I use the Yogourmet Starter,<BR>
according to directions.  I guess you'd have to order that through your<BR>
health food store.<BR>

Hi everybody!<BR>
<BR>
Some days ago I sendt mail to both SCD-lists and IBDList about the cause of<BR>
CD. I know that this was somewhat distance from the purpose of this list,<BR>
but I just had to tell you! Now some thoughts about SCD and Cromium. A<BR>
&quot;diet&quot; high in refined suger will not only be low in Cromium but will also<BR>
inhibit the absorbtion of cromium in the gut! Typical food with much cromium<BR>
are: Meat, shellfish and chicken. The less refined food the better. Therefor<BR>
SCD probably will give you enough cromium. And as many of you have noticed,<BR>
SCD is able to stop the inflammation in the gut for quite a few people.<BR>
Therefor I believe that for some people SCD can cure CD.=20<BR>

Hi Ellen,<BR>
<BR>
U.S. Dept. of Agriculture scientists recently designed the best diets they<BR>
could think of; yet the most chromium in the &quot;super diets&quot; was still a mere<BR>
24 micrograms per 1,000 calories.  Foods high in chromium are brewer's<BR>
yeast, broccoli, barley, liver, lobster tail, shrimp, whole grains,<BR>
mudshrooms and some brands of beer; due to contamination durng processing.<BR>
However, much chromium in food is not well absorbed!  Message:  Don't<BR>
depend on food for chromium, especially if you're on this diet!  Instead,<BR>
take 200 mcg. daily of chromium picolate.  This info on page 88 of &quot;Stop<BR>
Aging Now.&quot; Author, Jean Carper.<BR>

Thank you, William! I've been on the diet 1 1/2 years, and am symptom<BR>
free.  Last night I went to a Mexican restaurant, and had re-fried bean,<BR>
which I'm sure are &quot;cheating, as well as their salsa and a Dos Equis<BR>
beer!  I feel that it hasn't adversely affected me.  I was wondering in,<BR>
cummulatively, I would sink into sickness again if I kept up this<BR>
behaviour.  I can see from your post that there is a very good chance of<BR>
this happening, so I guess I'll stick to the diet 100% for a while<BR>
longer (I guess the rest of my life!!).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for saving me the trouble of getting sick again!<BR>

&gt; the Group<BR>
&gt; (I have tried to keep this short.)<BR>
&gt; It is great to see as many postings that have been showing up on the<BR>
&gt; SCD<BR>
&gt; list the last few months. While I have not been active  in  postings<BR>
&gt; for<BR>
&gt; some time, certainly the subjects  appearing on the list continue to<BR>
&gt; hold<BR>
&gt; my interest.<BR>
&gt;  However I must plead guilty of receiving more benefits from this list<BR>
&gt; than<BR>
&gt;  having returned in the way of postings of encouragement to the new<BR>
&gt; comers<BR>
&gt; who are desperately in need of  help to expel their fears, as well to<BR>
&gt; offer<BR>
&gt; assistance with this diet. If my memory serves me correctly  there are<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; others like myself, after becoming stable on the SCD diet find  all<BR>
&gt; too<BR>
&gt; convenient to quietly slip away.   So then for those on the list, who<BR>
&gt; have<BR>
&gt; nothing but fears and questions, may I relate this success story for<BR>
&gt; you of<BR>
&gt; how the SCD turned my life around and made live worthwhile again.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Fifteen years  ago I found myself bleeding from the rectum, so<BR>
&gt; severely I<BR>
&gt; was forced to empty the colon approx. every twenty minutes.  I was of<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; opinion I suffered from  bleeding internal hemorrhoids  in the lower<BR>
&gt; colon.<BR>
&gt;  Our family doctor advised me to make an  appointment with a Doctor<BR>
&gt; who<BR>
&gt; specialized in problems of the bowel. After the  examination I was<BR>
&gt; shocked<BR>
&gt; when the Doctor stated =93Good news - you do not have Cancer. But you d=<BR>
o<BR>
&gt; have<BR>
&gt; Ulcerative Colitis, and that may or may not contribute to cancer of<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; bowel.=94  Frightening words for a man who would all but faint when a<BR>
&gt; nurse<BR>
&gt; drew blood from his arm.  How shall I cure this disease Doctor? =93<BR>
&gt; There is<BR>
&gt; no known cure.=94 I will venture everyone on this list has a similar<BR>
&gt; story.<BR>
&gt; After finding this list in its early days it was comforting to learn<BR>
&gt; there<BR>
&gt; was a place where the problems of IBD could be discussed openly.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I started the diet in mar. 1993, failed it after three weeks, then<BR>
&gt; tried<BR>
&gt; the second time. By the end of the same year the colon was well on its<BR>
&gt; way<BR>
&gt; to full recovery. I was symptom free with no flares for well more than<BR>
&gt; two<BR>
&gt; years. I used medications for only the first month during that period.<BR>
&gt; I<BR>
&gt; made the yogurt, stuck to the book, although I never did do any<BR>
&gt; baking, and<BR>
&gt; still dont. Chopped, fresh or frozen mixed veggies and fruit. I can<BR>
&gt; eat<BR>
&gt; apples, oranges, bananas by the bushel. I started with small amounts<BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; fish, chicken, scrambled eggs, beef and very crisp bacon later on in<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; diet I drank very weak coffee black. My colon appeared to have<BR>
&gt; recovered<BR>
&gt; completely. I felt so improved, health wise after two and some half<BR>
&gt; years<BR>
&gt; with no flares, that I decided I could now go back to eating some<BR>
&gt; starch on<BR>
&gt; a limited basis. That was a serious mistake. Within six to eight<BR>
&gt; months I<BR>
&gt; was bleeding from the colon, with  severe pains in both sides, to the<BR>
&gt; extent I could not lie on either side in bed at night. I lost all the<BR>
&gt; weight I had gained in the previous two years.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; In July of 1996 I was able to view my colon on closed circuit TV while<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; having a  sigmoidoscopy.<BR>
&gt; The inflammation was limited to approx. half way around a cross<BR>
&gt; section and<BR>
&gt; 12 inches (30cm) long. This damage resulted in approx. 6 to eight<BR>
&gt; months<BR>
&gt; from allowing  limited starch in my diet. I went back on Medication<BR>
&gt; for two<BR>
&gt; weeks until the bleeding stopped, also started back full time on the<BR>
&gt; diet.<BR>
&gt; I had one small flare for just a few days, then progressed steadily. I<BR>
&gt; had<BR>
&gt; a colonoscopy one year later (one month ago) the results showed no<BR>
&gt; sign of<BR>
&gt; any bowel disease, healthy and wide open. I was advised to come back<BR>
&gt; in two<BR>
&gt; or three years, unless I have a flare. (He wasn=92t the least intereste=<BR>
d<BR>
&gt; in<BR>
&gt; my starch free diet.) The last few months I have gained my regular<BR>
&gt; energy<BR>
&gt; back, and I don=92t know how or why. I can=92t think of any large chang=<BR>
es<BR>
&gt; I may<BR>
&gt; have made in my diet. I cut back or(I dont need) as much honey now as<BR>
&gt; used<BR>
&gt; earlier.<BR>
&gt; I will stay on the diet for the rest of my days. The diet is now my<BR>
&gt; life<BR>
&gt; style. I wont return to the foods that make me ill. There is no secret<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; this diet.  It is after all nothing but simply healthy food.<BR>
&gt; So why in the world would I to leave it?<BR>
&gt; I hope this post will bring some encouragement to those who struggle<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; free themselves from the ravages of bowel disease.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Good luck in your search for good health.<BR>

I had the exact same problem you did - what am i going to do for carbos? of<BR>
all the foods that exist, i can give up every one of them except for my<BR>
carbos! My BEST advice to you is to invest in the almond flour if you already<BR>
havent done so. Also, order the dry curd cottage cheese and make Lois Langs<BR>
Luscious Bread. This bread can also be toasted. It can also be dipped in egg<BR>
and a french toast made with almond butter as your spread.<BR>
<BR>
So, with the bread you can have chicken sandwiches and the like. There HAS to<BR>
be some way you can take this almond flour and with the right ingredients and<BR>
consistency, spread on a cookie sheet and baked until crisp so that we can<BR>
break apart and serve as a cereal. I havent gotten that far to experiment but<BR>
it has to be possible. so for breakfast, i guess the choices are, french<BR>
toast with almond butter, muffins, eggs and toast, yogurt and fruit (bananas,<BR>
yogurt and almond butter are good - layer and freeze, thaw 30 minutes before<BR>
eating), or milkshakes. See recipe in book. Stay away from ALL grains - this<BR>
is the #2 rule of Elaines. This includes millet. you will find when you feel<BR>
better, the diet is worth it.<BR>

I thought I might clairify my position on using grains.  I think its not<BR>
the best idea, but at this point, it seems to be a good option for me.<BR>
I've never been one to obey rules anyway.  My plans are to return to the<BR>
diet at some point, when I can tolerate some more of the staples (a<BR>
month or two?).<BR>
<BR>
Its important for many people to ease into these dietary changes,<BR>
especially when they are not that sick.  Once an emergency is over, you<BR>
can usually convince yourself it isn't that bad, so why go through all<BR>
the hell of a diet?  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has thought<BR>
this.  Its just not possible for some people to handle the emotional end<BR>
of the diet -- at least on the first try.  I know that if I was Liz, I'd<BR>
have a hard time giving up the rice and potatoes.  It took me three<BR>
years to mentally prepare myself for a diet as strict as the SCD.  I<BR>
still wasn't emotionally ready since I fell off the diet after 2 months<BR>
(and paid the price).I guess I want to say that even though millet and<BR>
buckwheat (this isn't a grain anyway is it?) have been working for me, I<BR>
don't recommend it before giving the SCD &quot;the 'ole college try.&quot;  SCD<BR>
with limited, special grains, is much better than the typical &quot;healthy&quot;<BR>
diet of wheat bread sandwiches, wheat and corn based cereals, pasta,<BR>
rice, and plain baked potatoes -- In other words, a heavy hitting starch<BR>
for every meal.  This healthy diet is probably what got me here in the<BR>
first place.<BR>

I joined this list a few days ago -- what a find! (Can I get a digest <BR>
version? I tried &quot;set digest&quot; to no avail.) I'm the only person I know <BR>
on this diet (on since last Christmas), so it's really nice to talk to <BR>
you guys.  I tell my friends that I'm on the Woody Allen &quot;Sleeper&quot; diet <BR>
-- I can have bacon and eggs, but no whole wheat bread!  Actually, I <BR>
usually prefer not to engage in discussion of my strange new eating <BR>
habits, but cannot always avoid it.  Just saying no when people offer me <BR>
food usually works, but not always. What do other people say gracefully?<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I saw the cheese crisps idea, and tried it with herbs, and loved <BR>
it.  So simple! <BR>
<BR>
I have a cheese snack recipe that works with almond flour, that two <BR>
regular eaters asked me for -- it's good, though a little greasy.  I <BR>
picked up a tip from this list already, to add less oil when using <BR>
almond flour, and I will try that next time. Here is the recipe with its <BR>
full oil allotment:<BR>
<BR>
Cheese snacks      350 degrees for 15 minutes<BR>
<BR>
1/4 pound shredded cheddar cheese<BR>
1 cup almond flour<BR>
1/2 teaspoon salt<BR>
1/4 teaspoon sage (or fresh sage)<BR>
1/4 teaspoon thyme (or fresh thyme)<BR>
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (really makes it good)<BR>
1/4 cup vegetable oil (you may try reducing this)<BR>
3 tbsp. cold water<BR>
coarse salt, sesame seeds or poppy seeds<BR>
<BR>
Add flour, salt, sage, thyme and cayenne pepper to cheese.  Mix.<BR>
<BR>
Add oil and water to cheese mixture.  Mix.  Form into a ball and <BR>
refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
(Roll dough on a lightly powdered smooth flat surface.  Sprinkle with <BR>
your choice of salt or seeds, and lightly roll in.)*<BR>
<BR>
Cut into one 1/2 inch squares and place on cookie sheet.  Bake 15 <BR>
minutes at 350 degrees.  Cool.  Makes two dozen crackers.<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
*I put this in parentheses, because although it's a good idea, it makes <BR>
for much more stuff to clean up, and it's not essential.  I've taken to <BR>
just forming small squares and going directly from the bowl to the <BR>
cookie sheet. Then I sprinkle the sesame seeds, which add a lot to the <BR>
texture of the cheese snacks.<BR>

yes, buckwheat is a grain and an acidic one at that. since the diet is a<BR>
specific one, we need to stay in the parameters. since your not fixed yet<BR>
(sorry), i knew i was telling her right by staying off of all grains. the<BR>
body doesnt know one grain from another and if we want to heal the gut and<BR>
grains are causing problems, the body knows when we take it ALL away that it<BR>
isnt getting the very things that irritate it.<BR>
<BR>
yes, wanting to be well is a committment. some people have time to waste. i<BR>
dont. its everyones individual decision and committment but in case Liz was<BR>
committed, she needed to know what was real and since this is about the<BR>
specific carbohydrate diet, eventually it wont be if we give advice straying<BR>
away from the very content. <BR>

Message-ID: &lt;19971004131221.15454.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi,<BR>
<BR>
To help my CD I want to try SCD without diary. This requires me to try <BR>
to get the &quot;good bacteria&quot; in other ways than the yoghurt. I got the <BR>
following recommendation from a German doctor for a therapy based on <BR>
massive amounts of &quot;good bacteria&quot;:<BR>
<BR>
Phase 1 (1 month):<BR>
  Pro-Symbioflor: Start at 2x1 drop a day and increase gradually to<BR>
    2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Lacto and Bifido (eg. SymbioLact Comp): 2 times a day <BR>
    5E8 Lactobacillus-acidophilus and 5E8 Lactobacillus-casei and <BR>
    5E8 Bifidobacterium bifidum soluted in a glass of water.<BR>
<BR>
Phase 2 (5 months):<BR>
  Pro-Symbioflor: 2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Symbioflor 1: 2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Lacto and Bifido (eg. SymbioLact Comp): 2 times a day <BR>
    5E8 Lactobacillus-acidophilus and 5E8 Lactobacillus-casei and <BR>
    5E8 Bifidobacterium bifidum soluted in a glass of water.<BR>
<BR>
Phase 3 (6 months):<BR>
  Symbioflor 1: 2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Symbioflor 2: Start at 2x1 drop a day and increase to <BR>
    2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Lacto and Bifido (eg. SymbioLact Comp): 2 times a day <BR>
    5E8 Lactobacillus-acidophilus and 5E8 Lactobacillus-casei and <BR>
    5E8 Bifidobacterium bifidum soluted in a glass of water.<BR>
<BR>
Now this looks fine, but where do I buy this stuff:<BR>
<BR>
  Pro-Symbioflor<BR>
  Symbioflor 1<BR>
  Symbioflor 2<BR>
  SymbioLact Comp<BR>
<BR>
I am in Denmark, but I guess mail order from anywhere in Europe would be <BR>
economically okay. Maybe even from the states.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance,<BR>
<BR>
Kurt<BR>

I know this subject has been discussed before, but I was hoping someone<BR>
knows which beans are allowed on the SCD diet. The book says that dried<BR>
white beans and lentils are allowed, and that soybeans, mungbeans, faba<BR>
beans, and garbanzo beans are forbidden. What about all the others: kidney<BR>
beans, pinto beans, etc.?<BR>
<BR>
thanks,<BR>

In a message dated 97-10-03 23:29:29 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; yes, buckwheat is a grain and an acidic one at that. &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Actually, buckwheat is not a grain as is commonly thought.  It is an herb.<BR>
