&gt;Hi Everyone,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm visiting family in Dallas-Ft. Worth area during Christmas holidays and<BR>
&gt;am wondering if there is anyone on the SCD list who lives in that area and<BR>
&gt;can tell me if you are able to find DCCC there and where if so.<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I was playing around with the cracker recipe this evening which I <BR>
absolutely love.  I added some minced red pepper to the mix and it turned <BR>
out great. Does anyone have other suggestion for making a variety of <BR>
cracker flavours that you use? I would love to hear them.<BR>
<BR>
To the cracker recipe I cut the oil in half ( 1/8 cup ) and used the <BR>
toaster oven at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  The grilled red peppers I <BR>
made before the mix as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Mince 1/2 small red pepper.  <BR>
Spread evenly on a baking sheet. <BR>
Brush with olive oil and roast in the oven at 250 for 1 hour, or until <BR>
dried.<BR>
Add to cracker mix and blend. <BR>
Bake as per recipe.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
All,<BR>
<BR>
With the holiday season upon us, I 've been thinking about the foods we<BR>
ordinarily eat at this time of year. Having been on the diet for about 5<BR>
months, this will be the first holiday season that our diet has been at all<BR>
restricted.<BR>
<BR>
The thing that actually prompted this message will probably not be of much<BR>
concern to many on the list. However, those who hail from south of the<BR>
Mason/Dixon line (as do I) may have thought about this already. The food I<BR>
am referring to is blackeyed peas. They are good at any time of year, but<BR>
are especially important at new year's. Supposedly, you need to eat them to<BR>
bring good luck in the comming 12 months. Now I know it's just a<BR>
superstition, but it's one I have always enjoyed... especially since I live<BR>
outside of the south. Whenever we have people over at new year's, I make<BR>
sure they get their dose. The question is: are they an allowable legume?<BR>
<BR>
The next thing is cranberry sauce. does anyone have a killer recipe for SCD<BR>
cranberry sauce? My guess is: yes. Maybe you would like to share it.<BR>
<BR>
Next item: Stuffing. I'm figuring that almond bread would probably do<BR>
nicely. Has any one tried it?<BR>
<BR>
Yam's seems like an easy one. Mashed butternut squash should fill the gap<BR>
quite well.<BR>
<BR>
And now, after all those questions here's one suggestion. In Texas it was<BR>
always tradition at my house to have parched pecans. If you try this, it<BR>
may become tradition at yours. Melt a half a stick of butter, put pecans<BR>
into pan and ,coat them with butter add salt to taste, Spread pecans on a<BR>
cookie sheet, and put them into the oven on high. cook them until they are<BR>
dark and toasty.<BR>

I dont know what other problems your friend is having, but if he is getting<BR>
sick or in the detox process, nausea is usually due to liver overload. the<BR>
liver would need to be cleaned and will be as he cleanses<BR>

When I was pregnant, I started out in remission but into my third month the<BR>
disease flared up. I was not on the SCD and was sick and in great pain for<BR>
the duration. After the birth I got seriously ill and had to go back on the<BR>
steroids and stop nursing. I ate noodles and tofu, thinking it would make me<BR>
better but my stomach was constantly in agony. If only I had known about the<BR>
diet, I am sure none of that would have happened.<BR>
<BR>
Some people maintain the remission and some people don't. I am sure that if<BR>
you stick to the diet, you will have an easier time than I did.<BR>

In the list of cheeses permitted occasionally, if one doesn't react badly to<BR>

I would like any general information about Crohns, what are the symptoms, etc.<BR>
<BR>
My son has intestinal dysbiosis but is it Crohns, how would I know?<BR>
<BR>
There IS research in the UK linking Crohns to the MMR vaccine. The virus<BR>
from the vaccine gets into the lymph nodes of the colon and produces Crohns.<BR>
<BR>
Also, any information from list members on how they overcame Crohns would be<BR>
helpful.<BR>

Dear Rosa,<BR>
I think no-one may have taken on this question because it really is a<BR>
personal decision. &quot;Occasionally&quot; is a fairly broad term and to me it would<BR>
mean &quot;caution advised&quot;. How have you been using that term? Give me more<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt; <BR>
 Regarding Kombucha tea, I've read some warnings about it, just FYI:<BR>
 4/24/95 Newsweek - one death and one illness in Iowa from (suspected)<BR>
 batch of contaminated Kombucha (homemade). According to some info I<BR>
 received from Candida &amp; Intestinal Dybiosis Foundation, if you are having<BR>
 health problems, it's best to consume only commercially controlled<BR>
 Kombucha products. Hope this is helpful and not too scary.<BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Stacia,<BR>
<BR>
My mother and grandmother have been drinking Kambucha on and off for a couple<BR>
of years.  We have a few books on it.  It sounds like a remarkable thing, but<BR>
now it gives me gas and indigestion.  Since I have a compromised GI system, I<BR>
stay away from anything that doesn't agree with me.  However I used to drink<BR>
it with no problem as little as a few months ago.  I just got bored of it and<BR>
stopped.  When my CD symptoms got somewhat bad, a lot of things no longer<BR>
agreed with me.<BR>
<BR>
As far as drinking commercial kambusha, you are taking the same chance as<BR>
eating commercial yogurt.  The kambucha has to be kept completely clean and<BR>
free of airborne particles, bugs, pollen, etc.  The death incident you<BR>
mentioned was not determined that it was caused by the kamucha.  The poor<BR>
mushroom was just a scapegoat that sent a frenzy against it.  It didn't kill<BR>
anyone, but it can make you sick if you don't keep it covered and clean.<BR>
 Just like food.  IF you don't refrigerate it and take care of it the way it<BR>
is required to, anyone can get sick from spoiled food.<BR>
<BR>
I personally WOULD not trust commercial kambucha unless I visited the farm<BR>
and observed the way they make it, grow it, and bottle it.  It is FAR better<BR>
to grow it yourself if you really want to drink it.  And follow the caring<BR>
instructions  very carefully.  If it was a dangerous plant, my family<BR>
would've gotten sick a long time ago.  Instead, they are full of<BR>
energy.....everyone except me.<BR>
<BR>
I wish you the best in what ever decision you make.<BR>

Anne and all,<BR>
<BR>
This recipe floated by here last October from Mary, I believe!<BR>
<BR>
Cheese snacks      350 degrees for 15 minutes<BR>
<BR>
1/4 pound shredded cheddar cheese<BR>
1 cup almond flour<BR>
1/2 teaspoon salt<BR>
1/4 teaspoon sage (or fresh sage)<BR>
1/4 teaspoon thyme (or fresh thyme)<BR>
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (really makes it good)<BR>
1/4 cup vegetable oil (you may try reducing this)<BR>
3 tbsp. cold water<BR>
coarse salt, sesame seeds or poppy seeds<BR>
<BR>
Add flour, salt, sage, thyme and cayenne pepper to <BR>
cheese.  Mix.<BR>
<BR>
Add oil and water to cheese mixture.  Mix.  Form into a ball and <BR>
refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
(Roll dough on a lightly powdered smooth flat surface.  Sprinkle with <BR>
your choice of salt or seeds, and lightly roll in.)*<BR>
<BR>
Cut into one 1/2 inch squares and place on cookie sheet.  Bake 15 <BR>
minutes at 350 degrees.  Cool.  Makes two dozen crackers.<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
*I put this in parentheses, because although it's a <BR>
good idea, it makes for much more stuff to clean up, and it's not <BR>
essential.  I've taken to just forming small squares and going directly from <BR>
the bowl to the cookie sheet. Then I sprinkle the sesame seeds, <BR>
which add a lot to the texture of the cheese snacks.<BR>

So would I!  Yesterday, I made my monthly visit to my Network Chiro; showed<BR>
her a copy of Kurt's post re above...she responded that the Nature's<BR>
Biotics which I am taking is not for the same purpose as she believes the<BR>
above is...to restore the natural flora balance; but rather Nature's<BR>
Biotics is to cleanse the intestines.  So, it seems we need one to restore<BR>
flora, one to cleanse and... one to tonify!  She recommended a traditional<BR>
Chinese Botanical which is made of Dong Quai Root and Rhubarb Root to bring<BR>
chi to the colon; it is non-purgative, non-cathartic and is often used for<BR>
travelers.  Anyone know about this?  I am particularly interested to learn<BR>
if roots (these) and others, have starch in them?  or unallowed carbs?<BR>

Also, can you furnish the ingredients of the Pro Symbioflor and SymbioLact<BR>
Comp?<BR>

Abdominal tuberculosis is not uncommon in the UK, especially in Asian immigrants. It resembles<BR>
Crohn's disease clinically and radiologically, and it may be difficult to differentiate between them,<BR>
even at laparotomy or histology. The distinction is important, however, for proper management of the<BR>
two conditions. Every effort must be made to exclude abdominal tuberculosis before the patient is<BR>
diagnosed as having Crohn's disease and is treated with steroids. <BR>

1.5g carbohydrate isn't saying much.  The actual type of carbohydrates is<BR>
what is important.  <BR>
<BR>
Why on earth do you need a protein powder when on the SCD?  Are you<BR>
following a vegetarian version?  Most of us are probably getting 2-3 times<BR>
the amount that a normal person would consume.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
This is a clip from an article from the CCFA. I've only clipped a small<BR>
part, because I didn't want to risk infringing on anyones copyright.<BR>
Severly so - anyway :<BR>
<BR>
&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;<BR>
The first two parts of this series dealt with 1997 grants in the areas<BR>
of immunology and genetics. This final section involves just one new<BR>
grant. However, its subject -- Mycobacterium paratuberculosis -- has<BR>
been causing a stir since 1913.<BR>
<BR>
It was in that year that a Glasgow surgeon, Dr. Dalziel, published a<BR>
paper describing the illness that eventually became known as Crohn's<BR>
disease. Dr. Dalziel believed Crohn's to originate from bacterium known<BR>
as Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. This bacterium causes intestinal<BR>
tuberculosis and paratuberculosis, diseases with similar symptoms to<BR>
Crohn's. But Dr. Dalziel could not prove this connection. In 1932,<BR>
Burrill B. Crohn and his coinvestigators, the first to document Crohn's<BR>
disease, also could not find a bacterial origin.<BR>
&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;<BR>
<BR>
The article goes on at length about research done and research needed<BR>
and deosn't really conclude didely.<BR>
If anyone knows were one can get ones hands on the *results* of those<BR>
researches (there must me something out there ?), then I for one would<BR>
be very interested.<BR>
<BR>
You see - my dad had what they call *an encapsulated tuberculosis*.<BR>
Which cann't be treated convetionally and surgery (was back then)<BR>
supposed to be too dangerous. On the other hand an encapsulated<BR>
tuberculosis wasn't (isn't) supposed to be contagious.<BR>
<BR>
But I remember being screened for lung tuberculosis - I think it was<BR>
about every other year. So somebody wanted to be on the safe side....<BR>
<BR>
Nowadays I cann't help wondering whether a lung tuberculosis can migrate<BR>
to the intestines ?<BR>

My son has a lot of tactile issues. He has improved, no longer jumps when<BR>
you touch him, still it is painful for him to have you touch his head.<BR>
<BR>
Would this be a bacterial issue, a candida issue, or what?<BR>
<BR>
Also, he simply lacks the life of other children. He is not so much autistic<BR>
as simply sick, with what I do not know. He has a pallor about him. He was<BR>
on antibiotics for a long time for ear infections, which turned out to be a<BR>
milk allergy.<BR>
<BR>
On the SCD diet, the diarrhea is gone. He had alternating bouts of diarrhea<BR>
and by diarrhea I mean you would find a sticky mess in his pants, not a<BR>
runny diarrhea. He had trouble controlling his bowels, now this problem is gone.<BR>
<BR>
So wouldn't this alone, mean he is absorbing at least some nutrients better,<BR>
now that the diarrhea has stopped? <BR>
<BR>
How would I know if he has Crohns, what are the symptoms? I have never seen<BR>
a bloody stool, but then he is kind of private about the stools!<BR>
<BR>
So, I feel the SCD diet is benefitting him in halting the diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
I have not noticed more energy yet on the SCD diet, will this come? <BR>
<BR>
Also, the SCD diet seems (I could be wrong here) to be against using<BR>
supplements like Olive Leaf Extract, Soil Based Organisms, and so forth.<BR>
Some of the parents of autistic kids are reporting success with the above two.<BR>
<BR>
I have him on a totally natural SCD diet. I have been giving very small<BR>
amounts of raw garlic to discourage fungus.<BR>
<BR>
I have also not been giving him much fruit.<BR>
<BR>
He can eat a ton of food, what is happening to it????? <BR>
<BR>
A typical meal would be a Romaine salad with no dressing, some raw yellow<BR>
peppers, a turkey burger, some winter squash with butter on it, and a<BR>
zucchini muffin for dessert. He can eat all of this and more and then will<BR>
still say, &quot;I am hungry.&quot; This hunger was NOT there when he was on carbos<BR>
such as rice bread, potatoes, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Any ideas on how to get some weight on him? And some color?<BR>
<BR>
I am also giving a multivitamin which sometimes makes him flush, I think due<BR>
to the niacin. Also, am giving calcium lactate pills, as well as friendly<BR>
bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to start the dry curd cheese, have not started due to his<BR>
former dairy allergy. Am planning to try the cheesecake recipe with much<BR>
smaller amounts of honey.<BR>
<BR>
If anyone has any ideas, I would appreciate it!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

I can just imagine how hard you are working at this.  My 2 cents about kids,<BR>
candida, and milk allergies. Most of my kids have milk allergies and showed<BR>
different reactions to it from bed wetting to stomach pains and diarrhea.<BR>
They are dairy free, but when I went on the SCD, I tried giving them the<BR>
allowable cheeses and they seem to be doing fine with them (2 weeks).  Also,<BR>
there are a lot of calories here and the cheese is filling (DCCC custard is a<BR>
big hit).  They also like the granola (lots of calories) which brings up the<BR>
candida and the fruit issue.  I have candida and now eat all the fruit I want<BR>
and I'm getting lots better.  I personally believe its better to &quot;let go&quot; of<BR>
past learned behaviors from other diets and just strictly follow the scd<BR>
(including your other supplements).  But, as I'm sure you do, just introduce<BR>
each new food group (cheese, fruit and honey) separately.  My kids are much<BR>
more satisfied with fruit and honey treats which may fill the carbo void your<BR>
son feels.  They fill them up and add calories between meals (which one of<BR>
mine really needs also).  Elaine says this diet takes care of candida so I<BR>
would do everything on this diet and try not to avoid any of the foods unless<BR>
there is a difinite reaction to it.  Take care of yourself too!  Jane<BR>

Is bentonite allowed on the SCD diet?<BR>
<BR>
It is a cleanser to move dead yeast and other toxins  out of the body.<BR>
<BR>
Are colon irrigations allowed, water only.<BR>

Hi Paula,<BR>
<BR>
&gt;   Does anyone know if a protein powder made from whey peptides ....<BR>
<BR>
I don't have the book with me, however I am certain that the key word<BR>
*whey* is a no-no on the diet.  I believe it is a variation of<BR>
wheat (or lactose).<BR>

search your local health food store.  I use a brand called<BR>

Simone:<BR>
&gt;For those of you suffering from diarrhea, someone told me about a Japanese<BR>
&gt;tea called Morning Tea.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;It contains KUZU, BANCHA TEA, and GINGER.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;A lady who had cured herself of CD 16 years ago told me about it, and who to<BR>
&gt;ask for the recipe.  She was on the macrobiotic diet and herbal supplemets,<BR>
&gt;and the lady who gave me the recipe for the tea is a macrobiotic specialist<BR>
&gt; (I am still loyal to SCD).  She told me that the tea should give me a<BR>
&gt;regular BM, and to stop drinking it as soon as the BM is back to normal as<BR>
&gt;the body may become depended on it.  It should not be drunk for more than one<BR>
&gt;month, and the time it takes for it to work differs from person to person.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Has anyone heard of this tea and used it?<BR>
<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
Kuzu I believe is also Kudzu. It's a white starchy root and it definitely<BR>
binds the system. However, with IBD the starch might exacerbate<BR>
inflammation! It is macro and I've heard it used for diarrhea with<BR>
umebeoshi plum and miso.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;has anyone heard or used Sweedish<BR>
&gt;Bitters?<BR>
<BR>
SS<BR>
I believe the health food stores have 2 kinds of bitters one of which is<BR>
called Swedish Bitters. The bitters help digestion plus have many other<BR>
properties. Christopher Hobbs in his book The Foundations of Health, A<BR>
Liver and Digestive Herbal, gets into bitters and has an excellent formula<BR>
one can make at home.<BR>

&gt;Hi Everyone, That Split Pea Soup does sound good! I was hoping to find the<BR>
&gt;recipe for it in Elaine's Book. Anyone have a recipe for this that they would<BR>
&gt;like to pass on to the group? Thanks..JoEllen<BR>
<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
Hi...A friend passed this on to me and I modified it to my taste. I like<BR>
some of it raw.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
SPLIT PEA AND SPINACH SOUP<BR>
<BR>
2 cups chopped onions (2-3 cups)<BR>
1 cup diced carrots (1-2 cups)<BR>
1 TBS chopped garlic (1-5 cloves of garlic)<BR>
2 anaheim chiles chopped (1-3 chiles)<BR>
2 cups green split peas, sorted and rinsed<BR>
9 cups water or vegetable stock<BR>
2 10 oz bags of baby spinach leaves (or what is available)<BR>
1 TBS lemon juice<BR>
1-2 TBS sea salt<BR>
<BR>
Set aside 1/3 to 1/2 of chopped vegetables to add back raw later.<BR>
<BR>
In a Dutch oven or 4 quart saucepan, combine the onions, carrots, garlic,<BR>
chiles, split peas, salt, and water or vegetable stock. Raise the heat to<BR>
medium high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low, cover the<BR>
pot, and cook for 2 hours or until peas are tender and the soup is thick.<BR>
<BR>
Remove from the heat. Add lemon juice, remainder of raw vegetables, and 1<BR>
bag of baby spinach leaves. Stir until spinach leaves are wilted and<BR>
blended in the soup. Add the second bag of spinach leaves and stir until<BR>
they are blended in the soup. Sample for desired amount of salt. Adjust.<BR>
<BR>
Transfer about 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup to a blender or food processor and<BR>
process until smooth. Pour back into the pot. Soup is ready to go.<BR>
<BR>
I changed the original recipe because I like part of it raw. I increased<BR>
the amounts of the vegetables. See amounts in parentheses. Use your own<BR>
judgment on quantities of vegetables.<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Hi,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;This is a clip from an article from the CCFA. I've only clipped a small<BR>
&gt;part, because I didn't want to risk infringing on anyones copyright.<BR>
&gt;Severly so - anyway :<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;<BR>
&gt;The first two parts of this series dealt with 1997 grants in the areas<BR>
&gt;of immunology and genetics. This final section involves just one new<BR>
&gt;grant. However, its subject -- Mycobacterium paratuberculosis -- has<BR>
&gt;been causing a stir since 1913.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;It was in that year that a Glasgow surgeon, Dr. Dalziel, published a<BR>
&gt;paper describing the illness that eventually became known as Crohn's<BR>
&gt;disease. Dr. Dalziel believed Crohn's to originate from bacterium known<BR>
&gt;as Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. This bacterium causes intestinal<BR>
&gt;tuberculosis and paratuberculosis, diseases with similar symptoms to<BR>
&gt;Crohn's. But Dr. Dalziel could not prove this connection. In 1932,<BR>
&gt;Burrill B. Crohn and his coinvestigators, the first to document Crohn's<BR>
&gt;disease, also could not find a bacterial origin.<BR>
&gt;&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The article goes on at length about research done and research needed<BR>
&gt;and deosn't really conclude didely.<BR>
&gt;If anyone knows were one can get ones hands on the *results* of those<BR>
&gt;researches (there must me something out there ?), then I for one would<BR>
&gt;be very interested.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You see - my dad had what they call *an encapsulated tuberculosis*.<BR>
&gt;Which cann't be treated convetionally and surgery (was back then)<BR>
&gt;supposed to be too dangerous. On the other hand an encapsulated<BR>
&gt;tuberculosis wasn't (isn't) supposed to be contagious.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;But I remember being screened for lung tuberculosis - I think it was<BR>
&gt;about every other year. So somebody wanted to be on the safe side....<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Nowadays I cann't help wondering whether a lung tuberculosis can migrate<BR>
&gt;to the intestines ?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I'm not a pathologist, but I recently looked up tuberculosis in my<BR>
pathology text because it's been in the news lately; it said that<BR>
tuberculosis can affect virtually any part of the body, not just the lungs<BR>
as we largely think of it.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, just to make sure I just looked it up again; &quot;Mycobacterium<BR>
tuberculosis&quot; is the bacillus that causes it, it IS infectious, causes<BR>
inflammatory inflitrations, abscesses, etc.  Most common in respir. system,<BR>
but other parts such as GASTROINTESTINAL &amp; GENITOURINARY TRACTS (my<BR>
emphasis), bones, joints, nervous system, lymph nodes &amp; skin may become<BR>
infected. jThree types exist: human, avian, and bovine (it's very common in<BR>
cows, by which I'm presuming they mean amongst &quot;normal&quot; penned cows that<BR>
are not allowed to graze freely on rangeland but &quot;live&quot; on these huge<BR>
feedlots where they can hardly move &amp; are basically forcefed?).<BR>
<BR>
So it sounds like a darn nasty bugger!  And one can see how it can confuse<BR>
the Crohn's issue.<BR>

FYI on Heparin for colitis <BR>
===================================================================<BR>
<BR>
Mr Kyle:<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your interest in the heparin study.  My colleague Dr Joshua<BR>
Korzenik, at Washington University in St Louis, is coordinating the study<BR>
and could answer your questions in more detail.<BR>
<BR>
Heparin is not approved for use in colitis in any country, so far as I am<BR>
aware, and must be considered purely experimental until properly conducted<BR>
studies (such as this one) show whether it has any benefit or role in<BR>
treatment.  While we think it works for some patients, we need a scientific<BR>
answer.<BR>
<BR>
In order to do this study we had to obtain approval from the FDA to study<BR>
heparin in colitis.  Even if our study shows a dramatic positive benefit, I<BR>
would not expect formal FDA approval of heparin for this indication for<BR>
some time, if ever.  We are still at step 1 (proving it works).<BR>
<BR>
If heparin works it will probably not be a long-term treatment option for<BR>
most patients, since long term treatment with heparin can lead to bone<BR>
problems.  This isn't a problem with short term use (as in our study).  It<BR>
is possible that other forms such as low molecular weight heparin (which<BR>
does not cause bone problems) might also be useful, but we are testing<BR>
regular heparin because we think it is most likely to be of benefit.<BR>
Heparin might induce remission in some, or in others serve as a bridge to<BR>
other therapies that can prolong remission of the disease.<BR>
<BR>
I would not advise you (or your son's physicians) to use heparin outside of<BR>
a medical study.  It is possible, though, that if he participated in the<BR>
study most of the interim blood tests could be done in your home town<BR>
instead of in Oklahoma City.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you again for your interest.  I wish your son success!  I'd encourage<BR>
you to contact Dr Korzenik for more information.<BR>

I knew as soon as I typed &quot;new&quot; that I'd hear about it!<BR>
<BR>
On page 49 of the Book, Elaine says that... &quot;any cereal grain is strictly<BR>
and absolutely forbidden, including corn, oats, wheat, rye, rice, millet,<BR>
buckwheeat, or triticale in any form, whether as bread, cake, toast,<BR>
zweiback, crackers, cookies, cereals, flour, or pastas.  New grain<BR>
substitutes are being placed on the market frequently.  Some such as<BR>
amaranth, quinoa, and cottonseed contain carbohydrates of unknown analysis<BR>
and are not recommended while on this diet&quot;...<BR>
<BR>
I don't know this for a fact, but I would imagine that spelt falls into the<BR>
above forbidden category.<BR>
<BR>
Anyone else have any thoughts about this?  Wouldn't it be nice if it were<BR>
all the above mentioned ones, except spelt!  Then, we wouldn't be using so<BR>
much almond flour, would we?  And spelt bread is sold in the whole foods<BR>
grocery stores in the refrigerator section...I'm drooling at the thought!<BR>

I have celiac disease and I tried spelt bread.  Forget it!  It went right<BR>
through me.  A grain is a grain, old or new.  The celiac diet which allows<BR>
certain grains i.e. rice, did not work very well for me as I could not handle<BR>
any of the allowable grains.  Although I still have some problems after only<BR>
6 wks on scd nothing has ever worked this well for me.  I hear what your<BR>
saying though about something other than almond flour!  But I can't believe<BR>
spelt is any answer.  Take care, Jane <BR>

&gt;Hi Paula,<BR>

&gt;&gt;   Does anyone know if a protein powder made from whey peptides ....<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I don't have the book with me, however I am certain that the key word<BR>
&gt;*whey* is a no-no on the diet.  I believe it is a variation of<BR>
&gt;wheat (or lactose).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks... Dan.<BR>
<BR>
I don't know, I think the key word might be peptides.  They are chains of<BR>
amino acids, and therefore not carbohydrates and should be allowed on the<BR>
diet.  If these are the only ingredients though, I don't know where the<BR>
carbohydrates that are listed on the label could be coming from.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

No way is spelt even an option here.  It is an old version of wheat,<BR>
containing much less gluten, but still some.   For those embarking on their<BR>
first elimination diet (most practitioner's will tell you to give up<BR>
sugars, wheat, corn and a few others) it is a good substitute.  For those<BR>
of poor digestive health, it's just wishful thinking.<BR>
<BR>
If I was in good health, I would probably have small amounts of spelt once<BR>
or twice a week, but probably no more.  It is full of complex<BR>
carbohydrates, starches, and is most certainly a cereal grain.<BR>
<BR>
As far as it being a benefit in Crohns, my guess is that it has no<BR>
therapeutic effect.  Many Crohn's cases are misdiagnosed as celiac (gluten<BR>
intolerance) and so in individuals able to digest a little gluten, they<BR>
would see results.<BR>

I am writing a letter to the editor of Newsweek to identify the &quot;very<BR>

would be more effective. So if anyone in the group who has regained their<BR>

I called Michael Vonelli yesterday, and he told me he has been on the SCD<BR>

I will look into the book you mentioned, but my mom already has the original<BR>
Sweedish Bitters recipe and has a bunch of it already made.  But it tastes<BR>
something awful.  Since it's made with alcohol (vodka), I keep getting drunk<BR>
off one simple dose (1 Tbs in a cup of tea 3 times a day).  Besides, I didn't<BR>
know the effect of alcohol on my compromised CD colon, so now I am<BR>

It seems that you are making super progress!  It has only been a short<BR>
while that he has been on SCD and you are seeing remarkable progress it<BR>
seems to me as an outside observer (reader of emails??).  A couple of<BR>
observations or comments about things you say here.  <BR>
<BR>
I am not aware that SCD is against the use of either Olive Leaf Extract<BR>
or Soil based organisms as you say.  I use both of them and feel they<BR>
are helping me. I have a long history with Candida.   My own energy has<BR>
increased gradually on SCD and I would not look for an overnite kind of<BR>
recovery, expecially after the &quot;hits&quot; he has taken to his immune system<BR>
with all the antibiotics etc.  I would look for a slow, but steady<BR>
increase in energy.  <BR>
<BR>
I would also try to go with his hunger instincts as much as is possible.<BR>
If he is hungry, give him more SCD food to eat.  His body is crying out<BR>
for nutrition it would seem.  Also, SCD tends to be a fairly low residue<BR>
type diet so it will not cause there to be huge amounts of stool.  At<BR>
least it does not with me.  Perhaps, others can comment on this too??<BR>
<BR>
Calcium Lactate is calcium bound to lactose sugar as I understand it,<BR>
and is not to be used at all with SCD.  This could be a big issue for<BR>
him right now.  Everything I read says that virtually all the foods we<BR>
eat have calcium in it and the idea of having to supplement more calcium<BR>
is most probably a myth.  &quot;Drink Your Milk&quot; is a multi billion dollar<BR>
advertising slogan and only causes more and more allergies.  Perhaps you<BR>
would do well to ask Elaine what she thinks about your sons need for<BR>
calcium supplementation.  If needed, I have read that Calcium &quot;AEP&quot; is<BR>
the best way to supplement CA. (I think this is the correct abbreviation<BR>
and I don't know what AEP means but perhaps someones else here does.)<BR>
<BR>
Whatever, I would encourage you to fell encouraged with the progress<BR>
that you are experiencing with your son!  Hang in there!<BR>

&gt; My son has a lot of tactile issues. He has improved, no longer jumps<BR>
&gt; when<BR>
&gt; you touch him, still it is painful for him to have you touch his head.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Would this be a bacterial issue, a candida issue, or what?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, he simply lacks the life of other children. He is not so much<BR>
&gt; autistic<BR>
&gt; as simply sick, with what I do not know. He has a pallor about him. He<BR>
&gt; was<BR>
&gt; on antibiotics for a long time for ear infections, which turned out to<BR>
&gt; be a<BR>
&gt; milk allergy.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; On the SCD diet, the diarrhea is gone. He had alternating bouts of<BR>
&gt; diarrhea<BR>
&gt; and by diarrhea I mean you would find a sticky mess in his pants, not<BR>
&gt; a<BR>
&gt; runny diarrhea. He had trouble controlling his bowels, now this<BR>
&gt; problem is gone.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So wouldn't this alone, mean he is absorbing at least some nutrients<BR>
&gt; better,<BR>
&gt; now that the diarrhea has stopped? <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; How would I know if he has Crohns, what are the symptoms? I have never<BR>
&gt; seen<BR>
&gt; a bloody stool, but then he is kind of private about the stools!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So, I feel the SCD diet is benefitting him in halting the diarrhea.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have not noticed more energy yet on the SCD diet, will this come? <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, the SCD diet seems (I could be wrong here) to be against using<BR>
&gt; supplements like Olive Leaf Extract, Soil Based Organisms, and so<BR>
&gt; forth.<BR>
&gt; Some of the parents of autistic kids are reporting success with the<BR>
&gt; above two.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have him on a totally natural SCD diet. I have been giving very<BR>
&gt; small<BR>
&gt; amounts of raw garlic to discourage fungus.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have also not been giving him much fruit.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; He can eat a ton of food, what is happening to it????? <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; A typical meal would be a Romaine salad with no dressing, some raw<BR>
&gt; yellow<BR>
&gt; peppers, a turkey burger, some winter squash with butter on it, and a<BR>
&gt; zucchini muffin for dessert. He can eat all of this and more and then<BR>
&gt; will<BR>
&gt; still say, &quot;I am hungry.&quot; This hunger was NOT there when he was on<BR>
&gt; carbos<BR>
&gt; such as rice bread, potatoes, etc.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Any ideas on how to get some weight on him? And some color?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I am also giving a multivitamin which sometimes makes him flush, I<BR>
&gt; think due<BR>
&gt; to the niacin. Also, am giving calcium lactate pills, as well as<BR>
&gt; friendly<BR>
&gt; bacteria.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I would like to start the dry curd cheese, have not started due to his<BR>
&gt; former dairy allergy. Am planning to try the cheesecake recipe with<BR>
&gt; much<BR>
&gt; smaller amounts of honey.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; If anyone has any ideas, I would appreciate it!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks,<BR>
&gt; <BR>

whey is a milk by-product and there are protien powders that claim to<BR>
have zero lactose in them.  I believe that there is whey in both DCCC<BR>
and Yoghurt but I could be mistaken about this.  Lactose is the issue it<BR>
seems, not whey.<BR>

&gt; Hi Paula,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;   Does anyone know if a protein powder made from whey peptides ....<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I don't have the book with me, however I am certain that the key word<BR>
&gt; *whey* is a no-no on the diet.  I believe it is a variation of<BR>
&gt; wheat (or lactose).<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks... Dan.<BR>

That is awesome!  I read that article and thought it was very well done.<BR>
I wondered about what diet he went on.  I sure wish they would have<BR>
mentioned that it was SCD and interviewed Elaine!<BR>

&gt; In case anyone is interested, in this weeks Newsweek magazine, Nov.<BR>
&gt; 17th,<BR>
&gt; page 95, there is an article titled &quot;Gut Reactions.&quot; There is mention<BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; a Michael Vonelli who had Crohn's and is now well thanks to a strict<BR>
&gt; diet<BR>
&gt; he went on. Elaine received a call from the reporter who wrote the<BR>
&gt; article because the diet Vonelli was on was the SCD. Unfortunately,<BR>
&gt; there<BR>
&gt; was no mention of the SCD.<BR>
