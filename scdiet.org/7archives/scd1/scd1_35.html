<BR>
&lt;&lt; Are some veggies higher in carbs than others?  If so, does<BR>
 anyone know where a breakdown of different veggie/carbohydrate<BR>
 ratios can be found?<BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Here's what I found from various sources, but I don't really have any<BR>
background in this.<BR>
<BR>
A person should get 200-300 grams of carbohydrate per day (RDA).  The amount<BR>
is a function of age, sex, activity level, etc.  If you are getting less than<BR>
60 grams per day your body could go into ketosis and burn body fat for<BR>
energy.  Bad breath (like rotting fruit) is a symptom of ketosis.  Whether<BR>
your body is in ketosis can be verified using urine test sticks available at<BR>
any drugstore.<BR>
<BR>
Here are some carb values for SCD foods:<BR>
<BR>
2 T. Peanut butter  8g<BR>
1 T. honey 17 g<BR>
1 apple 19 g<BR>
1 carrot 7 g<BR>
1 c. lima beans 24<BR>
1 c. string beans 10g<BR>
1 c. broccoli 5 g<BR>
1 c. cauliflower 7g<BR>
1 large eggplant 44 g<BR>
1 cup onions 13 g<BR>
1 c. spinach 6 g<BR>
1 c. spaghetti squash 9g<BR>
1 c. summer squash 5 g.<BR>
1 c. coconut 12 g<BR>
1 c. pinto beans 34 g.<BR>
1 c. applesauce 50 g.<BR>
1 c. apricots 54 g<BR>
1 c. blackberries 59 g<BR>
1 c. cranberries 12 g<BR>
1 c. grapes 28 g<BR>
1 c. apple juice 28 g<BR>
1 c. plain yogurt 15 g<BR>
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.<BR>

&gt;Hi group,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Here's &quot;Prescription for Nutritional Healing&quot; statement on psyllium:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Chemical and Nutrient Content:  Aucubine, enzyme, fats, glycosides,<BR>
mucilage, and protein.<BR>
<BR>
Actions and Uses:  Softens the stools, preventing constipation, colitis,<BR>
and hemorrhoids.  Cleans the intestines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Got a question for anyone !  JoEllen mentioned using Psyllium, even though she<BR>
&gt;had D. prior to starting the diet.  I recall (I believe) Denise saying that she<BR>
&gt;sometimes used it to help with constipation.  And doesn't Metamucil use this<BR>
&gt;ingredient (natural fibre).  I have been using it also as I was told it would<BR>
&gt;help.  Now I am wondering if perhaps it is more to help constipation and should<BR>
&gt;not be used when stools are loose.  Any comments ?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks... Dan.<BR>

I take six capules a day of Pure Encapsulations brand of &quot;Mineral 650.&quot;<BR>
It has a whole host of minerals in it besides the calcium and magnesium.<BR>
I get the Pure Encapsulations brand stuff through my husband, who is a<BR>
licensed acupuncturist/herbalist and can order it wholesale.  I don't<BR>
think it's available in the stores, but if you can get it, it's very<BR>
good.  All their products are.  I haven't looked in the stores for the<BR>
citrate but I imagine it is available, although probably more expensive<BR>
than the &quot;carbonate&quot; forms. I wish you luck in finding a good source.  I<BR>
know it's out there.  By the way, I heard recently in a conversation<BR>
with Odd from Denmark that magnesium deficiency can contribute to iron<BR>
deficiency anemia.  Anybody else know about this?<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes,<BR>
Denise<BR>
<BR>
G<BR>
&gt; Denise, thanks for your mineral suggestion.  I'll try it.  What dosage are<BR>
&gt; you taking?  Hope it continues to work for you ---and for our---well being.<BR>

Ellen, it's a great idea.  I would definitely be willing to participate <BR>
in something like this.  It would feel so good to contribute to having<BR>
diet proven a valid form of treatment.<BR>

&quot;If all of this worked out, we'd have a $200,000 study.<BR>

<BR>
Dan,<BR>
From what I remember hearing, psyllium can be helpful for both<BR>
constipation and diarrhea.  For constipation, it helps bulk up the stool<BR>
and lubricate, for diarrhea, it is soothing to inflamed tissue and can<BR>
help stool become more formed.  However, I myself never used it for the<BR>
diarrhea problem, so I'm not sure.  I do know that I had to adjust the<BR>
amount I used (one quarter teaspoon twice a day) because if I took more<BR>
than than, I got very achey-type symptoms, which were not pleasant.  But<BR>
the smaller dose did help and didn't hurt!<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Denise<BR>

Hello &quot;Dempsey&quot;,<BR>
<BR>
I hope I am reading all this right. I am new at the computer.<BR>
<BR>
I found pages of correspondence concerning SCD which I finally figured<BR>
out to be SPECIFIC CHARBOHYDRATE DIET.<BR>
<BR>
Is there a home page? <BR>
What is the title of the book everyone talks about?<BR>
What's Elaine's last name?<BR>
Is there membership involved?<BR>
<BR>
I am interested because I am gluten sensitive.<BR>
<BR>
I hope you can help me with these questions.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your help.<BR>

<BR>
Hello, I have been reading and gaining hope from the letters and info =<BR>
exchanged for a couple of weeks.. &quot;Thanks&quot; is all I can say and it is =<BR>
certainly not enough.  My husband wrote for me last week because I was =<BR>
too weak and tired to do it myself.  The info helped so much.  I have =<BR>
been diagnosed with IBS and have been on a downhill path for the last =<BR>
three years, the last of which was spent on muscle relaxers whenever I =<BR>
ate.  By June, I was severely reacting to all food that entered my body. =<BR>
 That's when I found the info on SCD and have improved greatly, without =<BR>
muscle relaxers or other drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Hey, I did 1 pull-up yesterday!  My strength seems to be improving.  I' =<BR>
ve actually had a good couple of days in a row, including strength, no =<BR>
pain, and no D.  I really think the energy difference has been the =<BR>
addition of nut flour from the Hughson company.  I had tried to grind my =<BR>
own, but could not tolerate it.  But I have had nut muffins since =<BR>
Thursday and saw an almost immediate rise in energy.  I am still =<BR>
struggling to get enough carbs into the day, as I cannot eat anything =<BR>
that has not been cooked beyond recognition. Fresh Fruits and Veggies =<BR>
are out (so is eating out).<BR>
<BR>
I have some questions about adding beans to my diet.  Tomorrow will =<BR>
complete my second month on the SCD.  When my energy hit such a low =<BR>
about 1 1/2 weeks ago, I called Elaine and she suggested adding beans =<BR>
(and B-12).  Her instructions were to eat them without the skins for at =<BR>
least the first month.  After soaking the navy beans overnight, then =<BR>
cooking them, I still don't see how to get the skin off (short of doing =<BR>
each bean individually).  I went ahead and tried the baked bean recipe =<BR>
and had a bad reaction (not sure if it was the beans, but I think so).  =<BR>
How do you get the skin off of the beans? I'm open for suggestions.<BR>
<BR>
I have also been seeing a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine with =<BR>
very good results.  He has been very emphatic about me eating all of my =<BR>
food and drink warmed or heated.  It certainly feels good going down.  =<BR>
Has anyone else looked into this alternative path? It is also nice just =<BR>
to have a doctor listen and care.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, if I wrote too much.  It just feels so good to get to &quot;talk&quot; with =<BR>
others who know.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,=20<BR>

Dan, I began taking Psyllium out of frustration!  I was having trouble with D<BR>
(this was before I even hear about SCD) and my GI perscribed &quot;Colestid&quot; (a<BR>
cholestral<BR>
lowering drug) and I was not happy about that. The side effect is<BR>
Constipation.  Again, treating the symptoms. I did not want to resort to that<BR>
(I already take the full dosage of Pentasa) and put more drugs into my body<BR>
if I didn't have to. In complete despair, I went to an Herbalist who I had<BR>
gone to before and asked her if she had anything that had a side effect of<BR>
constipation.  She suggested the Psyllium and I thought I would give it a<BR>
try. Yes, it is also used for constipation and I think drinking alot of water<BR>
might be effective for the Psyllium to work in that way.I do not drink an<BR>
excessive amount of water and this has been working for me. Now I will admit,<BR>
that soon after I began taking the Psyllium, and before learning about SCD, I<BR>
was omitting wheat, yeast &amp; sugar from my diet, but was eating rice.  Now<BR>
since I am on SCD, I am not sure that I even need the Psyllium, but I think<BR>
it is too soon for me to chance it.  I have info on the Psyllium if you would<BR>
like it. It is made by Nature Sunshine.  Best regards, JoEllen<BR>

Hi Hazel,<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the diet for about 3 months now - the last month or so =<BR>
after coming off Prednisolone.  It seems to be working well despite =<BR>
apathy from my NHS  &quot;specialist&quot; - my homeopath on the other hand thinks =<BR>
its a good idea.  Some of the items in the book are difficult to get =<BR>
hold of but I'm not sure whether that's particular to the UK, or an =<BR>
international problem.  It's been hard to stick to the diet when you've =<BR>
got two young kids and a pregnant wife, but it's amazing how creative =<BR>
you can get by adding the forbidden substances at the end of the cooking =<BR>
process.  Also, having a garden half full of fresh, organic potatoes is =<BR>
hard to pass up!<BR>

Firstly,  is there anyone in the UK on this list?  I know of several =<BR>
other=20<BR>
practitioners in this country who are keen to try this diet with their=20<BR>
client's but who are struggling to find suppliers for several of the SCD =<BR>
<BR>
staples.  A good example of this is the farmer's cheese.  If there is =<BR>
anyone=20<BR>
out there who can help?   I would be happy to pass this information to =<BR>
other=20<BR>
nutritionists.  I would love to speak to someone in this country who has =<BR>
<BR>
successfully used the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly, as part of my studies I am writing a dissertation on the=20<BR>
Nutritional Management of Crohn's Disease.  I was interested in Ted's=20<BR>
message which mentioned some relevant papers.  If anyone has information =<BR>
on=20<BR>
papers that relate to diet and Crohn's I would be really grateful.<BR>
<BR>
I will be on email at work on                  hazel.pelham@bbc.co.uk=20<BR>
         until 16 September when I am leaving work to set up my =<BR>
nutrition=20<BR>
practise.<BR>
<BR>
Having suffered 7 years of Crohn's, I have been 99% symptom free for the =<BR>

Good Luck and Good Health to you all.<BR>

Elaine Gotschall is the author of &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; and<BR>
there's no membership fee, except that you respect everyone and not veer<BR>
the &quot;threads&quot; of conversation away from the SCD.<BR>
We all got your posting to our LISTSERVER, which is all about the SCD<BR>
(Specific Carbohydrate Diet). Most of us are afflicted with some<BR>
intestinal disorder, be it colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, chrons<BR>
disease, or any number of things. Here you will find postings from<BR>
people like me who are no longer suffering from symptoms, and are<BR>
maintaining our health by adhering to the SCD with support from this<BR>
group.  There are also plenty of folks new to the diet as well, who are<BR>
just discovering the benefits.  Below I've pasted some info on how to<BR>
&quot;subscribe&quot; to the LISTSERVER. Once you do, you will find about 20 or so<BR>

&gt; In a message dated 97-09-08 12:28:26 EDT, you write:<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &lt;&lt; Are some veggies higher in carbs than others?  If so, does<BR>
&gt;  anyone know where a breakdown of different veggie/carbohydrate<BR>
&gt;  ratios can be found?<BR>
&gt;   &gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Here's what I found from various sources, but I don't really have any<BR>
&gt; background in this.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; A person should get 200-300 grams of carbohydrate per day (RDA).  The amount<BR>
&gt; is a function of age, sex, activity level, etc.  If you are getting less than<BR>
&gt; 60 grams per day your body could go into ketosis and burn body fat for<BR>
&gt; energy.  Bad breath (like rotting fruit) is a symptom of ketosis.  Whether<BR>
&gt; your body is in ketosis can be verified using urine test sticks available at<BR>
&gt; any drugstore.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Here are some carb values for SCD foods:<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 2 T. Peanut butter  8g<BR>
&gt; 1 T. honey 17 g<BR>
&gt; 1 apple 19 g<BR>
&gt; 1 carrot 7 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. lima beans 24<BR>
&gt; 1 c. string beans 10g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. broccoli 5 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. cauliflower 7g<BR>
&gt; 1 large eggplant 44 g<BR>
&gt; 1 cup onions 13 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. spinach 6 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. spaghetti squash 9g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. summer squash 5 g.<BR>
&gt; 1 c. coconut 12 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. pinto beans 34 g.<BR>
&gt; 1 c. applesauce 50 g.<BR>
&gt; 1 c. apricots 54 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. blackberries 59 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. cranberries 12 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. grapes 28 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. apple juice 28 g<BR>
&gt; 1 c. plain yogurt 15 g<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I hope this is helpful.<BR>

Got a question for anyone !  JoEllen mentioned using Psyllium, even =<BR>
though she<BR>
had D. prior to starting the diet.  I recall (I believe) Denise saying =<BR>
that she<BR>
sometimes used it to help with constipation.  And doesn't Metamucil use =<BR>
this<BR>
ingredient (natural fibre).  I have been using it also as I was told it =<BR>
would<BR>
help.  Now I am wondering if perhaps it is more to help constipation and =<BR>
should<BR>
not be used when stools are loose.  Any comments ?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dan,<BR>
<BR>
About a month ago someone in the group said I shouldn't use Metamucil, =<BR>
so I stopped using it. After I stopped my sessions, in the bathroom got =<BR>
worse. At first the stools were solid, but mixed with a lot of water; =<BR>
then I got diarrhea that wouldn't stop. After putting up with this for a =<BR>
week and a half, I decided to get back on the Metamucil. Within a couple =<BR>
of days my stools were well formed. All I can say, for me, is that =<BR>
Metamucil helps dry things up in my colon. My gastroentronologist says =<BR>
Metamucil is the great equalizer--it stops both diarrhea and =<BR>
constipation.<BR>

Hi Stephanie,<BR>
Another method is to run the cooked beans through a Foley (brand) food<BR>
mill. You can get one for about 15 bucks. The end product is mashed beans.<BR>
The food mill is usually used for getting seeds out of raspberries, and<BR>
apple skins out of apple sauce, etc. Elaine suggested the food mill when I<BR>
was having bloating problems with eating beans. I am wondering if Joaqim's<BR>
method might be more thorough. Possibly little bits of skin still make it<BR>
through the mill.<BR>
Just thought I'd mention it in case you are not up to peeling each bean.<BR>
Good luck.<BR>
Lucy <BR>
PS. I would suggest trying a small amount of the beans in the beginning,<BR>
and see how you do. As I recall, if I had a bloating problem with them, it<BR>
would take sometimes 2 weeks for whatever had set up camp in there to die<BR>
off.<BR>

&gt;&gt;Denise, Carolyn,<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;you write that you eat tons of food, protein and very little fruit and<BR>
&gt;&gt;honey; I am wondering if your &quot;brain fog&quot; could come from not enough carbs?<BR>
&gt;&gt;On this diet, we do have to really take care that we are getting<BR>
&gt;&gt;enough...I don't think I do sometimes and am considering eating squash or<BR>
&gt;&gt;zucchini, etc. for breakfast in addition to the yogurt and dry curd cottage<BR>
&gt;&gt;combination, since I, too, can't tolerate much honey and very little fruit<BR>
&gt;&gt;at this point (almost 3 mos. on diet).<BR>
&gt;&gt;I think I'll run an experiment for the next week and have at least one<BR>
&gt;&gt;vegetable high in carbs for breakfast in addition to my usual, and see if<BR>
&gt;&gt;my &quot;light headedness&quot; and propensity to lie down a lot decreases!  Also,<BR>
&gt;&gt;the past 10 days or so, I have been having dull headaches!<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Will let you know if things change after having the added carbs for breakfast.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Prateeksha<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Hi Prateeksha,<BR>
&gt;  I think eating enough (specific) carbohydrates are a challenge for me,<BR>
&gt;but I don't tolerate them well.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;  When I first started the diet I could hardly keep -any- food in me and<BR>
&gt;was losing weight like crazy.  When I got really desparate, read the<BR>
&gt;beginning diet instructions over again and started over, it became a long,<BR>
&gt;patient, effort just to keep my tummy from rumbling, maintain my energy,<BR>
&gt;and keep me from getting D. (which I am still working on), etc.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;  I've introduced fruits very slowly, and just can't seem to tolerate them<BR>
&gt;yet.  Same with very much variation on vegetables.  I still suspect honey,<BR>
&gt;although I am doing ok with it in almond bread.  Even eggs give me D.<BR>
&gt;Cheese is still a problem.  Has anyone else been this sensitive for this<BR>
&gt;long? or is it just me?  I am much, much better.  My reactions seem to be<BR>
&gt;less severe, which I take to be an improvement, and a matter of time before<BR>
&gt;my system can handle it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;  I eat butternut squash and hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I<BR>
&gt;vary it with chicken, fish, zucchini, raw tomatoes, avacado, cooked apple,<BR>
&gt;yogurt, almond bread (made with apple and butternut squash).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I've been on the diet (almost properly) for about eight months and can't<BR>
&gt;quite shake the D. in the AM.  Some days are better than others.  Gets<BR>
&gt;worse, apparently during menstruation.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;  I'd be interested in specific carbohydrate tips, too.  Maybe I should try<BR>
&gt;eating butternut squash for a snack.  Not very appetizing sounding, but it<BR>
&gt;might be worth a try. Recipe anyone?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Best wishes,  Carolyn<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear Carolyn,<BR>
<BR>
My body, also, is very, very sensitive and I have had very similar reaction<BR>
to foods as you have and I've only been on the diet 3 months soon.  Over<BR>
the weekend, I beefed up my intake of vegetables I tolerate and noticed<BR>
this morning in getting up that my legs were not &quot;rubbery&quot; and I didn't<BR>
feel weak, as I have been feeling, so I think I'm on to something for me<BR>
with respect to the weakness.  I find avacado very tolerable and it is high<BR>
in fat, so a good way to maintain the weight.  Why not have a snack of<BR>
avacado?  I can tolerate grape juice only ... if I cut it with water by<BR>
half, and grapes are very high in carbs.  I usually take it as a &quot;snack&quot;.<BR>
If the banana is very ripe, I'm okay, otherwise...D.  So, you and I will<BR>
have to just go slower than some of the others, huh?<BR>

Dear Liz,<BR>
<BR>
I called Friendship Dairies ( #in the SCD book) and they told me that the<BR>
cream is added before the cheese is made so that there is less than 1/2 of<BR>
1% of lactose in it.<BR>
<BR>
I recently tried Rachel's method (electric oven, using only the light bulb<BR>
for heating the yogurt) and it works better than anything else I have<BR>
tried, i.e. Donvier yogurt maker, heating pad, crock pot, plus...you can<BR>
make so much more at one time!  I make enough for a week and it seems to be<BR>
fine.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Good morning all,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;A couple of questions which I'd appreciate help with:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1) How long can the homemade yoghurt stay fresh in the<BR>
&gt;   refrigerator once it's been &quot;cooked&quot;?  More than a<BR>
&gt;   couple of days?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2) Is Friendship Farmer's cheese ok to use?  It's got<BR>
&gt;   skim milk, cream and salt.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;3) I've not yet tried to make the yogurt.  I'm extremely<BR>
&gt;   intolerant to dairy at this time.  In addition,<BR>
&gt;   I cannot tolerate pro-biotic formulas at all either.<BR>
&gt;   They make my symptoms worse.  I will try the yoghurt<BR>
&gt;   once I find a good stable 100-110 degree location to<BR>
&gt;   cook it.  Though, I worry.  What if I can't tolerate<BR>
&gt;   it, and I can't take pro-biotics?  How do I get the<BR>
&gt;   &quot;good&quot; bacteria in me?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Kind regards,<BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Dear Stephanie,<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the diet almost 3 mos.  I agree with you, this group is wonderful!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Hey, I did 1 pull-up yesterday!  My strength seems to be improving.  I' ve<BR>
&gt;actually had a good couple of days in a row, including strength, no pain,<BR>
&gt;and no D.  I really think the energy difference has been the addition of<BR>
&gt;nut flour from the Hughson company.  I had tried to grind my own, but<BR>
&gt;could not tolerate it.  But I have had nut muffins since Thursday and saw<BR>
&gt;an almost immediate rise in energy.  I am still struggling to get enough<BR>
&gt;carbs into the day, as I cannot eat anything that has not been cooked<BR>
&gt;beyond recognition. Fresh Fruits and Veggies are out (so is eating out<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have been amazed at the difference in grinding my own nuts in the food<BR>
processor and the ground nut flour from Hughson Nut Company.  The muffins I<BR>
made over the weekend are much more similar to muffins made with flour.  I<BR>
also have been experiencing more energy since I have been eating these nut<BR>
flour muffins...also, I used Lucy's recently altered recipe for Barb<BR>
Partridge's carrot cake that was given last week, and put even more carrots<BR>
in it; however, they were a little (not much) too moist; next time I will<BR>
just lower the heat to 315 and see if that makes them &quot;perfect.&quot;  I also<BR>
made the zucchini muffins and I have one of each of these in addition to<BR>
dry curd cottage cheese mixed with homemade yogurt or squash soup with<BR>
yogurt for breakfast and I am feeling much stronger!<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I have also been seeing a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine with very<BR>
&gt;good results.  He has been very emphatic about me eating all of my food<BR>
&gt;and drink warmed or heated.  It certainly feels good going down.  Has<BR>
&gt;anyone else looked into this alternative path? It is also nice just to<BR>
&gt;have a doctor listen and care.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I was in the care of an accupuncturist who practices Traditional Chinese<BR>
Medicine, for about 8 months...it helped.  His big thing with me was<BR>
constantly encouraging me to sleep more...that the body needs lots of sleep<BR>
to heal...and not drink anything cold!  or too hot!  Keep it at room<BR>
temperature.  Another jewel he gave me was when I complained about<BR>
excruiating gas blockage that prompted me to want to call 911 if I could<BR>
have gotten to a phone to come to the hospital.  I told him how I had told<BR>
my Kaiser gastroenterologist about this and that he had replied &quot;it<BR>
wouldn't have done any good...we couldn't have helped you.&quot;  Dr. Lee said,<BR>
&quot;oh, just put heat on your belly, and it will go away.&quot;  Well, I have done<BR>
that a lot since then and it works like a charm!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Regards, Prateeksha<BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I've been eating the granola recipe with nuts, raisins and cocoanut and feel<BR>
like I am having indigestion in the stomach area.  I think it's the cocoanut<BR>
because it happened before when I ate it.  Does anybody else have trouble<BR>
eating cocoanut?<BR>

Metamucil contains sugar -- not allowed, so I hope your not using it.  I<BR>

whether or not it helps D, I can't say -- about 4 years ago, my gastro<BR>

Metamucil!!<BR>

Hi Everyone,<BR>
I received a copy of a fax that Elaine has sent to Lotte Wackerhagen, (the<BR>
woman who has translated &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; into Danish). <BR>
Lotte's questions to Elaine had been: <BR>
1) if she could enclose some Danish recipes in the Danish edition of the book<BR>
2) if a doctor who Lotte knows could add his comments to the book <BR>
3) what Elaine would think of if we convinced a Danish (organic) dairy to begin<BR>
to produce 24-hour lactose free yoghurt.<BR>
This is Elaine's answer - some of which I think has a general interest.<BR>
<BR>
Yours,<BR>
Mik<BR>

<BR>
Fax from Elaine Gottschall <BR>
To: Lotte Wackerhagen <BR>
 <BR>
Date: September 8, 1997 <BR>
 <BR>
Before answering the questions about recipes, I would like to address two main<BR>
issues: <BR>
 (1) the changes and additions that your doctor would like to make and <BR>
 (2) why commercial yoghurt is unsatisfactory and SHOULD NOT BE USED. The<BR>
second question has been asked me constantly by many people and I have almost<BR>
run out of<BR>
patience in going over the biochemistry of this. So, if Mik Aidt would put it<BR>
into his repository of information on the SCD, I would be most grateful. <BR>
 <BR>
1. The medical doctor is not a research scientist and most do not follow<BR>
research findings. I do not know what group hands down his protocol for<BR>
patients<BR>
but they usually have one thing in mind: CRISIS INTERVENTION. This is often<BR>
diametrically opposed to restoring real health. <BR>
 For example, most people with inflammatory bowel disease have iron-deficiency<BR>
anemia and sometimes, pernicious anemia. To give iron supplements and iron<BR>
injections for a very short period is OK but hardly, if ever, resolves the<BR>
problem. In fact, the oral iron supplements generally exacerbate the intestinal<BR>
problem and are known to increase bacterial infections. (The research into this<BR>
area fills volumes). <BR>
 The proper way to treat would be to make sure sufficient folic acid and B-12<BR>
are<BR>
given (often by injections) and try to get the patient to eat eggs and liver<BR>
and<BR>
iron found in the hemoglobin of animal foods. Of course, the best way to treat<BR>
is<BR>
to cure the diarrhea which is preventing the absorption of all nutrients,<BR>
vitamins, minerals, calories. <BR>
 <BR>
2. Commercial yoghurt <BR>
Practically every dairy in Northern America has Dept. of Agriculture<BR>
instructions for making commercial yoghurt. <BR>
 They may start with liquid milk straight from the cow (pasteurized) or they<BR>
may<BR>
start with milk solids. However, at the beginning, the ADD additional milk<BR>
solids. This automatically increases the lactose content. For example, if cow's<BR>
milk originally has 10% lactose (10 gms per 100 mls) then the addition brings<BR>
it<BR>
up to 20% or even 30%. <BR>
 The second step is to introduce the bacterial cultures (usually Lactobacillus<BR>
Bulgaricus and Steptococcus Thermophilus). At this point the acid/base - the pH<BR>
of the milk - is much like human fluid, around 7.2-7.3 (almost neutral on the<BR>
pH<BR>
scale). The bacteria immediately start converting the lactose to lactic acid<BR>
which is the primary step in making yoghurt. This brings the pH down from<BR>
neutral<BR>
to about 4.5 as the lactic ACID accumulates. (Acid lowers pH as our stomach<BR>
acid<BR>
brings the pH of our stomachs down to about 2). <BR>
 When the pH hits about 4.5, the bacterial enzymes cannot further convert the<BR>
remaining lactose. Bacterial enzymes (as is true of all enzymes) are very<BR>
fastidious as to the acid/alkaline enviroment. Because of the addetional<BR>
lactose<BR>
added at the beginning of the process, the yoghurt often contains at this stage<BR>
as much, and probably more, lactose than a glass of milk would. <BR>
 The companies also use a very short incubation time which is not even<BR>
sufficient<BR>
to convert normal milk lactose completely. <BR>
 <BR>
Dr. Sidney Haas instructed us to make our own yoghurt. I DID!!! When I studied,<BR>
I had to learn manufacturing techniques and I did to the best of my ability. I<BR>
never dreamed that people who are sick as those with IBD would challenge and<BR>
question and balk at this. It is beyond my ability to understand.<BR>
<BR>
Concerning the suggested Appendix<BR>
Yes, it would be great to give your explanation of the cheeses.<BR>
The two recipes for liverspread and dry curd would be a helpful addition.<BR>
However, the dry curd is only necessary for the baby formula and the Lois Lang<BR>
bread. It seems very complicated (more so than the yoghurt) and they really do<BR>
not have to have that bread - the muffins are really quite sufficient.<BR>
By the way, for those who do make the bread, if one puts a slice of it in hte<BR>
microwave for about 40 secs. (one needs to experiment) you have a crunchy<BR>
cracker.<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt; I'm  wondering the same thing!   On August 21, Ellen gave such a breakdown<BR>
 by the cup, no less, of a few foods in our diet, and I am indeed interested<BR>
 to learn how she came up with this very vital information?! &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Well, I looked around the web and came up with a downloadable nutrition<BR>
program.  It's designed so that you can plan your menus and it will tally up<BR>
the calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein.  The demo program which is<BR>
downloadable only has a limited number of foods (600 I think--evidently the<BR>
full program has 8000 foods).  I just browsed the demo program and picked out<BR>
the ones that were relevant to the diet.  I'm pretty sure the place I<BR>
downloaded it from is:<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/food/ngcrd45.zip">ftp://ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/food/ngcrd45.zip</A><BR>
<BR>
It was interesting to play around with.  I made up a sample day's menus that<BR>
would comply with SCD and it had 180% of the protein required, 180% of the<BR>
fat, 120% of the calories, and only 80% of the carbohydrates.  (This is<BR>
relative to the RDA based on age, sex, weight, activity level).  Anyway, it<BR>
was interesting.  I know that they sell &quot;carbohydrate counters&quot;--small books<BR>
that list the carbohydrate values in foods--but this was an easy shortcut<BR>
that didn't require a trip to the bookstore.  <BR>
<BR>
I think that those who want to gain weight on this diet will need to keep<BR>
their carbs up, and that those who might have weight to lose would want to<BR>
minimize them.  Honey appears to be the easiest way to add carbs (or cut them<BR>
back) since it is packed with carbs (17 g per Tablespoon), and can optionally<BR>
be added or deleted in yogurt shakes, muffins, etc.<BR>

	I have had virtually no success in getting messages posted lately, but I<BR>
will try again. I love the discussions about brain fog. I thought that this<BR>
was about the weirdest symptom of them all. I couldn't explain to people<BR>
that I felt like I was completely in a fog all the time. I found on the<BR>
sheet that came with the Rowasa that one of the side effects was dizziness<BR>
and headaches. This and Cortifoam were the only meds I used. That was the<BR>
end of them. The diet did it for me without any drugs at all!  I can't<BR>
remember what had any real effect on the spaciness, but sticking to the<BR>
plan got rid of all the symptoms eventually. It's been about two months now<BR>
that I feel completely normal, and sticking to the plan for sure.<BR>
	Good luck to all<BR>

&gt; Hi Stephanie,<BR>
&gt; Another method is to run the cooked beans through a Foley (brand) food<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; mill. You can get one for about 15 bucks. The end product is mashed<BR>
&gt; beans.<BR>
&gt; The food mill is usually used for getting seeds out of raspberries,<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; apple skins out of apple sauce, etc. Elaine suggested the food mill<BR>
&gt; when I<BR>
&gt; was having bloating problems with eating beans. I am wondering if<BR>
&gt; Joaqim's<BR>
&gt; method might be more thorough. Possibly little bits of skin still make<BR>
&gt; it<BR>
&gt; through the mill.<BR>
&gt; Just thought I'd mention it in case you are not up to peeling each<BR>
&gt; bean.<BR>
&gt; Good luck.<BR>
&gt; Lucy<BR>
&gt; PS. I would suggest trying a small amount of the beans in the<BR>
&gt; beginning,<BR>
&gt; and see how you do. As I recall, if I had a bloating problem with<BR>
&gt; them, it<BR>
&gt; would take sometimes 2 weeks for whatever had set up camp in there to<BR>
&gt; die<BR>
&gt; off.<BR>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  After soaking the navy beans overnight, then cooking them, I<BR>
&gt; still<BR>
&gt; don't<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;see how to get the skin off (short of doing each bean<BR>
&gt; individually).  I<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;went ahead and tried the baked bean recipe and had a bad reaction<BR>
&gt; (not<BR>

&gt; &gt; First, you soak the beans. Then, you take their skin off (at this<BR>

&gt; it<BR>
&gt; &gt; is quite simple, although it takes some time). Finaly, you cook<BR>

&gt;Thanks for the info on the Foley food mill. Sounds like this could be very<BR>
&gt;helpful.   Do you have any info on where or how to get one?<BR>

<BR>
Dear Stephanie,<BR>
<BR>
I bought one yesterday...at Whole Earth in San Rafael, California!  $29.00<BR>
plus tax.  Foley's brand.  Probably a lot of department stores (Macy's) who<BR>
have a kitchen accessories department would have them; also gourmet kitchen<BR>
accessory shops that are sometimes in malls.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck!  Prateeksha<BR>

Hello everybody:<BR>
I was diagnosed with UC approximately 5 months ago and have been <BR>
taking Mesasol (5-Aminosalic Acid) ever since. It usually works well <BR>
but I've got to take quite a bit of it.<BR>
I will be starting the SC Diet on Monday. In preparation for this I <BR>
was hoping somebody may be able to give me some advice on what to <BR>
expect. For example, does the lack of carbohydrate in your diet cause <BR>
physical problems? Have you initially experienced much weight loss / <BR>
gain?<BR>
I would appreciate any info.<BR>
<BR>
Also, is anyboby else taking Mesasol?<BR>

Hi Ron,<BR>
<BR>
I have been on and off the diet now for about 11 months.  The best advise I<BR>
could give, and I think everyone would agree with me, would be to promise<BR>
yourself that you will stick to the diet.  Because I did not faithfully<BR>
stick to the diet, I feel I not only cheat myself, but also slowed down my<BR>
progress to recovery.<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, when I began the diet I felt very sluggish, but I have found that<BR>
the nut flour has provided me my much needed energy.  At the start of diet<BR>
I had a hard time tolerating vegetables even when I cooked them for a long<BR>
time--they provided alot of gas to me, but I found that when I added a few<BR>
drops of BEANO (found in supermarkets) to my vegetables I was able to<BR>
tolerate them.<BR>
<BR>
During the first few weeks of the diet, you will probably lose some weight.<BR>
If you are overly concerned about this, the nut flour provides alot of<BR>
calories.  Also, I recently learned from someone that avacados are<BR>
fattening, so Buon Appetit!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Let us know how you are doing.  In addition to the diet I take Pentasa (16<BR>
pills a day), but I am hoping that I will ween off of them in the near<BR>
future.<BR>
<BR>
Stay Well &amp; Make the Promise to Yourself!!!!!!!!<BR>
<BR>

Hi Ron! Welcome to the SCD group.  I was in your position about a year<BR>
and a half ago.  When I received the book, I laughed to myself...HA! ME<BR>
GIVE UP PIZZA? ICE CREAM? BEER? Well, I figured I'd give it a shot.<BR>
Your experience will differ depending on how sick you are.  If you have<BR>
diareah now, it is harder to start the diet, since alot of the food can<BR>
be irritating to an irritated stomach.  If you are reasnably in good<BR>
shape, you're in luck, and you can go full steam into the diet. Prepare<BR>
yourself to spend some time shopping and cooking.  Learn to enjoy<BR>
cooking.  Trust me, this is going to be a lifelong journey, so go out<BR>
and get some good non-stick pots and pans and tools that you will enjoy<BR>
working with.  Order some almond flour and freeze it (Hughson nut<BR>
company offers us a discount, their number is 209 883 0403.  You can get<BR>
dry curd cottage cheese (trust me, you can make awesome desserts) from<BR>
Stewarts in Vermont at 802 259 2311. No, I don't have stock in these<BR>
companies, but try to find substitutes, and let us know!  Also get a<BR>
yoghurt maker and eat yoghurt every day, which will help balance the<BR>
bacteria in your tummy so that the healing process goes smoother.<BR>
Initally, it's hard to maintain a food supply, but once you develop the<BR>
habits, you won't miss the &quot;illegal&quot; foods much, since the diet is all<BR>
tastey and healthy.  You may have some initial reactions as your system<BR>
adjusts, like being hungry.  I was worried about cholesterol initally,<BR>
eating lots of eggs and nuts.  But mine has gone down since being on the<BR>
diet.  If you are somewhat symptomatic now, you will first notice that<BR>
your bowel movements per day will decrease, as the swelling and mucus<BR>
diminish. This is because your system isn't trying to process all those<BR>
complex carbos that it can't handle at this stage.  In time, with proper<BR>
diet (the SCD!) your health will be restored, and you will be able to<BR>
process ccomplex carbos, some day way in the future!  I expecct to be on<BR>
the diet for life, because I think that I'm pre-disposed to UC.  If I<BR>
quit the diet, I'll be OK for a brief period, and I wouldn't want to run<BR>
the risk of getting really sick again.  I gained weight on the diet, but<BR>
only to the point of my prelove-handles days, which is 155 lbs I was 165<BR>
when I had &quot;love handles&quot; I've never had much access weight.  I believe<BR>
that I am at my optimum weight now, after being on the diet for 1.5<BR>
years, and eating to my heart's content.<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the responses.<BR>
<BR>
I guess I will continue to use it since I stopped for a few days to test<BR>
for any reaction.  Things did not get worse.  I use a product called<BR>
&quot;Herbal Fibre Formula 13&quot; which contains Psyllium husks, black walnut,<BR>
butternut bark, chinese rhubarb root, chinese licorice root, bentonite,<BR>
and fennel seed.<BR>
<BR>
Do you think any of these other ingredients are a problem ?<BR>
<BR>
P.S.  Glenn,  I have never used Metamucil, and never will.  Also, your<BR>
last posts have been coming in fine (thanks for fixing).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
I've been on the diet for a week now &amp; cannot believe I'm still alive!<BR>
It was very rough the first 3 days...so hungry!<BR>
<BR>
Is xanthan gum an allowed ingredient or is it a starch/thickener?<BR>
Someone asked this before but I never saw an answer.<BR>
<BR>
Also, if  &quot;natural&quot; juices and &quot;all-fruit&quot; jams,etc. have &quot;puree&quot;  or<BR>
&quot;concentrate&quot; in them, should they be avoided?<BR>
<BR>
Welch's grape juice was previously recommended, but it has grape juice<BR>
concentrate as one of its ingredients.<BR>
<BR>
I think it was Anna  who had a lemondade recipe and I see she's gone for<BR>
a while. Does anyone else have a recipe they could share?<BR>
<BR>
Finally, does anyone know how to substitute the almond flour for regular<BR>
flours, for example: does 1c. plain flour = 1c. almond flour?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

 It may be that this food mill is not as broadly available as one might<BR>

potato ricer.  It's designed to produce mashed potatoes from unpeeled<BR>
potatoes--the potato middle goes into the bowl and the skin remains behind.<BR>
 Williams and Sonoma offers one for $12.00.  They advocate it for potatoes,<BR>
turnips, yams, and carrots (I guess they just didn't think of peeling<BR>
beans!).  Their phone number is 1-800-541-2233 and the item number is<BR>

If it's just a salt, I'm guessing it would be fine.  Anyone else?<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I've been meaning to post this for a while (ever since I made Lucy's quiche<BR>
a couple of weeks ago).The quiche was such a hit that I thought I should<BR>
maybe contribute a recipe in return. Her cocanut cookies were also a big<BR>
hit. Anyway this has become a staple in our house. If you've tried and<BR>
liked the eggplant soup in the book, then you are bound to enjoy this as<BR>
well. I like to put sweet red peppers in it as well (which I roast along<BR>
with the eggplant), but the actual recipe doesn't call for it. you'll need:<BR>
<BR>
1.  2 large eggplants<BR>
2.  2 sweet red bell or other large peppers (optional)<BR>
3.  3 large cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed<BR>
4.  4 tablespoons tahini(sesame butter)...If you can't get this or don't<BR>
like it,you can leave it out, especially if you add the peppers.<BR>
5.  5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. This is supposed to be floated<BR>
on the top as a garnish. We just mix it in though. that way we can serve<BR>
ourselves right out of the tupperware container in the refridgerator<BR>
6. the juice of one large lemon or lime<BR>
7, chopped parsley garnish (if it isn't fresh, don't bother)<BR>
8.  a blender. I strongly recommend a hand blender, it's easier to use and<BR>
clean.<BR>
<BR>
This should make about a quart. Here we go:<BR>
<BR>
1. Remove the pan from your broiler, and line a large baking pan with foil<BR>
2  remove the green caps from the stem end of the eggplants or puncture<BR>
them with a fork. If you don't, they may blow up. Trust me, I know.<BR>
3. Put eggplants and peppers (if you are using them) in the pan, and put<BR>
the pan in your broiler. If your broiler pan will adjust to a low enough<BR>
position, you could use the broiler pan of course.<BR>
4. Broil them until the skin of the eggplants is brown and crackly, and the<BR>
peppers are black. turn them from time to time during this so that they<BR>
cook evenly.<BR>
5. Remove when done, and cut the eggplants in two lengthwise. Scoop the<BR>
inside into a bowl and discard the skin.<BR>
6. remove the burnt pepper skins, the stems, and the cores. I usually do<BR>
this in water(running or in a bowl), its really easy that way. Cut the<BR>
peppers into strips and throw in with the eggplant.<BR>
7.  Add remaining ingredients and blend into a paste.<BR>
8.  salt to taste<BR>
<BR>
Now, remember that pan from the broiler which you lined with foil? Don't<BR>
throw that juice out. Drink it or add it to the babaganoush. It is really<BR>
tasty.<BR>
<BR>
This looks like a lot of work, but it really isn't. And besides, you just<BR>
made enough for several meals!<BR>
        Enjoy,<BR>
          Steve<BR>

Hi,<BR>
I forgot to mention that you can make the same recipe substituting cooked<BR>
winter squash for the eggplant. I've never tried this, and I don't know if<BR>
the peppers would still go, but it would be less trouble, and also maybe<BR>
you can't eat eggplant yet.<BR>

&gt;My body, also, is very, very sensitive and I have had very similar reaction<BR>

&gt;the weekend, I beefed up my intake of vegetables I tolerate and noticed<BR>
&gt;this morning in getting up that my legs were not &quot;rubbery&quot; and I didn't<BR>

&gt;avacado?  I can tolerate grape juice only ... if I cut it with water by<BR>
&gt;half, and grapes are very high in carbs.  I usually take it as a &quot;snack&quot;.<BR>
&gt;If the banana is very ripe, I'm okay, otherwise...D.  So, you and I will<BR>

Dear Prateeksha and Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
  I don't know why, but it feels so good to hear that I am not alone with<BR>
my experiences.  Avacado is a solid stand-by for me, too!  Same with grape<BR>
juice, cut with water.  I've worried about not getting a varied enough<BR>
diet, but when I listen...really listen...to the reaction of my body, I<BR>
feel a lot better about taking it slowly.<BR>
<BR>
  Thank you for sharing.  Best of health to you.  Carolyn<BR>
<BR>
PS...Just writing to you all on this subject of getting more carbohydrates<BR>
made me realize I just needed to be more creative with what I -can-<BR>
tolerate.  I experimented with a butternut squash snack by making like a<BR>
pumpkin pie filling.  It's great, and helps keep my energy up.  :)<BR>

Dear Roberta,<BR>
I used to have problems with the yogurt, until I switched to Yogourmet<BR>
powdered starter. I use a Yogourmet electric yogurt maker, and I let it go<BR>
at least 30 hours. I can now eat yogurt morning, noon, and night, without<BR>
any trouble. I almost always make it with the 1/2 &amp; 1/2. <BR>
Do you have problems with cheese? Cheese agreed with me from day one.<BR>
Good luck.<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; Hello everyone,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I've been on the diet now for over a year and have never been able to<BR>
&gt; tolerate the Yoghurt and I know with all the good advice about making it,<BR>
I<BR>
&gt; have been following the instructions precisely.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I would like to know if there is anybody out there who once had a problem<BR>
&gt; with Yoghurt and got over it after a few months on the diet.  Would it be<BR>
&gt; worthwhile to try it again?  Has Elaine ever commented on this?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks for any input.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Best wishes<BR>
&gt; <BR>

Dear Ellen, <BR>
I found the Foley food mill at a store that carried a lot of canning<BR>
supplies, since it's often used for removing seeds to make berry jams and<BR>
jellies. <BR>

The Chicken Divan recipe that jcorless sent in is especially good in<BR>
leftover form (cold). I brought some with me on a weekend trip and it was a<BR>
real treat. Since it has the chicken and broccoli, it makes a convenient<BR>
meal when away from home. <BR>

I believe cream of tartar is OK for the SCD diet.  I have made little apple<BR>
pies using it:  cut up your apples and simmer with honey and cinnamon.<BR>
Then dish up in little pyrex custard cups.  Make meringue (whip egg whites,<BR>
a little honey and some cream of tartar until stiff peaks form).  Spoon the<BR>
meringue on top of apples, sealing to the sides of the custard cups.  Bake<BR>
at 325 or 350 (look in your regular cookbook under meringue pies) for 10-15<BR>
min. until meringue turns golden.  They are delicious and fun to eat and<BR>
they look real pretty!<BR>

<BR>
I'm pretty sure that cream has lactose in it and is not allowed.  It can <BR>
be used for making yogurt, however.<BR>
Also homemade tartar sauce might be okay, but I imagine most store <BR>
bought brands would have sugar or starch in them, similar to mayonaise.<BR>
<BR>
Xantham gum is not allowed because it is a polysaccharide.  Juices that <BR>
say &quot;all natural&quot; may still have sugar added so be sure to read the <BR>
ingredients.  Juices that say &quot;100% pure&quot; or &quot;no sugar added&quot; are <BR>
usually okay.  I'm pretty sure that concentrated juice is okay.  Jams <BR>
are not allowed because of their pectin content, regardless of whether <BR>
they are &quot;all fruit&quot; or not.  There is a recipe for jam in the book, but <BR>
I have never tried it myself.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;199709111418.JAA18915@b01d04.exu.ericsson.se&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I don't know if anyone is interested, but I wanted to share the<BR>
story about my first experience making yoghurt.<BR>
<BR>
I used:<BR>
<BR>
1) A Salton yogurt maker<BR>
2) 4 cups of 1/2 and 1/2<BR>
3) 1 cup of whole milk plain yogurt (as starter)<BR>
<BR>
I cooked it for 36 hours.<BR>
<BR>
The result?  The thickest, richest yogurt I ever saw.  It's so<BR>
thick, it's almost solid.  I hope I made it right.  I just doubled<BR>
Elaine's french cream recipe.   It's not sweet by any stretch of the<BR>
imagination, but for someone who's been off of sugar and dairy for<BR>
over a year, it was pure heaven!  It tastes like a cross between<BR>
yogurt and sour cream.<BR>
<BR>
The status:  No immediate reaction (colon-wise).  I'll give it 24-<BR>
hours to see if there's any sort of delayed reaction.  If not, I'm<BR>
the happiest Crohnie around today.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks everyone for the hints and tips on yogurt making.<BR>
<BR>

Hi, I've had numbing/tingling in several of my fingers (especially in<BR>
the left hand) on and off for the last year.  I believe mine started<BR>
when I used Flagyl (metronidazole) for my CD.  I have taken 12-15<BR>
courses of Flagyl over the last two years.  I try not to take it<BR>
at all now (even though it's always helped me with flare-ups).<BR>

&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well, I looked around the web and came up with a downloadable nutrition<BR>
&gt; program.  It's designed so that you can plan your menus and it will tally up<BR>
&gt; the calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein.  The demo program which is<BR>
&gt; downloadable only has a limited number of foods (600 I think--evidently the<BR>
&gt; full program has 8000 foods).  I just browsed the demo program and picked out<BR>
&gt; the ones that were relevant to the diet.  I'm pretty sure the place I<BR>
&gt; downloaded it from is:<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; ftp://ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/food/ngcrd45.zip<BR>
&gt; It was interesting to play around with.  I made up a sample day's menus that<BR>
&gt; would comply with SCD and it had 180% of the protein required, 180% of the<BR>
&gt; fat, 120% of the calories, and only 80% of the carbohydrates.  (This is<BR>
&gt; relative to the RDA based on age, sex, weight, activity level).  Anyway, it<BR>
&gt; was interesting.  I know that they sell &quot;carbohydrate counters&quot;--small books<BR>
&gt; that list the carbohydrate values in foods--but this was an easy shortcut<BR>
&gt; that didn't require a trip to the bookstore.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think that those who want to gain weight on this diet will need to keep<BR>
&gt; their carbs up, and that those who might have weight to lose would want to<BR>
&gt; minimize them.  Honey appears to be the easiest way to add carbs (or cut them<BR>
&gt; back) since it is packed with carbs (17 g per Tablespoon), and can optionally<BR>
&gt; be added or deleted in yogurt shakes, muffins, etc.<BR>

&gt;&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I'm  wondering the same thing!   On August 21, Ellen gave such a<BR>
&gt;&gt; breakdown<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  by the cup, no less, of a few foods in our diet, and I am indeed<BR>
&gt;&gt; interested<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  to learn how she came up with this very vital information?! &gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, I looked around the web and came up with a downloadable<BR>
&gt;&gt; nutrition<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; program.  It's designed so that you can plan your menus and it will<BR>
&gt;&gt; tally up<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein.  The demo program<BR>
&gt;&gt; which is<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; downloadable only has a limited number of foods (600 I<BR>
&gt;&gt; think--evidently the<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; full program has 8000 foods).  I just browsed the demo program and<BR>
&gt;&gt; picked out<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the ones that were relevant to the diet.  I'm pretty sure the place<BR>
&gt;&gt; I<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; downloaded it from is:<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ftp://ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/food/ngcrd45.zip<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; It was interesting to play around with.  I made up a sample day's<BR>
&gt;&gt; menus that<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; would comply with SCD and it had 180% of the protein required, 180%<BR>
&gt;&gt; of the<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; fat, 120% of the calories, and only 80% of the carbohydrates.  (This<BR>
&gt;&gt; is<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; relative to the RDA based on age, sex, weight, activity level).<BR>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, it<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; was interesting.  I know that they sell &quot;carbohydrate<BR>
&gt;&gt; counters&quot;--small books<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that list the carbohydrate values in foods--but this was an easy<BR>
&gt;&gt; shortcut<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; that didn't require a trip to the bookstore.<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think that those who want to gain weight on this diet will need to<BR>
&gt;&gt; keep<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; their carbs up, and that those who might have weight to lose would<BR>
&gt;&gt; want to<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; minimize them.  Honey appears to be the easiest way to add carbs (or<BR>
&gt;&gt; cut them<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; back) since it is packed with carbs (17 g per Tablespoon), and can<BR>
&gt;&gt; optionally<BR>
&gt;&gt; &gt; be added or deleted in yogurt shakes, muffins, etc.<BR>

&lt;&lt; Finally, does anyone know how to substitute the almond flour for regular<BR>
 flours, for example: does 1c. plain flour = 1c. almond flour?<BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I have very little experience with it (I've only been on the diet a few<BR>
weeks) but when I adapt a recipe I try to account for the fact that the<BR>
almond flour is about 60% oil.  I try to reduce the overall fat in the recipe<BR>
to account for this.  This often means leaving out the butter in a baking<BR>
recipe.  So far, results have been good.  I think the most challenging aspect<BR>
of baking with this diet is that you have no truly dry ingredients--so it's<BR>
easy for things to end up soggy/oily.  <BR>
<BR>
Oh...and the honey.  Try substituting honey for sugar in less than 1:1 ratio.<BR>
 Honey is sweeter and can easily be cloying.  Substitute honey for sugar by<BR>
using 80% of the volume called for, and reduce the liquids a bit (eliminate<BR>
1/4 c. of liquid for each cup of honey used).<BR>

&gt; Hi Ellen,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Try as I may, I was not able to reach the web site you reference<BR>

&gt;<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;site&quot;   ftp://ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/food/ngcrd45.zip   is<BR>
actually a file that you can download.  Please note that there is no<BR>
&quot;www or http, but rather an &quot;ftp&quot; which stands for &quot;file transfer<BR>
protocol.  You can download this file to your hard drive, decompress it<BR>
and then read it.<BR>
<BR>
PS  I apologize for the link to the site on carburators, (get it..<BR>
carbs?) I am naturally very prone to inappropriate silliness. I too am<BR>
feeling &quot;hassled&quot; by all the messages I have to go through, and<BR>
understand the need to keep the message board focused on the diet and<BR>
not to veer off unnecessarily.  I guess in my case, I am feeling so good<BR>
lately that I'm starting to get a bit loopy.   I will exercise the<BR>
upmost restraint when I get future silly urges, particularly relative to<BR>
this important service.<BR>

In a message dated 97-09-10 06:53:25 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; is fibromyali and Fibro Myalgia the same disease ? &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
There is a disease called &quot;Fibromyalgia&quot;.  The three terms you use in your<BR>
posts would appear to be variations on that: Fibromyalia, fibromyali, and<BR>
Fibro Myalgia.  I wonder if you picked those up from people who had trouble<BR>
spelling/typing Fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia used to be known as Fibrositis,<BR>
and is sometimes called &quot;fibromyositis&quot; (according to the medical<BR>
dictionary).  Neither fibromyalia, nor fibromyali are listed in the medical<BR>
dictionary.  Fibro Myalgia is listed in it's parts:  Fibro meaning fibrous<BR>
tissue, and Myalgia meaning pain in the muscles.  Taken together, it's<BR>
Fibromyalgia.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, these may exist and just not be listed in my medical<BR>
dictionary (Webster's).  I just noticed that ulcerative colitis is listed but<BR>
crohns is not!<BR>
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.<BR>

Hello &amp; thanks to all who answered my questions,<BR>
<BR>
I have tried several of the book's recipes with varying results. The<BR>
basic nut muffins &amp; the stir fry came out great. The zucchini pizza<BR>
crust &amp; the almond honey crisps were awful.<BR>
<BR>
Possibly the problem with the pizza was that I used frozen,thawed grated<BR>
zucchini. I will use fresh next time. The crisps were just a runny,<BR>
soupy mess that my husband used as an ice cream topping. Any<BR>
suggestions?<BR>
<BR>
I'm wondering if the consistency of home-ground nut flour and bought<BR>
flour is that big of a diff. I almost cried at the waste of it. Here in<BR>
NC, almonds are $7.99/lb. and I lost half of what I had in the &quot;bad&quot;<BR>
recipes. Could this be what went wrong?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

Hi group,<BR>
<BR>
Well seems that staying up late has price to it.<BR>
<BR>
The last three nights I've stayed up 'till midnight making SCD<BR>
food. This includes 2 weeks supply of soup, 3-4 weeks of hamburgers,<BR>
cheese cake, home-made grape jello, yogurt, and last night the<BR>
date-filled cookies (without the dates).  Well, last night we<BR>
had a visitor until 11pm and I still wanted to make my cookies<BR>
after since I was taking Friday off from work.  After putting in<BR>
my 3rd batch (2 dozen at a time) of cookies, I went downstairs to<BR>
watch TV.  Twoo hours later I realized that I had fallen asleep<BR>
and there was a funny smell in the house.  I burnt my cookies !<BR>
What a waste :(<BR>
<BR>
I am sure many of you can relate to this !<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>
