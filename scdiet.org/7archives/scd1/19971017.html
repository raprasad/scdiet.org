I would love it if we could get Elaine to comment as she has studied the<BR>
effects of food on the intestine.  I would love to know if she thinks<BR>
food combining is bunk!<BR>
<BR>
It occured to me that fruit, no matter when, and with what you eat it,<BR>
will move through the intestines at the rate of the slowest moving meal<BR>
that you ate.  So if you eat something the takes a long time to digest,<BR>
and it is in you  intestines, then you eat fruit, it will still only<BR>
move through at the rate of the previous meal you ate.<BR>
<BR>
As I said previously, I am experimenting and so far have not found<BR>
myself bloating etc.  I wonder if the issue is really eating ANY kind of<BR>
food with complex carbos like bread.  I know, that I know, if I eat a<BR>
tuna fish sandwich, that the bread is going to cause me lots of<BR>
problems!  If I eat bread by itself, I am going to have problems.  I'll<BR>
bet if I eat a bannana sandwich, I would feel real bad!!  Perhaps fruit<BR>
has gotten a bum rap because people usually eat complex carbos with it,<BR>
bloat like crazy and blame the fruit!!  It is a theory anyway.  Any<BR>
experts wish to comment?  Elaine??<BR>

&gt; Pat,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; What a coincidence that you brought up the food combination issue.  I<BR>
&gt; was<BR>
&gt; just thinking the same thing when I read about eating fruit with<BR>
&gt; yougurt or<BR>
&gt; cheese.  According to books such as Fit For Life, and other ones I<BR>
&gt; read,<BR>
&gt; fruit should be eaten alone on an empty stomach 30 min. before a meal<BR>
&gt; or 4-6<BR>
&gt; hours after a protein or starch meal.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Like you said, the fruit requires minimal time to digest (20-45<BR>
&gt; minutes:dried<BR>
&gt; fruit and bananas take 45 minutes) while proteins take about 4 hours.<BR>
&gt;  According to the literature, fruit that becomes trapped with other<BR>
&gt; food in<BR>
&gt; the stomach begins to ferment, potentially causing the entire contents<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; putrify and cause gas and bloating.  OK, I know some of us can do<BR>
&gt; without the<BR>
&gt; excess gas ad bloating.  Also, according the these authors, improper<BR>
&gt; food<BR>
&gt; combination can cause havoc on the digestive system and wear it down<BR>
&gt; along<BR>
&gt; with destroying the integrity of the food by fermenting it or causing<BR>
&gt; it to<BR>
&gt; putrify.  So, what quality of nutrients are we absorbing then?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I found that when I used to eat fruit at meals I used to develop<BR>
&gt; terrible<BR>
&gt; stomach aches which mistakenly I blamed the fruit and became afraid to<BR>
&gt; eat<BR>
&gt; them.  After I found out about food combination, I ate fruit alone<BR>
&gt; with no<BR>
&gt; problem.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Fruit also helps cleanse the intestines, and sometimes fruit reacts<BR>
&gt; with<BR>
&gt; remaining intestinal and stomach debris and cause some bloating.<BR>
&gt; Otherwise<BR>
&gt; there should be no problem.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; My question is, if so many nutritionists who study the effects of food<BR>
&gt; on the<BR>
&gt; digestive system individually state the same thing about food<BR>
&gt; combination,<BR>
&gt; then why hasn't Elaine mention it?  I know we don't have to be<BR>
&gt; concerned<BR>
&gt; about combining starch with protein, but I am a little bit concerned<BR>
&gt; about<BR>
&gt; fruit and other foods.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Those of you who read the recipes I posted noticed they are all from<BR>
&gt; the Fit<BR>
&gt; For Life Cookbook.  All the fruit-based deserts contain nothing but<BR>
&gt; fruit,<BR>
&gt; nuts, seeds, honey, and nut milks which are digestively compatible.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Any take on this?  If anyone disagrees, remember I am just the<BR>
&gt; messenger, so<BR>
&gt; don't kill ME.<BR>

Good point about &quot;The Zone&quot;.  No food combining issues there.  Other<BR>
books I've read give no mention of it either.  Don't you just hate<BR>
uncertainty?  Elaine, where are you??<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; Ever since Pat posted that great question about combining fruit etc.,<BR>
&gt; I've<BR>
&gt; been waiting to see what you all had to say.  Does someone save<BR>
&gt; difficult<BR>
&gt; questions and then give them to Elaine all at once instead of calling<BR>
&gt; her<BR>
&gt; individually? My 2 cents.  About a year ago I read &quot;The Zone&quot;  have<BR>
&gt; sinced<BR>
&gt; loaned it to a friend and don't have it to refer to, but I have seen<BR>
&gt; it<BR>
&gt; mentioned here before.  The author, Barry Sears, combines a protein,<BR>
&gt; carbo,<BR>
&gt; and fat in specific ratios to each other at every meal and snack. This<BR>
&gt; regulates insulin levels, controls free radicals, etc. and is<BR>
&gt; described as a<BR>
&gt; steady drip (like and IV) of food throughout the day. I don't ever<BR>
&gt; remember<BR>
&gt; in the book advice on eating fruit separate, just in proportion to the<BR>
&gt; protein and fat.  I find I have a problem if I eat too much fruit,<BR>
&gt; which I<BR>
&gt; think there is a tendency to do, because we don't eat junk food and<BR>
&gt; fruit<BR>
&gt; seems &quot;legal&quot;.  I know we've been told to basically put blinders on<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; follow the SCD which I'm prepared to do, but we all have read and been<BR>
&gt; taught<BR>
&gt; other nutritional theories and sometimes it's just hard to blank that<BR>
&gt; out of<BR>
&gt; your mind.  Take care, Jane<BR>

<BR>
Jane,<BR>
<BR>
I am also familiar with Barry Sears.  I have both of his books.  And to make<BR>
things more confusing than they already are, what he says makes sense too.<BR>
<BR>
I have tried to incorporate what he advises ( 40% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and<BR>
30% protein combination).  I eyeball everything, because weighing food and<BR>
counting grams sounds too neurotic to me.  <BR>
<BR>
Can I put my 2 cents in?<BR>
<BR>
Anyone can use what ever method they feel more comfortable with.  Someone who<BR>
has no problem with combining fruit with other food can ignore what the Fit<BR>
For Life says.  If anyone feel The Zone sounds like the right food<BR>
combination to follow, can eat protein and vegetables (or nut breads) in the<BR>
proper proportions, which is 2:1 ratio of vegetable to protein in volume.<BR>
 Or, like myself, usually do both.  I just eat fruit by themselves as snacks.<BR>
 This way, I figure,  if at least one of the 2 is right, I am covered.  If it<BR>
turns out they are both wrong, I have nothing to loose.  I still eat well.<BR>
<BR>
Bottom line is, the only diet I follow religiously is the SCD diet.  The<BR>
other concepts can be easily incorporated into this diet if anyone chooses to<BR>
follow them.  So far nothing seems to hurt.  And if it doesn't work for<BR>
someone, at least he or she hasn't fallen of the wagon with the SCD diet.<BR>
<BR>
What do you, and the rest of the group think?<BR>

Hi Jeff,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I need some support/advice. I=92ve been on SCD for about 3 weeks now.<BR>
&gt; Although I saw clear improvement the first 3 days, I have not seen any<BR>
&gt; more since.<BR>
<BR>
From your message, I see that you are eating too many foods too early<BR>
in the diet since you still have diarreah.  These include nut flour<BR>
(which is irritating),  black tea (wait till later), cooked vegetables<BR>
or *cooked* fruit (can add to problem right now), chili-type stew<BR>
(probably too spicy -- avoid spices for now, and you are probably using<BR>
tomatoes --wait), raw nuts (more irritating than nut flour), raisins<BR>
also wait).<BR>
<BR>
Even though these are all allowed on the diet, it does not mean they are<BR>
ok for your system in the beginning of the SCD diet.  They should only be<BR>
introduced once the D. (6-10/day) is practically gone and you are having<BR>
some normal BM.<BR>
<BR>
I have been on for 4 months now.  I never introduced nut flour until<BR>
6-8 weeks (muffins and cookies). I tried cheese and eggs in the beginning<BR>
but found they caused problems, so I recently re-introduced them (at 10-14<BR>
weeks) and now it is ok.  Although I used eggs and honey in the cheesecake<BR>
recipe, this did not seem to bother me. Ripe bananas (black spots) has only<BR>
been about 3-4 weeks to add to my yogurt.  My first cooked vegetables<BR>
(beyond the carrots in the soup) were the spaghetti squash and zuchini<BR>
(a squash).  Squash is the first veggie we feed babies since it is easiest<BR>
on their immature digestive systems (so good for our irritated bowels). <BR>
I have still not introduced tomato juice.  The book says wait 6 months<BR>
for raw nuts and I think also raisins.<BR>
<BR>
So even though others on the list admitted to eating some of the above<BR>
foods right away on the diet, they probably did not have much D. to deal<BR>
with and their situation was not as bad as yours.  ONLY INTRODUCE NEW<BR>
FOODS ONE AT A TIME for a 2-3 days and see how your body reacts.  If ok,<BR>
then you can include it into your daily allowable foods.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Will the homemade yogurt contribute positively?<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I would say the homemade yogurt is important.<BR>
<BR>
My bloating and cramping went away within the first couple of weeks as I<BR>
stuck to the very basic diet.  I used to take Pepcid AC every night for<BR>
the heartburn, however I have never taken any since the first day on SCD.<BR>
<BR>
Before I started the diet in June, I had lost 10 pounds in 4-5 months<BR>
(not good).  My GI wanted me to start tube-feeding myself at night (yes<BR>
that means I had to insert the tube nasally by myself).  Of course this<BR>
was not an option in my view, so I committed to the SCD diet.  Three<BR>
months later, my GI says &quot;good... so see me in three months&quot;.  I think<BR>
that comment speaks for itself.  Stick with it, it takes time.  Don't<BR>
expect a miracle cure overnight.  The end result is worth it.<BR>
<BR>
Of course this is my opinion based on my experiences.<BR>
<BR>
P.S. Raman, how is that for a testimonial :)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Jeff...welcome...<BR>
<BR>
Black Tea?  That has caffeine in it and is a no-no.  Herbal only,<BR>
preferably spearmint or peppermint (per Elaine in the book).<BR>
<BR>
Raw Nuts?  Elaine says no nuts (except nut flour) until all diarrhea has<BR>
cleared.  (I'm on the diet 4 months as of yesterday and I'm still waiting!)<BR>
<BR>
Salad?  Raw veggies are difficult for some people and can cause the<BR>
diarrhea to persist.  I haven't eaten any raw veggies since starting the<BR>
diet because I still have the diarrhea; however, I am down to no more than<BR>
2 bm's in the morning so there has been a big improvement.<BR>
<BR>
Raisins can cause loose stools; if diarrhea is persistent, I'd not include<BR>
them in my diet.<BR>
<BR>
I am only eating raw banana and then only when it has brown spots;<BR>
otherwise, I cook the fruit and don't have it very often.  I think it<BR>
contributes to my diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
So, these are my hints.  Hope they are helpful.  Hang in there.  It takes a<BR>
good while for the intestines to heal; I know.  But, it is happening for<BR>
me, and if you are painstakingly careful with your diet (re-read the book<BR>
several times...I see something I have missed in prior readings each time)<BR>
you will begin to see improvement.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,<BR>

&gt;Although I saw clear<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;I=92ll furnish you with my eating habits (I=92ll be brief) as this may have<BR>
&gt;clues for you.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Mornings: Nut flour bread/ muffins (made with cashew and almond ) black<BR>
&gt;tea and honey.<BR>
&gt;Note: I=92m waiting for yogurtmet to arrive, so I have not had any yogurt<BR>
&gt;thus far.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Lunch: chicken or beef dish, with some cooked vegetable.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Dinner: Same as lunch, or fish, or chili-type stew, sometimes with<BR>
&gt;salad.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Snacks: apple or banana during cousre of day. At inception of diet I ate<BR>
&gt;more raw nuts and<BR>
&gt;raisin combo, less so now.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Some days are better than others. Still loose diarrhea BM's in the<BR>
&gt;majority (about 6 is a =93good=94 day, 10 on =93bad=94 day), bleeding=<BR>
 appears to<BR>
&gt;minimal. More cramping/bloating than actual pain, but this is really not<BR>
&gt;too bothersome.  I am able to function fairly normally, i.e. I go to<BR>
&gt;work, work-out at gym, and maintain myself without any problems except<BR>
&gt;the =93inconvenience=94 of the above mentioned items.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am not taking any medication.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So--Any counsel out there? Any =93been-there-done-that=92s=94 out there. Do=<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;I feel my enthusiam waning with each day that I don=92t perceive<BR>

One other thing, Jeff, I forgot to mention:<BR>
<BR>
In the first 3 months of the Diet, I had to be very careful about mixing<BR>
foods; had to keep it very simple.  For instance:  carrots.  In the<BR>
beginning, I'd steam them or bake them without even butter and no herbs<BR>
(too complex) and now in the last month, have started adding butter and a<BR>
little dried parsley flakes.  At first, I'd just steam a little eggplant.<BR>
Now, I saute mushrooms and a tiny bit of onion with the eggplant.  So,<BR>
adding more ingredients in one dish, makes it more complicated for the<BR>
digestive system to handle.  That's what we have to be careful of, those of<BR>
us with diarrhea.<BR>

Subject: Food combining &amp; the SCD<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;34475C77.7A0BF9B1@emory.edu&gt;<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;...My question is, if so many nutritionists who study the effects of<BR>
food on the<BR>
digestive system individually state the same thing about food<BR>
combination,<BR>
then why hasn't Elaine mention it?  I know we don't have to be concerned<BR>
<BR>
about combining starch with protein, but I am a little bit concerned<BR>
about<BR>
fruit and other foods...&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I have wondered the same.  I've tried the fit-for-life diet before I'd<BR>
discovered the SCD, at a time when I was in a long remission from CD.  I<BR>
found that it increased my energy.  I believe that Elaine's diet is<BR>
based upon her research as a microbiologist, and her research on Dr.<BR>
Haas.  Her book is an effort to bring this breakthrough diet into the<BR>
mainstream.  Perhaps she hasn't wanted to dilute her findings with other<BR>
theories, although related to health, not specific to curing IBD'ers.  I<BR>
have no basis for suspecting that Elaine would agree with the &quot;fruit&quot;<BR>
combining aspects which aren't essential to the SCD.  If you are smart<BR>
(which you are or you wouldn't be here) you will do what works for you!<BR>
I &quot;forgot&quot; about the fruit business, ate ribs and apples last night, and<BR>
expect that my coworkers won't be happy campers today (fugure it out)!<BR>
So, I hope I can incorporate this &quot;habit&quot; to avoid fruit during or after<BR>
eating anything else on the SCD.  It's just a matter of timing, dosen't<BR>
mean I have to give up anyting else.<BR>
<BR>
I was wondering, though, if perhaps the SCD is really a food combining<BR>
thing.  Maybe we CAN eat starches, carbos, etc, but NOT with proteins.<BR>
Maybe it is the combining that is irritating our stomachs, or preventing<BR>
the proper breaking down, or absorption of the carbs.  Anyone willing to<BR>
be the guinnea pig and try eating starches by themselves and see it they<BR>
get sicker?  (I'm NOT!)  Just wondering....<BR>

I think you have a good attitude!  I'm starting to find that following the<BR>
SCD diet still leaves plenty of room for the dieter to interpret how the<BR>
allowable foods should be put together.  I know it would get lengthy, but I<BR>
would be interested in examples of how others eat daily, especially for the<BR>
beginning.  One question - I love almond nut butter sold in the health food<BR>
store.  The only ingredient is roasted almonds, but because they are roasted,<BR>
is that illegal?  It's great with banana and a comforting, filling  snack.<BR>
  Take care, Jane<BR>

I attempted to treat my GI flare ups over the past 10 years with the<BR>
Candida Diet, which rather rapidly allows things like yeast free breads,<BR>
rice, ricecakes, store bought Yoghurt etc.  Can't have fruit really at<BR>
all at any time on that diet until after all symptoms are basically<BR>
gone.<BR>
<BR>
After only about 20 days, I can attest unequivocally, at least for me,<BR>
that SCD works and Candida Diet does not.  I know a lot of people with<BR>
alledged Candida problems who did not progress at all on the Candida<BR>
Diet.  I think it simply misses the underlying problem of why Microbes<BR>
have an opportunity to hurt the GI tract in the first place- the bodies<BR>
inability to digest complex sugars.  <BR>
<BR>
Their theory is that Complex is better cause the microbes have a harder<BR>
time breaking these down for their food, but simple sugars really &quot;feed&quot;<BR>
the candida.  Comparing my 20 days on SCD to the months and months on<BR>
the Candida Diet with very difficult, painful progress,  is just no<BR>
comparison.  I feel I have proven to at least myself (and my wife), that<BR>
the truth is that eating simple sugars feeds us, and eating complex<BR>
carbo's feed the bad guys and ends up huting us!<BR>
<BR>
So in response to you offer to try our something different than SCD<BR>
where &quot;food combining&quot; with starches etc is ok,  NO THANKS.  Been<BR>
there...<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt;...My question is, if so many nutritionists who study the effects of<BR>
&gt; food on the<BR>
&gt; digestive system individually state the same thing about food<BR>
&gt; combination,<BR>
&gt; then why hasn't Elaine mention it?  I know we don't have to be<BR>
&gt; concerned<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; about combining starch with protein, but I am a little bit concerned<BR>
&gt; about<BR>
&gt; fruit and other foods...&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have wondered the same.  I've tried the fit-for-life diet before I'd<BR>
&gt; discovered the SCD, at a time when I was in a long remission from CD.<BR>
&gt; I<BR>
&gt; found that it increased my energy.  I believe that Elaine's diet is<BR>
&gt; based upon her research as a microbiologist, and her research on Dr.<BR>
&gt; Haas.  Her book is an effort to bring this breakthrough diet into the<BR>
&gt; mainstream.  Perhaps she hasn't wanted to dilute her findings with<BR>
&gt; other<BR>
&gt; theories, although related to health, not specific to curing IBD'ers.<BR>
&gt; I<BR>
&gt; have no basis for suspecting that Elaine would agree with the &quot;fruit&quot;<BR>
&gt; combining aspects which aren't essential to the SCD.  If you are smart<BR>
&gt; (which you are or you wouldn't be here) you will do what works for<BR>
&gt; you!<BR>
&gt; I &quot;forgot&quot; about the fruit business, ate ribs and apples last night,<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; expect that my coworkers won't be happy campers today (fugure it out)!<BR>
&gt; So, I hope I can incorporate this &quot;habit&quot; to avoid fruit during or<BR>
&gt; after<BR>
&gt; eating anything else on the SCD.  It's just a matter of timing,<BR>
&gt; dosen't<BR>
&gt; mean I have to give up anyting else.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I was wondering, though, if perhaps the SCD is really a food combining<BR>
&gt; thing.  Maybe we CAN eat starches, carbos, etc, but NOT with proteins.<BR>
&gt; Maybe it is the combining that is irritating our stomachs, or<BR>
&gt; preventing<BR>
&gt; the proper breaking down, or absorption of the carbs.  Anyone willing<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; be the guinnea pig and try eating starches by themselves and see it<BR>
&gt; they<BR>
&gt; get sicker?  (I'm NOT!)  Just wondering....<BR>

<BR>
Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I have questions concerning these three items:<BR>
<BR>
1) Water Chestnuts - does anyone know if these are permissible?  In<BR>
Elaine's book she says<BR>
      that Watercress is but doen's mention Water Chestnuts.<BR>
<BR>
2) Cornstarch - if one was to 'adapt' a recipe to the SCD and it called for<BR>
cornstarch as a thickener<BR>
    what would you use instead?<BR>
<BR>
3) Soy sauce - again, in an effort to adapt a recipe to the SCD that<BR>
originally called for 1/4 c. soy sauce,<BR>
     any suggestions on what to use in it's place?<BR>
<BR>
If anyone has some ideas, please let me know. I'll try them out and if the<BR>
adapted recipe is near as good<BR>
as the original I will share the recipe with the group.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
Linda<BR>

In Bill's response to Kay - right on Bill. I would have been dead by now had<BR>
it not been for colemas and further more, whether ANY of the people on the<BR>
scd diet want to admit it or not, this is exactly what they probably need.<BR>
the gut MUST be cleaned out before ANY pathogen is going to be dealt with.<BR>
healing the gut and cleaning the gut are two different things. if you heal<BR>
the gut and dont clean, i dont know how anyone can get well. if you clean the<BR>
gut and dont heal will promote the same outcome.<BR>

If anyone wants to read further about a detox method using enemas (among<BR>
other things), try to get a hold of &quot;The Gerson Primer&quot; &amp; &quot;A Cancer<BR>
Therapy&quot;, about a protocol used by The Gerson Institute (run by the wife &amp;<BR>
son of a now-dead 1930-1960's US physician, Max Gerson).  1/800-838-2256 or<BR>
(619) 267-6441  or POBBox 430  Bonita CA  91908.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;Primer&quot; is about $25, and describes in detail the protocol they use in<BR>
their clinic (unfortunately, in Mexico) for people who either can't afford<BR>
it there, are too ill to travel, or simply want to do it on their own.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;A Cancer Therapy&quot; describes the travails of Max Gerson MD and his<BR>
fights with the medical &quot;establishment&quot;.  The full title is &quot;A Cancer<BR>
Therapy: Results of 50 cases, and the Cure of Advanced Cancer by Diet<BR>
Therapy, a Summary of 30 years of clinical experimentation&quot; (whew!  how's<BR>
that for a long title!?)<BR>

&gt;I need some support/advice. I=92ve been on SCD for about 3 weeks now.=20<BR>
&gt;Although I saw clear<BR>
&gt; improvement the first 3 days, I have not seen any more since.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I=92ll furnish you with my eating habits (I=92ll be brief) as this may h=<BR>

&gt;clues for you.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Mornings: Nut flour bread/ muffins (made with cashew and almond ) black<BR>
&gt;tea and honey.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'd say black tea is a definite no-no: the caffeine &amp; theobromine &amp; other<BR>
alkaloids in it are definitely not to be advised in colitis, I'd say.<BR>
<BR>
In severe periods, honey may also be a good idea to give up.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Note: I=92m waiting for yogurtmet to arrive, so I have not had any yogur=<BR>
t<BR>
&gt;thus far.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Lunch: chicken or beef dish, with some cooked vegetable.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Do you add soya sauce (which usually contains wheat), or MSG-type stuff t=<BR>
o<BR>
the &quot;dish&quot;?  How do you make your lunch tasty?<BR>
<BR>
Try focusing, during this acute phase, on pureed cooked vegetables, and g=<BR>
o<BR>
back to reading about which vegetables to use (e.g. avoid starchy ones li=<BR>
ke<BR>
corn and potato, right?  People sometimes forget these basic points)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Dinner: Same as lunch, or fish, or chili-type stew, sometimes with<BR>
&gt;salad.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
What's the chil/stew thickener?  corn starch?  wheat flour?<BR>
And again: what are the spices you use?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Snacks: apple or banana during cousre of day. At inception of diet I ate<BR>
&gt;more raw nuts and=20<BR>
&gt;raisin combo, less so now.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Some days are better than others. Still loose diarrhea BM's in the<BR>
&gt;majority (about 6 is a =93good=94 day, 10 on =93bad=94 day),=20<BR>
<BR>
Hey, what are you beefing about?  That's not too bad at all.=20<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;bleeding appears to<BR>
&gt;minimal. More cramping/bloating than actual pain, but this is really not<BR>
&gt;too bothersome.  I am able to function fairly normally, i.e. I go to<BR>
&gt;work, work-out at gym, and maintain myself without any problems except<BR>
&gt;the =93inconvenience=94 of the above mentioned items.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am not taking any medication.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So--Any counsel out there? Any =93been-there-done-that=92s=94 out there.=<BR>
=20<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Are you drinking any carbonated bev's (i.e. soda pop / beer)?  Don't.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Do I<BR>
&gt;need to give it=20<BR>
&gt;more time?,  If so how long?, =20<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe Elaine says stick to it for 1 - 2 months &quot;fanatically&quot;, THEN<BR>
decide. =20<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Is this the normal process?=20<BR>
<BR>
There IS no normal process, from what I've noted via my friends,<BR>
acquaintances &amp; this list-group.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Will the<BR>

&gt;contribute positively?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I feel my enthusiam waning with each day that I don=92t perceive<BR>

&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Yeah, I know what you mean.  Here's an idea: set a deadline for your<BR>
decision, mark it in the calendar, so you'll have a clear time-goal to ai=<BR>
m<BR>

&gt;Before I started the diet I have had what I call pain in my ribs. So far no<BR>
&gt;doctor has diagnosed<BR>
&gt;what it is. A good friend of my said she experienced the same kind of<BR>
&gt;excrutiating pain and she<BR>
&gt;was diagnosed with an esophigal ulcer.  I don't have the pain all the time,<BR>
&gt;but I notice it when<BR>
&gt;I have been on my feet too long...like in the kitchen preparing all the<BR>
&gt;things for the SCD; or when<BR>
&gt;I wear too tight of clothing.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Does anybody else experience this or know what in the world it could be? I<BR>
&gt;don't know where to<BR>
&gt;start and/or whether the diet will also help this condition?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks<BR>

&gt;Yes, yes, I have this same exact pain.  Does it hurt you so bad that you<BR>
are literally rolling around in pain?  I have had this for the past 20<BR>
years, and yet no tests can identify what this pain is (and I've had them<BR>
all it seems like!)  The diet has helped me with my IBS (or Chrons, they're<BR>
not sure which...sigh), but I still get these attacks of pain about once or<BR>
twice a month.  When it's bad I keep taking Tylenol 3's every few hours<BR>
until the pain stops, it usually lasts about 8 hours before it lets up.  If<BR>
you or anybody on this list has a better solution re treatment or prevention<BR>
of these attacks, I would love to hear about it.<BR>

I have only been on SCD 20 days and I started slow and added some foods<BR>
a little too quickly and had to back off to basics too.  I do feel much,<BR>
much better though so hang in there.  Also, I did try to stop my diahrea<BR>
with Imodium and the D laughed at it.  Tried Pepto and my D had a field<BR>
day.  But to my great suprise, a product called Equalactin, which I<BR>
found in Smiths, a large grocery chain here, actually worked.  Just a<BR>
suggestion.  Might be worth a try.<BR>

So that's a couple of folks who've now said that they (surprisingly) felt<BR>
good when they did an occasional binge.<BR>
<BR>
Well, that's the odd thing that sometimes has happend to me &amp; my UC, too<BR>
... I'd &quot;sin&quot; (have some junk food, like ... gummy bears!  or anything with<BR>
sugar) and the next day have a &quot;paradox reaction&quot; (i.e. feel really well),<BR>
but the day AFTER that I'd be worse off.<BR>

I don't know WHAT the heck that weird pattern means, but if we had a<BR>

&gt;This is probably just coincidence, but during this last UC<BR>
&gt;flairup I can swear that I feel better the day after I eat any kind of<BR>
&gt;&quot;gummy candies&quot;. Gunny bears, gummy worms... I'm kind of a sugar<BR>
&gt;addict so if I go to the movies I basically eat most of the package by<BR>
&gt;myself.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So again, probably just coincidence but hey, if anybody is looking for<BR>
&gt;an alternative to all the healthy diet stuff suggested in this mailing<BR>
&gt;list, just go see a movie, binge on the gummy bears, and let me know<BR>
&gt;if that helps. (And no, I don't own stock in whoever makes gummy bears<BR>

&gt;I worried a lot for that week in preadvance with unknown toilets in<BR>
&gt;this unknown city and at the same time I couldnt help eating winegums<BR>

Dear M:<BR>
<BR>
That's an excellent question ... my naturopath said NEVER to combine<BR>
protein foods with starches: protein either by themselves or with<BR>
non-starchy veggies or with ACID fruits (i.e. grapefruit).<BR>
<BR>
Starches go with sweet (i.e. non-acid) fruits.<BR>
<BR>
Veggies go with all other groups (i.e. OK with proteins or with fruits or<BR>
with starches.<BR>
<BR>
That's what he says, anyway, and he's in his late 80's and spry as a young<BR>
kitten, even does headstands still!  (He showed me to prove it ... bit off<BR>
a show-off, he is!).<BR>
<BR>
		Dietmar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I was wondering, though, if perhaps the SCD is really a food combining<BR>
&gt;thing.  Maybe we CAN eat starches, carbos, etc, but NOT with proteins.<BR>
&gt;Maybe it is the combining that is irritating our stomachs, or preventing<BR>
&gt;the proper breaking down, or absorption of the carbs.  Anyone willing to<BR>
&gt;be the guinnea pig and try eating starches by themselves and see it they<BR>

You can get information about celiac disease, including what to eat, (which I<BR>
do not think is entirely correct) from<BR>
www.sfu.cal~jfremont/celiacresources.html  also a mailing list from -<BR>

As someone who suffers from some symptoms of hypoglycemia, I can say that<BR>
junk food will give you a temporary &quot;sugar high&quot;, especially when you haven't<BR>
had it in a while.  You will feel temporarily great, like an addict getting<BR>
drugs.  It can be very powerful and just as dangerous. The pancreas will put<BR>
out extra insulin and then a downward spiral can begin ( that feeling 2 days<BR>
later).  Treatment - high protein diet.  I'm no biochemist, obviously, but<BR>
that's my 2 cents!  Jane<BR>
P.S. If a person is healthy, than once in a while that's okay, but I find I<BR>
just crave more.  I'm sure that's what got me into this trouble.  Also<BR>
happens with eating carbos because they are readily turned into sugar. Have<BR>
you heard the term carbohydrate sensitivity? I think we all know that once<BR>
you go off this kind of food for a while you crave it less and less.  It is<BR>
amazing how people react when you tell them you don't eat sugar or bread,<BR>
they say &quot;I couldn't live without my bread, pasta, chocolate, etc.  I even<BR>
have a friend with severe UC that still won't read the book because she fears<BR>
life without pasta!  Food is a powerful drug!  <BR>

Message-ID: &lt;971018111525_1310570042@emout19.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi Guys!<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the diet faithfully for a month and a half.  It's made a huge<BR>
difference in my life.  It eliminated the bloating, pain, and lack of energy<BR>
that had induced my doctor to certify me as 80% disabled--permanently.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I am so thrilled with the results that I am not tempted to cheat and<BR>
am generally very careful.  But twice now I've had an intense reaction to<BR>
food served in a restaurant that I took as an indication that I had<BR>
accidently ingested an unallowed ingredient.  The thing is that since being<BR>
on the diet I seem to have become &quot;ultra sensitive&quot; to the unallowable<BR>
ingredients even though I didn't seem very sensitive to them before.  I'm<BR>
wondering (a) if others have had the same reaction and (b) if anyone has any<BR>
insight as to what I was reacting to.  I'll tell the story.<BR>
<BR>
In the first incident, a restaurant gave me a steak that had been marinated<BR>
in a pepper marinade (I had ordered plain).  Twenty minutes after I ate I was<BR>
doubled over with lower abdominal pain.  I worried I might need a bathroom.<BR>
 That night I was in a lot of pain.  The next two days I was quite ill.<BR>
 Bloating, diahrrea, pain, lack of energy.<BR>
<BR>
Last night I ate at a Morrocan restaurant.  They serve a 7 course feast.<BR>
 This is actually a place that I routinely eat at a few times a year.  When I<BR>
was the sickest, I often ate there with friends because I could lie down<BR>
while we all ate and socialized! (everyone lounges on sofas and pillow<BR>
there).  Another plus was that the food never bothered me--it was always a<BR>
&quot;safe&quot; place to eat.  (Food from that part of the world has always agreed<BR>
especially well with me, perhaps because they are the foods I was raised on.)<BR>
 I was careful about my selections and skipped a couple of courses entirely.<BR>
 Their food is simple and all prepared from fresh ingredients.  I had one<BR>
bite of the carrot salad and didn't have any more because the dressing seem a<BR>
bit sweet &amp; sour and I wondered whether there was sugar in it.  A couple<BR>
bites of the eggplant with olive oil, and a couple of bites of the<BR>
cucumber/tomato salad in oil &amp; vinegar.  I ate the chicken roasted with olive<BR>
oil, lemons, and olives.  I ate the lamb with honey and almonds.  At one<BR>
point they prepared fresh &quot;dolmas&quot; for me because they saw I couldn't eat<BR>
several of the courses.  I passed them around the table because they are<BR>
grape leaves filled with rice/chickpeas.  I did unwrap one of them, scraping<BR>
the grape leaf clean, and tasted just the grape leaf.  About 20 minutes after<BR>
I ate I got the same intense cramping and pain as I had from the marinade.  I<BR>
started to worry about how I would drive home in such a state.  Luckily it<BR>
subsided after a few minutes and I got home without incident.  Today I don't<BR>
feel too bad.  Just a little tired which isn't surprising or significant<BR>
after the week I've had.  So, the pain incident seems like it was a mild<BR>
reaction relative to the one I had to the marinade.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously I've learned my lesson about feeling overly comfortable with my<BR>
morrocan place.  Even though the full course menu never bothered me before,<BR>
it seems even a small bit of an illegal ingredient causes this intense pain<BR>
and cramping.<BR>
<BR>
I'm very curious if others have had this reaction to an illegal ingredient<BR>
and what the ingredient was.<BR>
<BR>
Ellen<BR>
<BR>
PS.  Yes, I know I shouldn't have even tasted the salads or taken liberties<BR>
with the grape leaf.  I remembered the salads as just being in a vinagerette,<BR>
and I felt badly that they had prepared something especially for me and felt<BR>
obligated to taste it.  I won't do that again.<BR>

*****  You're looking for a guinea pig?   <BR>
Well, a year ago I began following the Fit For Life food combination.  Back<BR>
then there was to clue that I had Crohn's.  Like you, I had an over-abundance<BR>
of energy.  I was on that strict diet for almost a year ( I am certain I had<BR>
Crohn's already because some not-so-apparent symptoms began to manifest<BR>
themselves).  Instead of getting better, I got progessively worse, obviously.<BR>
 I began to cheat about several months ago  (ie. sandwiches).  But I was<BR>
primarily still vegetarian.  In fact I was the bread queen.  Bloating and<BR>
cramping began to be a problem around June.  That's when I went on a 11 day<BR>
raw food fast (fruit, vegetables and fesh juices).  The bloating and cramping<BR>
went away completely.  I felt energetic and wonderful.  Then I went back to<BR>
starches.  So the bloating / craping returned with a vegence.  I did not eat<BR>
any kind of dairy, and ate organic foods.  I drank soy or rice milk with<BR>
organic health food cereal so as to not combine animal protein with starches,<BR>
and not to upset my system with lactose.  No use.  Not until did I eliminate<BR>
all starches on the SCD diet did my bloating and cramping go away.<BR>
So, I was my personal guinea pig for a long time trying everything, and it<BR>
still comes down to starches.<BR>
<BR>
Well, there you have it.  <BR>
<BR>
Simone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;...My question is, if so many nutritionists who study the effects of<BR>
food on the<BR>
digestive system individually state the same thing about food<BR>
combination,<BR>
then why hasn't Elaine mention it?  I know we don't have to be concerned<BR>
<BR>
about combining starch with protein, but I am a little bit concerned<BR>
about<BR>
fruit and other foods...&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I have wondered the same.  I've tried the fit-for-life diet before I'd<BR>
discovered the SCD, at a time when I was in a long remission from CD.  I<BR>
found that it increased my energy.  I believe that Elaine's diet is<BR>
based upon her research as a microbiologist, and her research on Dr.<BR>
Haas.  Her book is an effort to bring this breakthrough diet into the<BR>
mainstream.  Perhaps she hasn't wanted to dilute her findings with other<BR>
theories, although related to health, not specific to curing IBD'ers.  I<BR>
have no basis for suspecting that Elaine would agree with the &quot;fruit&quot;<BR>
combining aspects which aren't essential to the SCD.  If you are smart<BR>
(which you are or you wouldn't be here) you will do what works for you!<BR>
I &quot;forgot&quot; about the fruit business, ate ribs and apples last night, and<BR>
expect that my coworkers won't be happy campers today (fugure it out)!<BR>
So, I hope I can incorporate this &quot;habit&quot; to avoid fruit during or after<BR>
eating anything else on the SCD.  It's just a matter of timing, dosen't<BR>
mean I have to give up anyting else.<BR>
<BR>
I was wondering, though, if perhaps the SCD is really a food combining<BR>
thing.  Maybe we CAN eat starches, carbos, etc, but NOT with proteins.<BR>
Maybe it is the combining that is irritating our stomachs, or preventing<BR>
the proper breaking down, or absorption of the carbs.  Anyone willing to<BR>
be the guinnea pig and try eating starches by themselves and see it they<BR>
get sicker?  (I'm NOT!)  Just wondering....<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;01bcdbf8$4a9851c0$LocalHost@backpack&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi Folks,<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that many of you have experienced the same exasperation that I have<BR>
had in trying to find a health professional that has the correct recipe to<BR>
return you to health. Out of this exasperation we were all motivated to find<BR>
alternative ways to treat our diseases, some ways of which were at odds with<BR>
the medical establishment. This search led me to this Internet support<BR>
group. I've been on the diet for almost three months now and have seen the<BR>
improvements. Although I can't tolerate a lot of the foods on the SCD, the<BR>
foods that I can eat are well tolerated.<BR>
<BR>
But, one question that has nagged at me for the last few years is &quot;why am I<BR>
intolerant of all of these foods all of the sudden(in the last 6 years).&quot; I<BR>
often try to look towards a spiritual connection for such answers. I believe<BR>
we evolve spiritually through many incarnated lives. I also believe that we<BR>
are all on a path to achieve balance in spirit through the incarnated lives<BR>
that we have. So because of this belief I find that I ask myself, &quot;what is<BR>
the spiritual lesson that I'm supposed to learn through this health<BR>
challenge.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I frequently seek council from a women in Fresno who is very spiritually and<BR>
psychically connected. I've received answers to many of the perplexing<BR>
issues in my life through her sessions with me. She has been doing this for<BR>
people for 46 years. At first I was skeptical, so in my first session I<BR>
asked her to give me a reading (this was before I told her anything about<BR>
myself). Within ten minutes she told me everything about the major aspects<BR>
of my personality for the 42 years of my life. She also told me that I was<BR>
receiving a disability payment from the veteran's administration, that I had<BR>
one daughter who was married and carrying a child, and many other things.<BR>
Needless to say, I was convinced of her authenticity. She also told me that<BR>
I was going to live a very long life. That's good to hear in light of the<BR>
cancer risk that I face with this digestive disorder.<BR>
<BR>
Since the initial consultation I've seen this counselor many times and have<BR>
asked her questions about this lousy health challenge of mine. I asked how<BR>
long I was going to have to put up with Chron's. She said that my spirit<BR>
guides said &quot;for as long as I need it (the disease).&quot; Spirit guides don't<BR>
make life easy on us. They only give us the information that we really need,<BR>
when we need it. Other than that we have to work to discover the answers for<BR>
ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
As the discussion over this problem continued, my counselor told me that my<BR>
catering personality has a lot to do with this disease. She said I have a<BR>
ministerial spirit and the many of my lives have been as a minister, monk,<BR>
holy man, care taker, counselor for troubled youths, and so forth. But the<BR>
balance I must achieve is to know when to &quot;let go and let God.&quot; Since it is<BR>
my nature to take care of others in need, I find it very difficult to let go<BR>
of people in need when they persist towards a path of self-distruction. For<BR>
most of this life, I've been surrounded very closely with people that need<BR>
to be able to fall on their faces to learn the lessons that they need to<BR>
learn in life. I end up being their temporary savior from learning what they<BR>
must learn through the school of hard knocks. My counselor says I just make<BR>
their lives easy for them because when I take care of them they don't have<BR>
to work on the major issues that they need to work on in their own lives.<BR>
She says that I'm actually doing them and myself a disservice. I have a bad<BR>
habit of taking care of these people when they aren't ready for it. I only<BR>
torment myself because I end up enduring abuse from the very people that I'm<BR>
trying to help. I go through a lot of internal aguish, yet there is always<BR>
this inability within me to say &quot;NO&quot; to someone that I really should let go<BR>
of. To make a long story short, the disease that I am living with today is a<BR>
manifestation of my inability to &quot;let go and let God.&quot; My counselor told me<BR>
that I've been working on this for many lives, but I still haven't gotten<BR>
it.<BR>
<BR>
She said that I confuse love with having to take care of others. The cost of<BR>
this is that I don't take care of my own needs which prevents me from living<BR>
in harmony with myself. As a result my physical system is out of balance.<BR>
Until I learn to &quot;let go&quot; when needed, yet still &quot;LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY,&quot; I<BR>
will continue to suffer.<BR>
<BR>
My counselor also said that if we have lived many lives in a specific<BR>
geographic location that we can develop intolerances to foods that are<BR>
prevalent to that area. This is supposed to happen to allow us to achieve<BR>
balance by living in geographic areas other than the areas that we are most<BR>
comfortable with.<BR>
<BR>
Just food for thought (no pun intended),<BR>
<BR>

&gt;As someone who suffers from some symptoms of hypoglycemia, I can say that<BR>
&gt;junk food will give you a temporary &quot;sugar high&quot;, especially when you haven't<BR>
&gt;had it in a while.  You will feel temporarily great, like an addict getting<BR>
&gt;drugs.  It can be very powerful and just as dangerous. The pancreas will put<BR>
&gt;out extra insulin and then a downward spiral can begin ( that feeling 2 days<BR>
&gt;later).  <BR>
<BR>
Yes, I started to understand that &quot;suger high&quot; insulin-glucagon &quot;cat<BR>
chasing its tail&quot; cycle when I read Sears' &quot;The Zone&quot; book.<BR>
<BR>
Strangely enough, I felt these cravings much more BEFORE my bowel surgery;<BR>
now, 7 weeks post-op, I seem to have practically lost this vicious<BR>
&quot;drug-addict-crazed&quot; craving for sweets, only eating some occasional mostly<BR>
&quot;out of habit&quot; but I can't say I'm really enjoying it ... only ice cream<BR>
seems to taste OK, the rest simply seems too sweet or ugly-tasting, whereas<BR>
&quot;good&quot; food tastes much nicer to me.  Maybe it's because now I &quot;can&quot; eat<BR>
all that junk, or maybe something about my metabolism has changed ... I dunno!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Treatment - high protein diet.  I'm no biochemist, obviously, but<BR>
&gt;that's my 2 cents!  <BR>
<BR>
Actually, I find I get a &quot;sweets&quot; croving MOST after a high-meat meal (e.g.<BR>
2 bbq'd hamburgers, or a nice steak); personally, I'm leaning more toward<BR>
increasing my fat &amp; veggies intake, which don't seem to make me<BR>
&quot;sweets-hungry&quot; after eating, than high-protein, of which I get ample already.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Jane<BR>
&gt;P.S. If a person is healthy, than once in a while that's okay, but I find I<BR>
&gt;just crave more.  I'm sure that's what got me into this trouble.  Also<BR>
&gt;happens with eating carbos because they are readily turned into sugar. Have<BR>
&gt;you heard the term carbohydrate sensitivity? I think we all know that once<BR>
&gt;you go off this kind of food for a while you crave it less and less.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ah, maybe THAT's what's happened to me?  I spent 2 months in hospital (I'm<BR>
in Canada, so I didn't go broke on that little adventure), and during that<BR>
time didn't eat much carbo-wise.<BR>
<BR>
But, no, I had not heard that specific term &quot;Carbohydrate sensitivity&quot;<BR>
though isn't that the gist of Sears' &amp; Elaine Gottschall's &amp; &quot;The Yeast<BR>
Connections&quot; thinking/methods?<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It is<BR>
&gt;amazing how people react when you tell them you don't eat sugar or bread,<BR>
&gt;they say &quot;I couldn't live without my bread, pasta, chocolate, etc.  I even<BR>
&gt;have a friend with severe UC that still won't read the book because she fears<BR>
&gt;life without pasta!  Food is a powerful drug!  <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Well, I have to admit, it IS difficutl to wind your way through meals<BR>
without refined carbo's, esp. grain products.  Now that I &quot;can&quot; eat them<BR>
again, I must honestly say I DO enjoy my food much more, but I won't<BR>
belabour you with details about crisp rye bread, etc.  I'm not sure which<BR>
is the more &quot;natural&quot; (i.e. in tune with the body's true Nature) way to<BR>
eat: avoid all grains &amp; starches as Elaine says, or DO eat them if one's<BR>
body tolerates them.  <BR>
<BR>
It seems to me the Roman soldiers were issued rations of hearty grain<BR>
breads, and they were hardy as hell, conquering whole continents.  I don't<BR>
know what the ultimate answer is, maybe folks (like you &amp; I) with IBD are<BR>
simply genetic abberations, so we just have to wind our way through the<BR>
maze of our IBD, using the tools at our disposal, whereas in olden days we<BR>
would simply have been eliminated through processes of evolution by dying<BR>
out?  Who knows ...<BR>

Ellen, <BR>
I'm going out to eat tonight and just read your message!  It's an Italian<BR>
restaurant, but I know they always have a fresh fish and I'll order it<BR>
P-L-A-I-N and oil and vingar for the salad - mix it all together and I'll<BR>
have a fish salad!  I know what you mean about not having a food and becoming<BR>
over-sensitive when you try it again. A couple of years ago I went off all<BR>
dairy even though I was eating it alright.  I had dark circles under my eyes<BR>
and had become a vegetarian, so why not go vegan.  Well, during the summer I<BR>
tried several times to have a frozen yogurt - severe D.  Was always able to<BR>
eat it before.  In one health book, I read about a Dr. who would put allergy<BR>
patients in the hospital for a week, NPO (kind of like us not eating<BR>
something for a while).  Then introduce one food group at a time to see if<BR>
there was a reaction.  Obviously, if there was, that food was to be avoided<BR>
(I feel he was only treating the symptoms though and not the root of the<BR>
problem). So I guess you have some allergy to the foods your were<BR>
reintroducing.  When you eat a little of all kinds of food, even ones you<BR>
might be allergic to, your system builds up a tolerance for it.  When you go<BR>
off of the allergic substance you no longer retain that tolerance.  I also<BR>
