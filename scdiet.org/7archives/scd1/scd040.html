Probiotics are the essential friendly bacteria needed in the intestinal tract
to digest food.  These are often lacking or out of balance with intestinal
disorders.  They include Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus
and Bifidobacteria bifidum.  The Natren products come in powder form which you
mix in water, 1/2 teaspoon each.  There are two varieties, in dairy based
(which Elaine recommends) and the other on a soy or bean based which those on
SCD shouldn't take.<BR>
The home made yogurt will provide some of the above; but I don't tolerate the
yogurt and need them so these Probiotics have been a tremendous help for me.

What should I know about taking Probiotics that I might not think to ask<BR>

Is there additional supplements i should also be taking with<BR>
pro-biotics?<BR>

One important friendly bacteria,(Acidophilus) was completely missing from<BR>
my intestinal tract as indicated in The Great Smokies Lab test results. You<BR>
will not get this information from conventional medicine unless your doctor <BR>
uses their services.<BR>
Acidophilus stands for &quot;acid loving&quot;. These vital microorganisms thrive in<BR>
an acid environment.  A pH of 7.7 (alkaline) will not support this microflora.<BR>
I have been told that it is not uncommon to see test results showing an<BR>
alkaline gut in which pathogenic bactera thrive. Acidifying the gut with<BR>
various<BR>
natural agents like fresh lemon juice, etc. is helpful in restoring that<BR>
environment.<BR>
I am happy to hear that others like myself have been helped by the product<BR>
Nature's Biotics. Jill has a reply mentioning this product. My story, if you<BR>
haven't read it,<BR>
can be found on the web at this address:<BR>

&gt; Thanks for your response, Ruth. I would also love to know...have you tried<BR>
&gt; probiotics, Ruth? Have you had any success with those? I know of two people<BR>
&gt; who SWEAR by it for both UC and Crohn's. Unfortunately, much as I respect<BR>
&gt; and admire these folks and their wonderful recovery, they also happen to<BR>
&gt; SELL the stuff. And the cost is somewhat prohibitive, so I would appreciate<BR>
&gt; hearing from others on this list regarding their first-hand experiences,<BR>
&gt; positive or negative, with the Homeostatic Soil Organisms.<BR>

I just started taking Probiotics from Natren a couple of weeks ago. I don't the<BR>
foggiest clue if I can pinpoint anything to this product. I had been getting<BR>
better because I'm  fanatical about what food goes in my gut. I'm still eating<BR>
mostly the cooked/ baked foods. Only one piece of  fruit a day and a small<BR>
amount of raw veggie.<BR>
<BR>
I have been adhering to scd without any margin for error in the type of food I<BR>
select and the way it's prepared. I have also been using the Rowasa<BR>
Suppositories which has also  helped me cause my colitis flare is very low<BR>
down.<BR>
<BR>
If I couldn't afford to buy probiotics I would probably being doing the same<BR>
without them.<BR>
I do love my B complex and B12 vitamins. I feel differently (tired) when I<BR>
don't take them.<BR>
<BR>
I have no idea what the  Homeostatic Soil Organisms is about.<BR>
