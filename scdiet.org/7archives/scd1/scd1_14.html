Dear Prateeksha,<BR>
Another way to cool down the milk or 1/2 &amp;1/2 is to set the hot pan in a <BR>
metal bowl of cold water. About 5 min. later, toss that water out, and<BR>
start again with more cold water. I haven't timed it, but it seems like it<BR>
takes about 15 minutes. <BR>
I've also found that the milk heats up faster if you keep a lid on the pan<BR>
between stirrings.<BR>

I am in heaven.  I just made some &quot;cookies&quot; from the Honey Almond Crisp<BR>
recipe by dropping teaspoonfuls of the mixture into the bottom of<BR>
non-stick muffin tins.  They only take about ten to twelve minutes to<BR>
bake.  Also, in case anyone wants to try this, I can't eat dairy so I<BR>
substituted olive oil for the butter and they are a little chewier<BR>
rather than crispier, but really delicious.  I also have made the recipe<BR>
with pecans and it came out fantastic. One addition that's different<BR>
from the recipe in the book, I added a pinch of salt.  Yum.<BR>

Hi Everyone.<BR>
<BR>
Questions:<BR>
<BR>
Other than saying in the book, &quot;no seaweed&quot;, Elaine does not explain. <BR>
I<BR>
don't know much about seaweed, but hear that spirulina and perhaps blue<BR>
green algae are very good for intestinal disorders.  Does anyone know what<BR>
the properties of seawood are?  Carb or starch?  or what?  If not carb or<BR>
starch; then why is it a no-no?<BR>
<BR>
Also, what bout wheat grass?<BR>
<BR>
Anyone know about ginseng?  Isn't it supposed to be strengthening?  I get<BR>
so weak on this diet that I am looking for ways to supplement it that are<BR>
complimentary and will improve my strength and decrease weakness.<BR>
<BR>
Food combining - this week, as an experiment, I have stopped eating fruit<BR>
and find my gas problem has subsided considerably; as well as the cramping.<BR>
I know that fruit is a source of carbs for me so even more reason for the<BR>
interest in ginseng, wheat grass, spirulina, etc.<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
Vanilla Bean Extract - I use quite a bit of this, as the recipes call for<BR>
it and to my horror, yesterday I noticed on the bottle of &quot;Crown<BR>
Colony&quot;<BR>
brand that it contains sugar!  So, we have to be very careful of the brand<BR>
that we buy...found &quot;Frontier&quot; in a health food grocery store that does<BR>
not<BR>
contain sugar.<BR>
<BR>
Hughson Nut Co. - yesterday called to place an almond flour order; talked<BR>
to &quot;Janet&quot;.  They have a new p.o. box no.1150.  Fax 209 - 883-2973. <BR>
Not<BR>
listed in the book.  They accept check or money order only; however, soon<BR>
will have credit card option and we can order by credit card on the<BR>
internet soon!<BR>
<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
I am feeling so much better psychologically since joing the SCD-list group;<BR>
don't feel so alone with this diet; and am enjoying the support enormously.<BR>
My spirits have really gone up since joining.  Thanks everyone for<BR>
sharing.<BR>

Hi, <BR>
<BR>
&gt; Anyone know about ginseng?  <BR>
<BR>
I have used Siberian Ginseng.  It didn't trigger any bad effects for me.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Food combining - this week, as an experiment, I have stopped eating &gt;<BR>
fruit and find my gas problem has subsided considerably; <BR>
<BR>
I found that I had to give up fruit completely in the beginning of the<BR>
diet.  Now (after six months) I can eat apples and cantelope, I still<BR>
can't eat peaches.  It's hard to get the courage to add one in to see if<BR>
it bothers me or not.<BR>

Dear Raman, <BR>
My book has no mention of &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot; you refer to below.<BR>
Here is what I found in the book:<BR>
<BR>
Do not use any product that contains FOS (fructooligosaccharides). This<BR>
form of starch (inulin) may feed harmful bacteria as well as &quot;friendly&quot;<BR>
bacteria and will defeat the benefits of the diet. <BR>
If you are using preparations containing &quot;friendly&quot; bacteria (which<BR>
often<BR>
contain other ingredients), it is better to use products that contain<BR>
lactose (or whey) than FOS.<BR>
<BR>
Let me know if your book actually says something different. <BR>

&gt; The acidophillus doesn't have to be lactose based.  The book advised<BR>
&gt; against  taking supplements containing FOS (fructo-oligo saccharides<BR>
&gt; sp?).  It went on to say that given the choice between supplements<BR>
&gt; (such as acidophillus) that contain FOS or supplements that contain<BR>
&gt; lactose, choose the lactose (&quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;). <BR>
&gt;  However, it be would be ideal to use a non-lactose, non-FOS brand<BR>
&gt; of acidophillus.<BR>

&gt; I believe that urgency is a result of the area affected-that area near<BR>
&gt; the rectum.  The muscles there are supposed to react to stool presence.<BR>
&gt; Since there is undoubtedly swelling there, the sence of urgency<BR>
&gt; prevails.  My experience has been that the disease &quot;gravitates&quot; to<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; descending colon as I get better, and eventually dissipates.  It means<BR>
&gt; she is on the road to recovery.  Stick it out, if at home, so be it.<BR>

&gt; &gt; Perhaps there are some who can relate to the following problem and<BR>
&gt; &gt; offer us<BR>
&gt; &gt; some insight and hopefully the benefit of similar situations.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Our daughter (20) has been faithful (and fanatically devoted) to the<BR>
&gt; &gt; diet<BR>
&gt; &gt; for 19 months (12 months with meds, Salofalk and Prednisone -20mg).<BR>
&gt; &gt; She is<BR>
&gt; &gt; diagnosed as having Crohns Colitis - Crohns of the colon.  In that<BR>
&gt; &gt; time her<BR>
&gt; &gt; weight has continued to increase, she exercises and her bloodwork is<BR>
&gt; &gt; returning to normal.  She does not eat any raw fruit and can tolerate<BR>
&gt; &gt; some<BR>
&gt; &gt; cooked fruits.  She eats much of the rest of the diet including<BR>
&gt; &gt; nutbreads,<BR>
&gt; &gt; pizza, meats and cheese/yougurt.  In the spring and early summer she<BR>
&gt; &gt; had a<BR>
&gt; &gt; colonoscopy and she has no disease in her small intestine, her ileum<BR>
&gt; &gt; is free<BR>
&gt; &gt; of disease and there is superficial disease in the ascending,<BR>
&gt; &gt; transverse and<BR>
&gt; &gt; decending colon.  There is some disease activity in the last 6 inches<BR>
&gt; &gt; involving the sigmoid and the rectum.  The problem she faces is one of<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; urgency.  This has continued to plague her despite the lack of other<BR>
&gt; &gt; symtoms<BR>
&gt; &gt; that bothered her in the past.  As such, she is very uneasy about<BR>
&gt; &gt; getting<BR>
&gt; &gt; out, going places and becomes anxious on the days when thing loosen<BR>
&gt; &gt; up.  She<BR>
&gt; &gt; has not had any formed BM, some days are better than others and there<BR>
&gt; &gt; is<BR>
&gt; &gt; occasional thickening of the stools - but there are still loose.  We<BR>
&gt; &gt; recieved a good suggestion to keep a diary and note things.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Has anybody gone through the same?  Did you notice any particular<BR>
&gt; &gt; trend or<BR>
&gt; &gt; pattern? Did anything make the urgency better or worse?  How long did<BR>
&gt; &gt; it<BR>
&gt; &gt; last? and  what other things did you notice.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; This is an extremely trialsome time - the urgency is making her a<BR>
&gt; &gt; prisoner<BR>
&gt; &gt; in her own home.  Help would be appreciated.<BR>

I don't think algea and seaweed are related.  Algea forms on fresh water<BR>
ponds (and fresh water acquariums like mine!)  Seaweed grows in the ocean and<BR>
is a plant.  They seem very different to me, but perhaps someone can address<BR>
this with greater specificity.<BR>
<BR>
I took algea for a time before I got crohns and was pleased with the results,<BR>
but since then have heard differing views on it that made me think it might<BR>
be dangerous.  I no longer take it.  Evidently the harvesting and processing<BR>
of the algea is very significant to the safety of the final product and,<BR>
since it is an unregulated product, there are no assurances on that process.<BR>
 Sorry I can't be more specific.  It's been a couple of years since I read up<BR>
on it.<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt; I have stopped eating fruit<BR>
 and find my gas problem has subsided considerably; as well as the cramping.<BR>
 I know that fruit is a source of carbs for me so even more reason for the<BR>
 interest in ginseng, wheat grass, spirulina, etc.<BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Were you eating fresh fruit or cooked fruit?  You may find that cooked fruit<BR>
bothers you a lot less than fresh.  Juice may alos be an option.  It may be<BR>
worth a try since, you are right, you need the carbs so you don't lose any<BR>
more weight.<BR>
<BR>
I'm no expert but I looked up a few things.  The US RDA for carbohydrates is<BR>
about 200-300 mg a day depending on age, sex, level of activity, etc.  I<BR>
analyzed a sample SCD menu against the RDA levels for calories, fat, protein,<BR>
and carbohydrates.  It came out as 120% of the calories, 180% of the fat,<BR>
180% of the protein, and only 80% of the carbohydrates recommended.  It may<BR>
be challenging to keep your carbs up on this diet (especially if you have<BR>
long term trouble with fruit).  If you get only 60 carbs a day or less you<BR>
could induce ketosis which means your body will burn body fat for it fuel<BR>
needs.  There is debate as to whether that's healthy or not, but given that<BR>
you are underweight, I'd wager you'd rather not be there!<BR>
<BR>
Here's a rough idea of the carb values of SCD food.  This might help you<BR>
determine whether you are getting enough carbs in a day and, if not, which<BR>
foods you might be able to emphasize:<BR>
<BR>
Fish, check, bacon, pork, lamb, veal, beef, eggs have 0 g. of carbohydrates<BR>
Olive oil and butter have 0 g.<BR>
1 C cottage cheese has 3 g.<BR>
1 C plain yogurt has 15 g.<BR>
2 T. peanut butter has 8 g.<BR>
1 T. honey has 17 g.<BR>
1 med banana has 27g.<BR>
1 apple has 19 grams<BR>
1 C apple juice has 28 g.<BR>
1 C applesauce has 50 g<BR>
1 C beans has 30 g. (navy, lima)<BR>
1 C spaghetti squash has 9 g.<BR>
1 C broccoli/cauliflower has about 6 g.<BR>
1 C coconut has 12 g.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, you can see how in being &quot;specific&quot; about our carbohydrates, it<BR>
would<BR>
be easy to end up low in carbohydrate.  For people with moderate or excess<BR>
weight it's not a problem, but for those who are already underweight, and<BR>
find themselves losing even more weight, it might be worth consideration.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this is helpful,<BR>

Hello all<BR>
<BR>
My husband has been on the scd for one month now and is doing good.  He was<BR>
able to get off of Prednisone and is now lowering his dose of Asacol.<BR>
However, he's been plagued with being very hot at night. Even before he was<BR>
on the SCD he always gets hot at night but it's not really a fever.  Has<BR>
anyone ever experienced this and did it ever go away?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To Prateeksha <BR>
<BR>
my husband has enormously reaped the benefits of barley grass. Not only does<BR>
it have a lot of vitamins and minerals but it helps to give him energy.  We<BR>
buy  a product called &quot;Just Barley&quot; It has no other additives and comes<BR>
in a<BR>
powdered form. <BR>
I first bought Dr. Hagiwara's Green Magma but found out that it had brown<BR>
rice added.<BR>
So I drink that one and have found it helps my PMS.<BR>

Hi everyone...<BR>
<BR>
more on ENERGY inducers:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Prescription for Nutritional Healing&quot; by James F. Balch, M.D., and<BR>
Phyllis<BR>
A. Balch, C.N.C., gives these (see subject) as often dramatically<BR>
increasing energy; however, in reading descriptions of these, I have<BR>
questions re the following:<BR>
<BR>
Siberian Ginseng - &quot;Ginseng contains thirteen different ginsenosides<BR>
(triterpenoid saponins).  The most important constituents include:<BR>
panacaene, B-elemene and panaxinol, LOW-MOLECULAR WEIGHT STARCHES pectin,<BR>
vitamins B1,2,3,5,12, and Bioltin; choline, minerals, SIMPLE SUGARS, traces<BR>
of germanium, and flavonoids.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
WHAT ARE &quot;LOW-MOLECULAR WEIGHT STARCHES?&quot; AND &quot;SIMPLE<BR>
SUGARS?&quot;  Can we have<BR>
these on the SCD?<BR>
<BR>
Bee Pollen - Also contains &quot;Simple Sugars&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Royal Jelly - &quot;From Montana Pollen&quot;???<BR>
<BR>
Aloe Vera Juice - Any forbidden ingredients in this?  Anyone had any<BR>
experience with it?<BR>
<BR>
Herbs given to increase energy in this book:<BR>
<BR>
Acacia, cayene, ginkgo biloba extract, gotu kola, guarana.  Anyone have any<BR>
expereience with these?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Prateeksha.<BR>

&gt;my husband has enormously reaped the benefits of barley grass. Not only does<BR>

<BR>
At the risk of sounding even more stupid than I already have, with all my<BR>
questions, here's another one on Barley Grass.  Is it derived from Barley?<BR>
If so, this is a grain and forbidden.  So, what is barley grass?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Prateeksha.<BR>

Hi there,<BR>
How long was he on Pred, and did the hotness at night start before or after he<BR>
went on pred?  I used to get night sweats and hot flashes from Prednisone.  It<BR>
continued for a few months after going off the Pred and finally it went away<BR>
and I got back to normal.  Now I don't get hot at night, sweat profusely in my<BR>
sleep, or get hot flashes.  I believe in my case it was all caused by the<BR>
hormone imbalance that the Prednisone induces.<BR>

I concur on this.  My doctor always asks about these &quot;night sweats&quot; as<BR>
he calls them.  If it was me, I'd call my doctor.  I would guess that<BR>
you might need to go on a slower taper, so the doctor might say to go on<BR>
10mg for a few weeks or something to that effect.<BR>
<BR>
Tapering off pred to fast can lead to adrenal failure among other<BR>
things.  A naturalpath may have some suggestions on suppliments that can<BR>
boost adrenal function -- that may be worth a shot if you believe in<BR>
that kind of thing.<BR>
<BR>
Congrats on your success so far!<BR>

I have been underweight all my life. Before starting the SCD I was eating a<BR>
&quot;healthy&quot;<BR>
whole grain, legumes rich diet. Even though I ate like a horse, I was losing<BR>
weight.<BR>
Since starting the diet, I've gained over 30 much needed pounds and am now<BR>
holding at a<BR>
reasonable weight. <BR>
<BR>
It is now obvious that just because I was eating all of that food, it wasn't<BR>
being used<BR>
by my system. A modest quantity of carbohydrates that my body can use are a lot<BR>
better<BR>
than vast amounts that are just going through.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, my Crohn's hasn't improved much so I am contemplating surgery.<BR>

I've been on the diet over 18 months. Before I heard about the diet, I had<BR>
already <BR>
discovered that eliminating sugar and sweets from my diet pretty much controlled<BR>
the diarrhea. But my main problem now is pain and a tendency towards obstructions<BR>
in the area of my terminal Ileum which is very narrow for 6 to 12 inches of<BR>
length. I've<BR>
had 3 stays in the hospital for obstructions in the last 3 years, 2 of them since<BR>
I started the<BR>
diet. <BR>
<BR>
Elaine was surprised by my story and said that usually the pain was the first<BR>
thing to<BR>
get better on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, my last (and only) resection was 30 years ago this month. If I can get<BR>
another 30<BR>
years from a surgery, I'd be happy. With what I know now, I'd like to think I<BR>
could stay<BR>
healthy indefinitely. It's not like I am desparately ill or anything, more like<BR>
I'm just sick<BR>
of being sick. Never really well enough to get on with life, but not so sick that<BR>
I'm spending<BR>
all my life in bed or a hospital. I definitely feel better prepared for surgery<BR>
at my current <BR>
weight of 160 rather than under 130. At 6' 1&quot;, I'm still on the slender side<BR>
but at least have<BR>
some reserves.<BR>

Dear Tom,<BR>
Thanks for letting us know you situation. I guess it would make sense that<BR>
certain symptoms would be much easier to ease than others. Narrowing caused<BR>
by scar tissue (I'm assuming) would seem impossible to get rid of without<BR>
surgery, but as you say, once thats gone, with what you know, keeping whats<BR>
left should be much easier. Please keep us posted.<BR>
Wishing you the best,<BR>

I've gotten the flashes/sweats in the past as well. Been on and off preds<BR>
too although not in over 2 years. My own theory is that a damaged digestive<BR>
system works very very hard to accomplish what a healthy one does<BR>
automatically. I found that after eating too much at one sitting, I'd sweat<BR>
profusely. It was as though my entire body was just working overtime to<BR>

<BR>
Hi, thanks for your response.  I have been eating in the recent past, just<BR>
cooked fruit, but that didn't work either...also I find my stool is much<BR>
softer and loose when I eat even the cooked fruit...so I have stopped all<BR>
fruit...for now and it seems to help a lot.  Wonder if others have found<BR>
the same symptoms as I have with fruit, even cooked, give me gas, cramping,<BR>
and very loose stools?<BR>
<BR>
Also, juice does the same thing!  Even veg. juice...think it might be the<BR>
high concentration.  When I water down the bottled Welch's grape juice, it<BR>
seems to be okay.<BR>
<BR>
Your comment &quot;if you get only 60 carbs a day or less you could induce<BR>
ketosis which means your body will burn body fat for its fuel needs&quot; really<BR>
struck home with me...think that's why I have been losing weight since on<BR>
this diet and this probably contributes a lot to my extreme fatigue, as<BR>
well...not getting enough carbs...so since getting your email, I have<BR>
consciously tried to eat more of the higer carb foods on the diet and I<BR>
must say, my energy is somewhat better and I have very recently gained l/2<BR>
lb.!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
This has been very helpful, Ellen.  Thanks again.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;I heard the supplement DHEA helps the adrenal gland to function so I'm going<BR>
&gt;to look into that.<BR>
<BR>
I used DHEA to help me get off Pred too.  It was prescribed to me by a<BR>
Naturopathic Physician in Kent, Washington who was known to have a lot of<BR>
expertise in treating IBD successfully.  I think the key is to ensure you get a<BR>
pharmacy grade quality of the DHEA rather than the stuff off the health food<BR>
store or drugstore shelves.  The quality is completely different.  Another ND<BR>
told me how he prescribed it to someone and it helped them but then they<BR>
decided to get the cheaper off the shelf stuff and they got worse again.  I<BR>
can't say for sure whether it helped me or not because I was on the diet at the<BR>
same time and I believe it was either the diet or a combination of the diet and<BR>
DHEA that helped me get off Pred for good.  Before that, nothing I did would<BR>
allow me to get off it and my dose kept going higher and higher.  All I can say<BR>
is it's worth a try.  My advice is to first get the book by Ray Sahlian<BR>
(spelling may be wrong) called DHEA a practical user guide (or something to<BR>
that effect). Educate yourself on the subject.  I found it in my local library.<BR>
 It's a fairly new book and it is very well written, and easy to read.  The<BR>
author interviews many other doctors who have used DHEA in their practice.  It<BR>
explains what DHEA can and can't do, based on research studies, and scientific<BR>
facts.  I highly recommend it.<BR>

&gt;how soon (if ever) does the frequency of eilimination diminish (once one<BR>
&gt;starts the SCD diet.)<BR>
<BR>
Ted, it's different for everyone, but you should expect some improvement in the<BR>
first month of the diet.  Stay away from anything laxative until diarrhea<BR>
subsides.  This means avoid raw fruits and vegies, cooked fruits, nuts and<BR>
seeds.  When the diarreah calms down you can gradually introduce these things<BR>
one at a time, starting with stewed fruits.  If the diarrhea comes back, you<BR>
have to wait longer before trying them again.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;do bowel movements get normal at some future time after starting<BR>
&gt;the SCD diet ?<BR>
<BR>
I remember when I was so sick for so long, I could hardly remember what a<BR>
formed bowel movement was like.  I remember thinking to myself &quot;will I ever<BR>
have a normal bm again?&quot;.  It was hard to imagine that I would, after having<BR>
diarreah or loose stool continuously for over a year.  The fact is, the diet<BR>
slowly got rid of the diarreah and eventually I was down to one formed bm per<BR>
day, just as if I never had a disease at all.  I never thought I'd see that<BR>
day, but it came.  So keep the faith.  There is definately hope.<BR>

Hi Tom,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Since starting the diet, I've gained over 30 much needed pounds<BR>
&gt; and am now holding at a reasonable weight.<BR>
<BR>
I certainly hope to gain this much while on the SCD ;)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Unfortunately, my Crohn's hasn't improved much so I am<BR>
&gt; contemplating surgery.<BR>
<BR>
Surgery is definitely an individual decision to make.  Not one<BR>
to be taken litely.  If you have gained weight on the diet, what<BR>
is so bad now with CD that you think you need surgery to help<BR>
alleviate (not cure) your symptoms ?<BR>
<BR>
I have had two surgeries (Mar/86, Nov/95) and in both cases I felt<BR>
I had no other choice.  I had a perforated ulcer in '86, and<BR>
my wife was 5 months pregnant in '95.  In '95 I knew my wife<BR>
would need me in good health to help with the baby, so I could<BR>
not afford to wait a few more months.<BR>
<BR>
Beware what the doctors, or tests, say however before deciding<BR>
on surgery.  My upper barium test before my last operation only<BR>
showed one area of constriction.  What they found during the<BR>
operation were *four* sections that &quot;needed&quot; to be removed.  They<BR>
had to call in another surgeon to deal with the bowels being linked<BR>
together, which had to be separated.  So nothing is easy...<BR>
<BR>
I only found the SCD diet book one month before my last operation.<BR>
I tried it but found it was too late as things were too bad at<BR>
that time.  I was not on the internet to find any support groups.<BR>
<BR>
After the operation, diet was the last thing on my mind.  I had<BR>
even bought 25 lbs of almond flour, fully prepared to go back<BR>
on the diet after the operation.  It has been frozen the whole<BR>
time, and I am using it now.  I re-started the diet in June/97<BR>
after having lost 10 more pounds and my GI &quot;suggesting&quot; that I <BR>
should be put on nightly tube-feedings.  No thanks, I'd rather<BR>
have slow steady gain via the SCD diet.  I've had the maximum<BR>
lower bowel removed from my body already.<BR>
<BR>
This support group helps a lot.  If my story helps anyone,<BR>
this makes me feel like I have accomplished something positive<BR>
being forced to deal with CD.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for the length...<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi group,<BR>

Elaine comments that many people notice a relapse around 2-3<BR>
months into the diet, where I am now.  What does this involve ?<BR>
Does it mean D. for unknown reasons (regardless of not<BR>
introducing new foods), more gas, bloating ?<BR>
<BR>
I understand this is attributed to &quot;die-off&quot; of the bad yeast<BR>

You commented that your book does not add nut flour to the <BR>

&gt; &gt;Dear Tom,<BR>
&gt; &gt;I'm sorry to hear that your crohn's isn't much improved. I guess that if<BR>
&gt; &gt;there's anything positive to be gleaned from your letter, at least the<BR>
scd<BR>
&gt; &gt;has increased your weight, hopefully making you stronger, if indeed<BR>
surgery<BR>
&gt; &gt;becomes the only option. How long have you been on the diet and what has<BR>
&gt; &gt;your experience been with it?<BR>
&gt; &gt;Rachel<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I've been on the diet over 18 months. Before I heard about the diet, I<BR>
had already <BR>
&gt; discovered that eliminating sugar and sweets from my diet pretty much<BR>
controlled<BR>
&gt; the diarrhea. But my main problem now is pain and a tendency towards<BR>
obstructions<BR>
&gt; in the area of my terminal Ileum which is very narrow for 6 to 12 inches<BR>
of length. I've<BR>
&gt; had 3 stays in the hospital for obstructions in the last 3 years, 2 of<BR>
them since I started the<BR>
&gt; diet. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Elaine was surprised by my story and said that usually the pain was the<BR>
first thing to<BR>
&gt; get better on the diet.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Anyway, my last (and only) resection was 30 years ago this month. If I<BR>
can get another 30<BR>
&gt; years from a surgery, I'd be happy. With what I know now, I'd like to<BR>
think I could stay<BR>
&gt; healthy indefinitely. It's not like I am desparately ill or anything,<BR>
more like I'm just sick<BR>
&gt; of being sick. Never really well enough to get on with life, but not so<BR>
sick that I'm spending<BR>
&gt; all my life in bed or a hospital. I definitely feel better prepared for<BR>
surgery at my current <BR>
&gt; weight of 160 rather than under 130. At 6' 1&quot;, I'm still on the slender<BR>
side but at least have<BR>
&gt; some reserves.<BR>

I'm replying to your post soliciting people's experiences with various<BR>
alternative medicines.  I think it's great that you are reading up and<BR>
seeking information but I hope that you're planning to only try one at a<BR>
time.  The reason is because it'll be difficult to know what's helping or<BR>
hurting you if you try too many new things at once, and they could also<BR>
interact in some way.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm sure you've already thought of this but I figured I'm mention it anyway.<BR>

Has anyone tried it yet? Reading the instructions on the back of the jar,<BR>
they say do NOT boil the milk, bring to 180F and maintain that temperature<BR>

Dear Dan, <BR>
I wouldn't worry about a huge setback happening now that you are at the 2-3<BR>
month point. I believe I came down with a cold for a few days, after a<BR>
couple months. That is the only cold I've had since being on the diet<BR>
almost 4 years. Any setbacks I've had with bleeding, etc., have gone away<BR>
within a couple days without medication.  <BR>
Hopefully you'll be gaining weight and feeling well soon.<BR>

We bought some of the Natren brand starter &quot;old world formula&quot; this<BR>
summer<BR>
to take on vacation with us.  I guess I didn't really read the instructions<BR>
and after reading your note I checked and it does state don't boil.  This<BR>
is what I found works for me:<BR>
<BR>
Bring the milk or 1/2 &amp; 1/2 to boil<BR>
cool<BR>
mix 2 teaspoons of yogurt starter with 4 teaspoons of cool milk and stir<BR>
pour into the remaining milk<BR>
<BR>
Works great and I have not had any trouble.  Nice and thick if you use 1/2<BR>
&amp; 1/2.<BR>

&gt; Dear Yogurt Making People (the brigade),<BR>
&gt; I'm thinking of trying the Natren brand yogurt starter &quot;old world<BR>
formula.&quot;<BR>
&gt; Has anyone tried it yet? Reading the instructions on the back of the jar,<BR>
&gt; they say do NOT boil the milk, bring to 180F and maintain that<BR>
temperature<BR>
&gt; for 5 min. Does anyone know why they would say not to boil the milk? I<BR>
&gt; always heat it until it at least starts to boil, or overflows all over<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; place (the second I turn my back).<BR>
&gt; Thanks, <BR>
&gt; Lucy<BR>

For those of you that like honey-mustard salad dressing, I've found<BR>
that my wife and I really like about 2 tablespoons of mustard and <BR>
1 tablespoon of honey (more or less to taste) mixed with 1/2 cup of <BR>
yoghurt.<BR>

&gt;Also, what bout wheat grass?<BR>
<BR>
Wheat grass is very healing for the liver and for open wounds, sores, and<BR>
ulcerations among other things. Ann Wigmore has written a book by that<BR>
title and is available in most health food stores.<BR>
One drinks the juice of the grass which is a simple sugar. The grain or<BR>
seed of the wheat is to be avoided on the diet.<BR>
I feel it would be ideal for the SCD and one begins to take it in small<BR>
amounts ie 1 or 1/2 oz at a time.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Anyone know about ginseng?  Isn't it supposed to be strengthening?  I get<BR>
&gt;so weak on this diet that I am looking for ways to supplement it that are<BR>
&gt;complimentary and will improve my strength and decrease weakness.<BR>
<BR>
Ginseng is very strengthening and is for the mental center too. I would<BR>
suggest calling GAIA herbs in Boston and asking about their excellent<BR>
tinctures some of which are to energize the system. I read over their whole<BR>
catalogue yesterday because I am looking for clean products for intestinal<BR>
health. 1800-831-7780<BR>
Yerba Mate is a strengtener and does contain some caffeine.<BR>

<BR>
&gt;I don't think algea and seaweed are related.  Algea forms on fresh water<BR>
&gt;ponds (and fresh water acquariums like mine!)  Seaweed grows in the ocean and<BR>
&gt;is a plant.  They seem very different to me, but perhaps someone can address<BR>
&gt;this with greater specificity.<BR>
<BR>
I believe marine and fresh water algaes are related. The marine algae are<BR>
the seaweeds from the oceans or salt water. The fresh water algaes are from<BR>
lakes or hydroponics and are called spirulina, chlorela, blue-green. I<BR>
don't know their carb makeup ie simple vs complex sugars however I feel<BR>
they are very healthy for the intestinal walls. I have taken marine algae<BR>
for over 10 years.<BR>
The Wachter's Organic Sea Products Co. out of San Francisco, 65 years in<BR>
business, has the best quality marine algae and now I notice they are<BR>
putting rice bran, oat bran, FOS, and cereal solids in some of their<BR>
products. I don't buy those anymore.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Bee Pollen - Also contains &quot;Simple Sugars&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Bee pollen is considered a protein and good for immune disorders,<BR>
infections, energy, and a very efficient source of protein.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Royal Jelly - &quot;From Montana Pollen&quot;???<BR>
<BR>
Royal jelly is most likely similar to raw honey in compostion and gives<BR>
extraordinary energy. it is the food of the queen bee! Small amounts go a<BR>
long way and it is expensive.<BR>
<BR>
cayenne<BR>
<BR>
is considered good for healing wounds, sores, and ulcerations however if<BR>
one is internally inflammed and takes it they feel a burn. It's fighting<BR>
fire with fire. I think comfrey leaf tea or cold infusion of the root and<BR>
marshmallow are better for inflammation. Cayenne is a stimulant but you<BR>
have to deal with the 'fire.'<BR>
<BR>
ginkgo biloba extract<BR>
<BR>
Claims to get more oxygen to the brain and help memory. is usually blended<BR>
in formulas with astragulus, ginseng, gotu kola, etc to tonify the body and<BR>
give energy. See Gaia<BR>
<BR>
gotu kola<BR>
<BR>
It' a green  leaf and over time imparts great endurance.<BR>
<BR>
guarana<BR>
<BR>
I used g for a long time. It's a big stimulant, lots of caffeine, but it<BR>
got me up and running after a long bout with staph infection where I was so<BR>
weakened. However, it is from a pod and looks like a starch. I mixed it<BR>
with raw honey and ate a few tsp at a time.<BR>

<BR>
&gt;At the risk of sounding even more stupid than I already have, with all my<BR>
&gt;questions, here's another one on Barley Grass.  Is it derived from Barley?<BR>
&gt;If so, this is a grain and forbidden.  So, what is barley grass?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks, Prateeksha.<BR>
<BR>
Same as wheat grass. The grass is the simple sugar and the most healing<BR>
part of the plant. Barley grass is grown from the seed until the grass is<BR>
6-7&quot; high and then cut for juicing. No grain.<BR>
One source of barley grass is from the link below. Make sure it is free of<BR>
brown rice and is totally pure.<BR>

Hello!<BR>
<BR>
Well, my attempt to make yogurt with 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk was a =<BR>
success.  It came out very thick and absolutely delicious.  It is almost =<BR>
like putting whipped cream on my strawberries! =20<BR>
<BR>
Now if I could just find some UN-sweetened coconut I could make some =<BR>
cookies.  As for vanilla...I buy clear, imitation vanilla extract.  It =<BR>
does not list sugar as an ingredient, but it does say it contains &quot;other =<BR>
artificial flavorings&quot;.  I hope that is not a code word for something =<BR>
nasty.<BR>

<BR>
Hello everybody:  I've tried the diet for 2 1/2 months so far, although<BR>
it's not me but my adult son who is suffering from CD--if the dx is<BR>
correct.  He's in a good period and not wanting to try the diet (taking<BR>
low-dose Asacol).<BR>
<BR>
I've tried many recipes and think I'm getting the hang of it.  For me the<BR>
eating isn't bad--I'm breaking some food vices by throwing myself into<BR>
this; the food prep has been tricky but doable--I've been a little sloppy,<BR>
but not much, or otherwise it wouldn't be a fair test; the social dimension<BR>
has sometimes been trying.  e.g. I went to a &quot;fixed price&quot; restaurant<BR>
with<BR>
some people and asked to just try the pasta sauce (one of several courses)<BR>
without the pasta and was told off by the owner/chef; when one of my<BR>
friends tried to intercede it got worse.  Luckily I kept my cool, but it<BR>
gave me some first-hand experience with a situation someone in this group<BR>
had warned about.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not quitting yet, but have discovered I had to make some modifications<BR>
because the diet exacerbated a problem with constipation and hemorrhoids.<BR>
<BR>
I'm writing to tell you all thanks for letting me join you.  My whole sense<BR>
of how to be realistic and helpful to my son has hopefully improved since I<BR>
started conversations with people on the IBD list and scd list.  And you<BR>
guys have been significantly nicer to me, which counts for a lot!  My<BR>
experience is that it's a very big shock to the family when someone's dxed<BR>
with IBD, as well as to the sufferer.  From my own point of view only, I<BR>
will say that it changed me considerably.  I've discovered once again that<BR>
life is a marathon and not a sprint; qualities of kindness and courage from<BR>
others have been incredibly sustaining, and this group in particular makes<BR>
me grateful for the help.  You've been like those folks handing out little<BR>
cups of gatorade along the wayside of major races.<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to check in and tell you I appreciate you because Sept. 1 I'm<BR>
going into a disciplined work schedule (I work at home so this is all<BR>
self-generated and monitored) and may decide I have to withdraw for awhile<BR>
from subscribing to this list.<BR>
I unsubscribed to the Maelstrom address and got a message saying farewell,<BR>
sorry you're leaving.  I'd been gone for two weeks and when I came back I<BR>
just assumed the mailbox had changed, but when I got the message asking why<BR>
I was leaving I got confused.  What's the scoop?  Do we have a schism or<BR>
what?<BR>

A little history about my disease.  About 7 years ago I went to the Dr.<BR>
with a large perianal abcess(though I did not that was what it was then). <BR>
Following having it drained I was diagnosed with Crohn's in the large<BR>
intestine and rectal area.  I was told it was quite mild and was put on<BR>
Asacol.  I was symptom free for six years and the perianal fistula I had<BR>
from the abcess closed up.  But about 8 months ago I had a major rectal<BR>
bleed and was in the hopital for 10 days was put on a tapering dose of<BR>
prednisone, asacol, and flagyl(antibiotic).  After tapering off the pred I<BR>
have felt generally quite well (occasional diarhea and abdominal pain) the<BR>
doctor put me on Imuran in hopes of healing up the several perianal<BR>
fistulas I now have that continually drain pus and are quite messy.( I have<BR>
to put a dressing on them after every BM)   THE QUESTION I HAVE IS:  HAS<BR>
ANYONE OUT THERE WITH SIMILAR CROHN'S WITH PERIANAL INVOLVEMENT HAD ANY<BR>
LUCK USING THE SCD?<BR>
  Have a great day! :-)<BR>

Most of my Crohn's is perianal. It has been relatively mild, but was<BR>
getting worse. I was diagnosed last fall, and went on the SCD three<BR>
months later. My inflammed skin cleared up within a day or two. I sure<BR>
wish it had stayed cleared up. But the gas problem I was having did<BR>
go away. I have minor gas from time to time, but nothing like I was<BR>
having then. So the SCD definitely has helped. I'm trying to figure out<BR>
if tweaking the diet, such as abstaining from cheese, etc. would<BR>
help even more. So far I haven't been able to tell, but then I haven't<BR>
given up dairy for more than a few days at a time yet, either.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, whatever you decide to do.<BR>

Hi everybody,<BR>
<BR>
I found some acidophilus pills which have &quot;citrus pectin&quot; as an =<BR>
ingredient. I know in Elaine's book (on pg. 58) she says &quot;Do not use =<BR>
pectin in making jellies...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone know if this &quot;citrus pectin&quot; and the pectin Elaine refers =<BR>
to are the same thing?<BR>
<BR>
---------<BR>
<BR>
If you're interested, below is the acidophilus pill excerpt which =<BR>
explains a bit about why they use citrus pectin...(from this web =<BR>
site: http://www.solgar.com/home.html)<BR>
<BR>
Natural citrus pectin cellulose is added as a source of soluble =<BR>
dietary fiber to promote the<BR>
growth of these beneficial bacteria. Solgar's 40+ Acidophilus =<BR>
Vegicaps=AE supply a synergistic<BR>
blend of the four beneficial microorganisms L. acidophilus, L. =<BR>
bulgaricus B. bifidum and B.<BR>
longum, helping to restore and maintain a normal flora in the =<BR>
intestinal tract. L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus reside in the =<BR>

Does anyone know why pectin is not allowed on the scd although it is <BR>
found to exist naturally in fruits (citrus, apples, etc.)?<BR>

Pectin is a polysaccharide but I don't know whether or not it is <BR>

thanks for your response re wheat grass and ginseng and yerba mate.  You<BR>
mention that yerba mate does contain some caffein.  In the material I have<BR>

Well, here I am again!  So, here are some questions for those of you<BR>
who<BR>
have been on the diet awhile:<BR>
<BR>
Progesterone - mine has lactose in it; so talked to pharmacy and they<BR>
could<BR>
only substitute sucrose. My gyn has suggested I go off the natural<BR>
progesterone which is made of wild yam (carb or starch?) for 3 months<BR>
and<BR>
see what happens with the diet (been on 2 mos.).  Has anyone had any<BR>
experience with this?<BR>
<BR>
Side effects of either irritable bowel syndrome or ulcerative colitis<BR>
- two<BR>
doctors have given different diagnosis!  Vertigo; whelps - dime size,<BR>
intermittently appear on different parts of body...bright pink and<BR>
stay<BR>
anywhere from 1 week to 4 or 5.  Itch.  Not impetigo, (no cats).<BR>
<BR>
Raw food intolerance - after 2 mos. on the diet, still cannot<BR>
tolerate raw<BR>
fruits or veggies.  Wondering about veggie juice?  Like carrot, mixed<BR>
veggies.  Seems like that would be a great way to get my veggies, as<BR>
a<BR>
snack, etc. but would the raw juice have the same effect as raw<BR>
veggies?<BR>
Fruit?  I find my body is still too sensitive for oj, apple juice;<BR>
but<BR>
grape juice is okay and tomato juice (canned).<BR>
<BR>
Food intolerance - Finding I am still quite limited in vegetables I<BR>
can<BR>
tolerate.  I get diarrhea with eggplant; cramping with green beans,<BR>
peas,<BR>
asparagus.  Cannot combine protein with fruits; have to eat fruits<BR>
alone<BR>
and even then, get gas and sometimes cramping.  Does this change?<BR>
<BR>
There has been some improvement and I have been fanatical about<BR>
sticking to<BR>
the SCD diet; but I had hoped after I read the book, that things<BR>
would<BR>
improve a little faster than they have.<BR>
<BR>
Fatigue - Find I have to eat more often than 3x a day as I now have<BR>
no<BR>
energy reserves since being on the diet!  Anyone else have this?  I<BR>
used to<BR>
be able to go to the gym and have a mild workout, but since being on<BR>
the<BR>
diet, have not been once -- have to conserve my energy for work,<BR>
cooking<BR>
this diet, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Exercise - what do people are on the diet do?<BR>
<BR>
Weight Loss - I have lost about 10 pounds since being on the diet (2<BR>
mos)<BR>
and my doctor says &quot;no more weight loss!&quot; Down to 112 and 5'3&quot; and<BR>
this is<BR>
maybe a part of my fatigue.  Maybe my body is still adjusting to<BR>
change in<BR>
diet, no exercise, etc.  Has anyone else lost quite a bit of weight<BR>
with<BR>
this diet?<BR>
<BR>
I have had to start eating fish and chicken...my body is craving it,<BR>
after<BR>
25 years of being a vegetarian!<BR>
<BR>
Guess that's enough for now...HELP!!!!!!!<BR>

hi, <BR>
<BR>
i assume that when you follow the SCD diet one must taper off the <BR>
ASACOL, and that it is done without the help/advice of a doctor.<BR>
<BR>
my son is on 12 tablets asacol a day and once a day ROWASA enema, and<BR>
he is slowly improving. the doctor says later he must go on a maintenance<BR>
dose of asacol, forever, at the time i didn't know about this<BR>
diet so i didn't ask him about things like, how do you know if you take<BR>
too much asacol and what are the indications of such, i figured the doctor<BR>
would take care of him, and i was busy absorbing the bad news of him<BR>
having UC, it's only been since the 11th of august since we have known<BR>
about his disease but it seems like a lot longer. <BR>
<BR>
my question is, what have others done, to taper<BR>
off the asacol, and how do you know when to do so?<BR>
<BR>
i really appreciate the information that i have received from the people who <BR>
respond on this list, i want to thank all of you who have answered my questions.<BR>

As an acupuncturist working in public health, I treat people with night sweats<BR>
quite frequently.  I see a lot of people withdrawing from alcohol and other<BR>
drugs; night sweats is a common symptom of this.  Also people who are<BR>
HIV-positive often experience night sweats.  The phenomenon is not at all<BR>
limited to these groups, however.<BR>
<BR>
This kind of heat at night is a sign of what is called in Chinese medicine<BR>
&quot;yin<BR>
deficiency,&quot;  and is usually pretty easy to treat, either with acupuncture<BR>
alone, or in combination with Chinese herbs. (However, until I find out more<BR>
about the types of starch in various Chinese herbs, I'd probably tell SCDers to<BR>
stick to acupuncture).  I would &quot;guess-timate&quot; we get a success rate of<BR>
90%.<BR>
So, check out your local acupuncturist!<BR>

Dear Ted,<BR>
I can imagine that you are still reeling from the diagnosis of your son's<BR>
illness. I didn't do well with Rowasa, couldn't keep it in long enough for<BR>
it to do any good. It's a little early to talk about discontinuing meds but<BR>
this was what I did. After I'd been on the diet for 6 months for my UC, it<BR>
was obvious that all my symptoms had vanished. A year after I'd been<BR>
totally sympton free, I tapered off my meds (azulphadine) one at a time.<BR>
This was done without my doctor's knowledge. I figured if I got sick again<BR>
I'd just go back on. It is now a year since I've been off meds and I feel<BR>
great. I would never advise anyone to go off medication. This is a decision<BR>
one would have to make on their own. I've been lucky. In any case, I think<BR>
its way to early for you to be thinking about when you have to make this<BR>
step, but I hope the day will come for your son very soon when he can be<BR>
free of both the medication and the disease.<BR>

It seems to me about two weeks ago or so I read that Elaine does not<BR>

in the book as a source.<BR>
<BR>
Is this correct?  In going over my notes, I noticed this and I just ordered<BR>

&gt;ASACOL, and that it is done without the help/advice of a doctor.<BR>
<BR>
Ted,<BR>
I don't know what you are basing this assumption on since it does not state<BR>
this in the book.  Elaine says that the doctor will likely taper the meds as<BR>
symptoms disappear as a result of the diet.  She does not recommend going off<BR>
meds right away, or at all for that matter.  And she certainly doesn't tell us<BR>
to do it without advice or help from a doctor.<BR>
<BR>
I agree with Rachel in saying that it's way too early to think about tapering<BR>
or stopping the meds.  This should be done after all symptoms are gone.  In the<BR>
case of Prednisone, it is a super powerful steroid with numerous implications<BR>
and side effects on the body, therefore the incentive to get off of it is much<BR>
greater.  But even this must be done extremely gradually.  Sometimes even more<BR>
gradually than the doctor tells you.  The slower the better.  The sooner the<BR>
better also.  In the case of Asacol, it is totally different than Prednisone<BR>
and I would say a lot milder.  If the patient finds it is helping, they should<BR>
probably stay on it, even while on the diet, to be on the safe side.  There is<BR>
nothing that says you can't be on meds while on the diet.  You may be thinking<BR>
that &quot;how will you know if the diet is working if you are also on<BR>
meds?&quot;  Well,<BR>
it's true, you may not know for sure, but it's better to cover all bases.  The<BR>
patient may be less likely to have setbacks while on the diet if the Asacol is<BR>
continued in the mean time.  This has been my experience with Asacol.  I don't<BR>
know about the Rowasa because I haven't used it.  I have used Salofalk enemas<BR>
which are made of 5ASA (same as Asacol), and I found them useful as well. <BR>
Basically, my advice is not to worry about the 5ASA based meds, and to continue<BR>
them for a few months at least.  When the symptoms go away, you can tell the<BR>
doctor, and he likely will tell you to cut down on the meds.  He may not say to<BR>
go off them, ever, but this decision will be easier to make once the patient<BR>
has been symptom free for a long time.  I made the mistake of going off all<BR>
meds right away, and had a few setbacks.  I think it's better to stay on them<BR>
for a while, until your body is more healed and then attempt to go off them. <BR>
Prednisone is the exception to this rule.  In that case, I would try to get off<BR>
it as soon as possible, but also slowly.  The diet will likely help people get<BR>
off any type of meds because it allows the body to heal itself, making the<BR>
drugs less and less necessary.<BR>
<BR>
I know all too well that most doctors will not want to cooperate with the diet<BR>
because they won't believe in it. This may cause people to go on their own in<BR>
terms of medication decisions.  I have done this myself before.  I switched<BR>
from Asacol to Pentasa to Dipentum to Salofalk enemas, back and forth,<BR>
according to how I felt at the time, including stopping them altogether for a<BR>
while.  Sometimes you know your own body better than the doctor does, but when<BR>
you're dealing with a child, it's a different story.  You are better off<BR>
getting some guidance from the doctors, at least until you become more familiar<BR>
with the disease process and the effects of the different meds.<BR>
<BR>
In respect to your question about how do you know if you are taking too much<BR>
Asacol, I did this at one point.  I was taking way more than the doctor told<BR>
me, and I began getting severe itching all over the body.  This was a sign that<BR>
the dosage was too high because it was accumulating in the liver and causing an<BR>
allergic reaction of sorts.  I discontinued completely for a few weeks until<BR>
the itching stopped and then started up again at a lower dose.  This is not<BR>
likely to happen to most people because the doctors prescribe it based on body<BR>
mass I think.  It was my own fault that I got that reaction because I was<BR>
ignoring the doctor's dosage instructions.  This is very uncommon I think, as I<BR>
have never heard of anyone else having adverse reactions to Asacol.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this message is not too confusing.  Educate yourself on all the drugs<BR>
available for IBD so you know what to expect in terms of dangers, side effects,<BR>
and benefits.  Every time I got a prescription I would have the pharmacist give<BR>
me a photocopy of the page out of the Compendium of Pharmaceuticals that they<BR>
keep behind the counter for reference.  There is also a lot of info on the net<BR>
if you search.  If you are on the IBDdigest list also, you can search back<BR>
issues for topics of interest and see what people had to say about them over<BR>
the years.  I have found this to be a useful resource.  Check both <BR>
http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/default.html       and<BR>
http://128.248.251.136<BR>
<BR>
If your doctor is not cooperating with you, find a second opinion, and a third<BR>
and fourth if necessary.  My first doctor (gastroenterologist) was the type who<BR>
would dole out the Prednisone every time I had the slightest problem.  I didn't<BR>
know any better at the time, so I took it, and got &quot;hooked&quot; so to<BR>
speak,<BR>
because it was very hard to get off.  The only thing that allowed me to get off<BR>
the Pred was the SCD.  Finally I found another gastroenterologist who listened<BR>
to my desire to stay off Prednisone, and I haven't been put on it ever since. <BR>
I thank goodness that I got away from that first doctor.  Use your own<BR>
intuition when it comes to doctors and how you feel about them.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to you and your son.<BR>
