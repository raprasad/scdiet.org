<P>Hi,

<P>I saw on the web page something about muscle cramps and that maybe it was
due to potassium deficiencies because of the diet.  I sometimes get the
worst cramps in my toes and foot, where my toes curl up and get cramped and
it then involves my whole foot and them my leg.  It happens usually during
the night.  Could this be from nutritional deficiencies?  What vitamins and
minerals should we be sure to supplement?

<P>Thanks for your help.  Roz

<P>Ed and Roz White

<P>Roz-

<P>I have had trouble with this type of cramp as well.  I'm not sure I have
any great solutions, but they haven't been around lately so here are
some possibilities:

<P>I read that grapefruit juice is high in calcium.  It also has less sugar
than many juices, so I drink white grapefruit juice.  I was eating
grapefruits as well, but that seemed to disagree with me far more than
the juice itself.  (I sometimes find that sweet things with fiber are
far worse than the sweet by itself - with the fiber it doesn't get
absorbed early enough.)  Bananas are also good - I make banana muffins -
they are wonderful.  

<P>Since I have been consuming these two items the cramps have not been a
problem.

<P>Good luck, 
Nancy

<P>Roz:

<P>Low potassium and calcium are key elements missing when cramps are
common (so says my wife the athletic therapist). A recent study showed
Apple Cider Vinegar to provide very high levels of potassium, calcium
and other minerals.

<P>Mixed with an allowable sweetener like honey, two teaspoons with every
meal have been in the folk medicine ethos for centuries - for good
reason it seems. 

<P>With our malabsorbtion problems, it can possibly be of great benefit to
get the minerals in a non-food form which can be easier to digest and
absorb.

<P>weird - i have the same problems.  although, the foot cramping in the
middle-of-the-night seems to have disappeared (thankfully) as i progressed
on the diet (in my 7 month).  the occasional hip/side soreness (to the
touch) is also disconcerting.  sorry i don't have any solutions to offer.
if you find anything out - please share.  
<P>thanks, <BR>

<P>&gt;I'm having the same problem. I'm also feeling a lot of pain in my lower <BR>
&gt;back and sides... <BR>
&gt;I'm going to contact my Naturopath about this today - I'll post what I find <BR>
&gt;out. <BR>
&gt;Anyone else got suggestions? <BR>

<P>I just got a call from my Naturopath - he has something called Formula 303
that is just for this situation. <BR>
I haven't spoken to him directly yet (voicemail...), but I'll fill you all
in when I do!

<P>When I was on Azulphidine (SP?) I had terrible leg cramps at night. 
After I'd been on it awhile, the Dr prescribed folic acid to take with
it.   He said the Azul... depleted the folic acid from your body.  After
a few days of taking the folic acid, the cramps disappeared.   I  figured
it was a lack of folic causing the cramps, but I never asked about it.   <BR>
When I stopped the Azul..  a also stopped taking the folic acid
prescribed, although there is some in the Quin B strong vitamins that I
take daily.  The leg cramps have not returned. <BR>

<P>I as well have suffered many nights with leg and foot cramps.  This matter
was a subject discussed on earlier posts. The cramps reportedly are due in
part to a lack of calcium in our systems. <BR>
I have found great relief  from increasing liquid intake ( more water) and
using a bit more salt in the diet, while I was not adding any salt to my
diet. Also eating two or three Tums a day for the first few days then cut
back to one or two if you see any inprovements. Then just a occasional few
tums if I notice any signs or reacurring cramps.   Some light excercises are
also a benifit. This solved the leg cramp problem for me, hope it will for
you as well <BR>

<P>Although there are innumerable reasons for leg cramps, *most* people
suffer from one or more of 3 primary problems. Over the past few years I
have helped many patients get rid of their leg cramps - it just requires
a little trial and error.
<P>The big 3 are: calcium deficiency, potassium imbalance (usually
deficiency), and poor circulation. Calcium supplementation takes care of
the calcium-deficiency induced cramping. Potassium supplementation takes
care of my leg cramps - from electrolyte imbalances secondary to chronic
D. And for people with poor circulation, vitamin E and maybe Omega-3
fatty acids (EPA) help the cramps.
<P>A little trial and error, and I bet your cramps will vanish too. If you
have chronic D, you most likely will have an electrolyte problem:
calcium and/or potassium deficiencies.

<P>I agree with what's been said so far about this-calcium deficiency. I 
used to have restless legs at night when I was trying to go to sleep 
(this was before I started the SCD), occasionally cramps. My naturopath 
recommended a liquid mineral supplement and it really did the job. Now I 
only have other things to keep me awake at night-like my constant 
worrying! Oh well- that will take a little longer to remedy. <BR> Carole

<P>Hi Roz,
<P>&gt;  It was encouraging to hear how many people USED to have <BR>
&gt; this problem and have solved it.  That gives me hope that I can do it too. <BR>
<P>I also had this problem (including spasms in my hands along with unbearable
cramping) after taking so much prednisone.  This drug does, in addition to
creating deficiencies in other nutrients, mess up the sodium/potassium balance
in the body.  When I was in the hospital on IV prednisone, they couldn't get
the potassium (also on IV) into my body fast enough to compensate; it was just
impossible.  I still have to take potassium supplements, and if I don't take
enough Vitamin E also I get the same problem again.  So many of us on this list
have taken all sorts of harmful drugs for years, on top of having had serious
malabsorption for so long.  It is no wonder we have nutritional deficiencies!
<P>Continuing to supplement with vitamins and minerals, and following the diet
religiously, will gradually make everything better.
<P>Take care,
<P>Deborah
