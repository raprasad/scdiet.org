&gt;This may be tied to something called &quot;Leaky Gut Syndrome&quot;. I don't<BR>
&gt;know the science behind this theory, but it's something like since<BR>
&gt;our GI tract is not digesting foods properly and the tract is<BR>
&gt;ulcerated, some food molecules are passing through into the blood<BR>
&gt;and are then identified as &quot;invaders&quot; or &quot;foreign objects&quot; by our<BR>
&gt;immune system. We then develop anti-bodies to the food. This happens<BR>
&gt;mainly with foods we ingest on a daily basis.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;This might explain why people suddenly become intolerant to foods<BR>
&gt;they could previously tolerate fine. Many people recommend a 4-day<BR>
rotation<BR>
&gt;diet so that we don't eat the same food any more than every 4th<BR>
&gt;day so we don't develop allergies to them. I would guess that anyone<BR>
&gt;on SCD is eating nut flour products on a daily basis if they're<BR>
&gt;tolerated.<BR>

I to have experienced having minimal colds and flu over the years. I have had times <BR>
when all of my family would get something and it would miss me. <BR>
<BR>
The relationship of bowel disease is certainly up for speculation. For discussion <BR>
purposes I will give you my thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the major treatments for bowel disease involve supression of the immune system. <BR>
 These include immuran and 6MP. These treatments are not totally satisfactory. One man <BR>
in our support group found 6MP to be very effective for about 2 years after which it <BR>
became totally ineffective. Some people try it and it has no effect. The results I <BR>
have seen are mixed at best.<BR>
<BR>
Which do you suppose comes first, bowel disease and then a change in activity of the <BR>
immune system or a change in activity of the immune system which leads to bowel disease?<BR>
Remember, to have a cure, something is needed which addresses cause.<BR>
<BR>
I hypothesize that the bowel disease comes first. The immune system swings into action <BR>
to bring the body back to normal. This change in activity results in some of the <BR>
peculiar symptoms we get.<BR>
<BR>
If we speculate that the SCD is going after causitive factors then problems relating to <BR>
the immune system should clear up on their own.<BR>
<BR>
While I do not get colds/flu, I do have a long history of getting hay fever symptoms <BR>
from spring 'til frost. When I changed my foods, this started to clear up. I am to the <BR>
point now that I no longer ever take antihistamines. I believe that my own immune <BR>
system is now more able to deal with environmental factors than before as less of my <BR>
immune system is dealing with the bowel disease.<BR>
<BR>
The relationship of bowel disease and the immune system is demonstrated by the peak <BR>
outbreak of flares that occur in the spring and fall hay fever season. I'll never <BR>
forget the story (our local support group) when a woman told the group that her husband <BR>
had been hospitilized 4 consecutive years in the month of August. She thought that was <BR>
quite a coincidence. The probability of that happening by chance is 1 in 20,736. <BR>

Yes, it does seem like &quot;We IBD'ers have been given so much on our plates,<BR>
that I gues the big guys in the sky have decided 'enough already! We'll<BR>
spare (most of) them colds &amp; flu!&quot;. <BR>

&gt;I have 5 kids and volunteer at school and get FEWER colds and flu than most<BR>
&gt;people. I can take care of them when they have the flu and not get it,<BR>
&gt;though once in a &quot;blue moon&quot; I will. One particularly bad season when most<BR>
&gt;of the people in my house were sick and I wasn't, I thought of myself as<BR>

Sounds like the most constant thing you are eating is nut bread, so I would<BR>
be very suspect of that. Personally speaking, and I have candida, I don't<BR>
worry about the honey or fruit and eat much less nut bread (one a day). If I<BR>
were you I would go on a real &quot;easy to the system diet&quot; ie. Chicken soup,<BR>
gelatin etc. and start reintroducing slowing everything but the nut bread. I<BR>
know its hard, but I bet you probably will be able to have nut bread again,<BR>
just not 3 times a day. Did you see the mail that mentioned a similiar<BR>
problem and the rotation diet was a good approach to take where you have the<BR>
same food only once in 4 days. Don't give up, just redo your meal planning<BR>
and concentrate on protein, fats, soft fruits and veggies - give up the nuts<BR>
(for a while). Keep us posted. Take care, Jane <BR>

Can you take enzymes on this diet?<BR>

Also, the vitamins I give my son are from Whole Foods health food store,<BR>
they say no starch, hypoallergnenic, etc, are these ok? Or do you have to<BR>

Also, he seems constipated, has not had a bowel movement since starting the<BR>

Elaine said not to worry about the candida, it will go away with diet. Yet,<BR>

&gt;Even before I started the diet, having hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, I<BR>
&gt;would get<BR>
&gt;&quot;the shakes&quot; when my blood sugar fell too low between meals.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;When I first started the diet I would feel very faint (especially going up<BR>
&gt;a flight of stairs)<BR>
&gt;and a bit shaky, similar to low blood sugar shakes. I called my<BR>
&gt;nutritionist and he advised<BR>
&gt;me to eat more protein. He said I can have 5 servings a day of protein on<BR>
&gt;this diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;So if I get shaky and/or faint, I snack on something like peanut butter or<BR>
&gt;cheese.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I don't eat just 3 meals a day. After 8 hours of sleep at night, the blood<BR>
&gt;sugar gets real low so<BR>
&gt;I have a good breakfast with plenty of protein, a two-egg cheese omelet and<BR>
&gt;a zucchini muffin from<BR>
&gt;Elaine's book or toast made from almond nut flour with honey or apple<BR>
&gt;butter. Between breakfast and<BR>
&gt;lunch I snack on peanut butter and between lunch and dinner I usually try<BR>
&gt;to have a piece of fruit and<BR>
&gt;some cheese or something. It's the long stretch between dinner and<BR>
&gt;breakfast that I haven't worked<BR>
&gt;out a solution for so mornings are the hardest.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;This is my experience....hope it is useful to you somehow.<BR>

Hello Linda and all on the List:<BR>
<BR>
Hypoglycaemia, or as we now know it is a Low Blood Sugar condition<BR>
Linda you touched on a subject dear to my heart. I have lived most of my<BR>
long life with this condition. Only learned in the past fifteen years why I<BR>
had such wide mood swings, with some days barely being able to raise my<BR>
head long enough to growl at any and everyone. A total lack of energy with<BR>
complete exhaustion, yet the next day I might feel I could walk on water, h<BR>
aving bountless energy. Sugar can lift me to the highest degree of euphoria<BR>
imaginable, followed by a devastating low.<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the scd for near five years now and find I must be careful to<BR>
include some sugars ( not refined) in my day to day meals. To combat the<BR>
hypoglycaemia , a reasonable sugar level must be maintained. Somewhere<BR>
during the day I will eat the following foods for just that<BR>
reason.--------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
&gt;feel shaky. Is that normal?<BR>
Two or three cooking dates with some nuts for a quick pickup, and or a apple<BR>
that is sweet. Raw cleaned carrots are sweet. As well (if you can eat them)<BR>
sweet spanish onions fried in some olive oil are very sweet or even raw.<BR>
Most all fruit will give you a blood sugar lift. Three or four sweet grapes<BR>
will help. These foods should be spread out during the day and not try to<BR>
make a meal only of them. I fortunately can eat large amounts of raw apples<BR>
oranges and rip bannanas.<BR>
In the early stages of the diet I woul;d not advice fruit juices, unless it<BR>
is made by yourself. The rule being Donot Trust Labels. &gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Hope this may be of help to someone.<BR>
<BR>
Good health<BR>
<BR>

Prateeksha: Yes, as a matter of fact, I've been told this by my doctor<BR>
several times and have read it in several medical manuals. This is the<BR>
reason doctors prescribe immunosuppressant drugs such as Immuran/MP-6, etc.<BR>
 From what I understand, the docs leave these drugs until last, after<BR>
prednisone and other treatments, as they can reap havoc on your immune<BR>
system.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;No, I never had bowel surgery. I have only known I have CD for a couple<BR>
of weeks, although I suspect I had it for at least 2 years. My upper GI and<BR>
small bowel came up clean a few months ago. The CD is only in my large<BR>
intestine (several places).<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you think I could use Questran anyway? Or do I have to have small<BR>
intestine CD to benefit from it? I am seeing my doctor in 2 weeks. He<BR>
usually suggests Metamusil, but I have been using straight psyllium. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Any imput?<BR>

Simone,<BR>

Have you had small bowel problems or a small bowel resection? The last part<BR>
of the small bowel<BR>
absorbs vitamin B12 (so shots are required) but also reabsorbs bile salts so<BR>
that they can be <BR>
recycled. The problem is that without that portion of the small bowel, the<BR>
bile salts go right on<BR>
into the large intestine and cause diarrhea. I recently had my 2nd resection<BR>
(first was 30 years ago)<BR>
and the D just wasn't going away. My doctor prescribed Questran which binds<BR>
up the bile salts<BR>
so that they aren't active when they get into the large intestine. Wow! What<BR>
a difference. <BR>
Psyllium had helped only a little, but the Questran fixed things right up.<BR>
Have only been on it<BR>
for a few days and am still working on what dosage I need, but it looks like<BR>
a modest amount<BR>
in the evening is all I need.<BR>

the same question, and 9 of the people present remarked that they had also<BR>
noted this surprising finding in their own lives.<BR>
<BR>
- 1 reported having more <BR>
<BR>
- 1 was undecided<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Additional findings / thoughts that were contributed:<BR>
- because IBD appears to increase the activity of the immune system, this<BR>
could be one reason why IBD sufferers get fewer colds / flus<BR>
<BR>
- colds / flus increased for those people who were / had recently been on<BR>
immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. prednisone)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So overall there APPEARS to be a clear indication that people who have IBD<BR>
are likely to have much fewer colds or flus.<BR>
<BR>
Interesting. Let's file it away &quot;in the back of our minds&quot; for future<BR>
reference ... maybe there's a genius in our midst or just lurking who will<BR>
one day make all the pieces fit?!<BR>

Simone,<BR>
I am not exactly sure how long of a time frame it took for my D to subside<BR>
once I started taking the psyllium capsules. I my memory serves me right, I<BR>
first started with the psyllium a few weeks before I started the SCD (I<BR>
wasn't aware of the SCD Diet) and I wasn't eating any wheat, but I was eating<BR>
rice. I still had some D, but it was a great improvement. Now that I am using<BR>
both, (psyllium &amp; SCD) I don't have a problem with D at all! I take 2<BR>
capsules 2x/day with a meal along with other vitamin and mineral supplements.<BR>
I also take Pentasa (4 3x/day) I cut myself back from taking the Pentasa 4<BR>
4x/day and so far things are working great! The psyllium I take is from<BR>
&quot;Nature's Sunshine&quot; and the bottle says, &quot;Plantago psyllium - 600 mg (9.22<BR>
grains) each.&quot; I am not sure what qty. of the powder is equal to one capsule.<BR>
I hope I've helped you on this one. <BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
I just recently tried the lasagna recipe that Elaine has in her book and it<BR>
didn't really turn out that well. It was runny and kind of bland. I was<BR>
just wondering if anyone else has tried it with more success or it anyone<BR>
has a better recipe that I could try.<BR>
Also, I'm looking for ways to cook spaghetti squash other than with tomato<BR>
sauce. Sometimes I can get 4 or 5 servings from one squash and living by<BR>
myself I find that eating spaghetti squash with tomato sauce every night<BR>
before the squash has a chance to go bad can get kind of boring.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

Subject: food combining<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;m0xNdO6-003KfqC@iaw.on.ca&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I've read a lot on this list about food combining lately and I must admit I<BR>
am getting confused, just like I did while reading the book Fit for Life.<BR>
Food does need an optimal pH in order for the digestive enzymes that act on<BR>
it to work properly, but the body takes care of that on it's own. The<BR>
stomach is acidic and optimal for the digestion of proteins but then when<BR>
the partially digested food leaves the stomach and enters the small<BR>
intestine, the pH is neutralized and brought to the ideal level for the<BR>
enzymes that break down carbohydrates to work. Fat is also digested in the<BR>
small intestines with the help of bile and fat digesting enzymes.<BR>
So why do we need to worry about eating certain foods in combination when<BR>
nature has already taken care of that for us? And would fruit really<BR>
petrify just because it's sitting in the stomach not being digested,<BR>
wouldn't something else be required for it to go bad that quickly? Also, I<BR>
read that when you eat raw fruits and vegetables, they actually contain, in<BR>
the food themselves, enzymes that will digest them.<BR>
These are just a few problems that I had when I read the book. I don't know<BR>
if I'm way off base here. Does anyone have any comments?<BR>
Also, the talk about how fast things move through our digestive system. I<BR>
think that a big part of that is how long they need to remain in the<BR>
stomach, which is obviously the longest for protein since this is where it<BR>
is digested. But once it enters the small intestine it would be in the form<BR>
of amino acids, and I don't think it would be capable of slowing down the<BR>
movement of food eaten a few hours later. It's important to keep in mind<BR>
the state of the food moving through our system and not picture a big piece<BR>
of steak working its way through. I think that it's actually pretty much in<BR>
liquid form shortly after leaving the stomach.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Tina<BR>

&gt;I was glad to hear it as a 4 or 7 day rotation diet has to be a major<BR>
pain!<BR>
&gt;What do others on the list think?<BR>
<BR>
I'm not medically inclined, an ex-sufferer of UC on the diet still. I<BR>
think that there is a great deal of &quot;power&quot; in our beliefs. This is the<BR>
only explanation I can find for why many of us react so differently to<BR>
different foods, or combinations of foods. For me, I've chosen to<BR>
&quot;believe&quot; that the diet in the book will eventually cure me. So far,<BR>
the going has been slow (as stipulated in the book) but has been<BR>
sucessful. There are days when certain foods seem to bother me, but I'm<BR>
not going to devote too much effort or worry in trying to figure it<BR>
out. I share alot of my experience on this list, and pay attention to<BR>
what others have discovered - recently I've suspected that I've been<BR>
eating too much almond flour, and I've felf a bit bloated, but I expect<BR>
it to subside. I think that subconsciously, I &quot;adapt&quot; or adjust to the<BR>
subtle reactions my body has to different foods. I believe this is more<BR>
likely to occur the less I pay attention to it. This means that I &quot;lay<BR>
off&quot; certain allwable foods often for no valid reason, but I don't think<BR>
about it too much. There's enough other stuff I can eat until I feel<BR>
comfortable with whatever I may have suspected was bothering me. Sort<BR>
of by keeping my head down, plodding along with the diet, thankful that<BR>
there is someting I can do &quot;proactively&quot; to fight off this UC. I've<BR>
thought about carrying a picture around in my wallet of me when I was<BR>
really sick, sitting on the loo, which at one time was my &quot;throne&quot; as a<BR>
reminder of the progress I have made. As well as I am, the urge to cheat<BR>
comes up frequently, as I start taking my health for granted....<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;2.2.16.19971021065542.26df3ae8@megamed.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Yesterday was my son's Day Three on the diet. I have him on the diet to<BR>
overcome bowel problems and hypoactive type autism.<BR>
<BR>
I am not giving ground nuts yet, mostly steamed veggies, some raw veggies,<BR>
some meat, some chicken soup, a tiny, tiny bit of fruit. This little guy<BR>
is a champ when it comes to vegetables, let me tell you! [I tried a little<BR>
banana, a little boiled egg, he is still not ready for these foods yet.]<BR>
<BR>
The biggest difference I noticed yesterday was he seemed to have bursts of<BR>
energy. This is unusual, as he has been hypoactive for so long. Also, fewer<BR>
tantrums, less talking to himself.<BR>
<BR>
I got a lot more eye contact. <BR>
<BR>
Also, he used to have &quot;accidents&quot; with number 2, we could not figure it out,<BR>
because he is potty trained. These &quot;accidents&quot; have stopped. I used to be<BR>
changing him and washing underwear 2 times a day or more, my clothes washer<BR>
told me it was exhausted!<BR>
<BR>
Today it is early and is Day Four, will let you guys know what happens. I<BR>
can tell you with certainty that I have never heard of this diet before for<BR>
neurological symptoms like autism. The parents on the Autism list, not all<BR>
of them, but many of them, have the kids on very, very strong psychoactive<BR>
drugs. It would be nice to get these kids off these powerful drugs. I have<BR>
already posted the 800 number for Elaine's book on the Autism list.<BR>
<BR>
Many kids show autistic type symptoms because they have been on lots of<BR>
antibiotics and have lost all or most of their &quot;good&quot; flora and intestinal<BR>
toxins go from their bowels to their little brains. Then the child is taken<BR>
to the MD who puts the child on various drugs with very long names.<BR>
<BR>
On the Autism List, one parent will write: Dr So and So gave me a super drug<BR>
to get my child to sleep at night.<BR>
<BR>
The next parent writes, How do I contact Dr So and So? I want to get my<BR>
child on that drug!<BR>
<BR>
And on it goes. These so called autistic kids can't sleep, they have<BR>
bowel/diarrhea problems, these kids are sick physically, NOT MENTALLY.<BR>
<BR>
Almost the entire medical system treats them like MENTAL cases. I was told<BR>
that if I just got my kid enough behavior therapy, he would be cured. Phooey!<BR>

I have not tried the lasagne and I have also prepared the spaghetti squash<BR>
recipe. Just wanted<BR>
to let you know that what I have done is separated the left overs in<BR>
individual Tupperware<BR>
containers (the kind that can go in the freezer and then in the microwave).<BR>
I put some squash on<BR>
the bottom and some of the meat sauce on top and put them in the freezer.<BR>
Either myself or my<BR>
husband take these to work for lunches. They heat up great. That way you<BR>
can them out a few<BR>
days and not get sick of spaghetti.<BR>

Hypoglycaemia, or as we now know it is a Low Blood Sugar condition<BR>
Linda you touched on a subject dear to my heart. I have lived most of my<BR>
long life with this condition. Only learned in the past fifteen years why<BR>
I<BR>
had such wide mood swings, with some days barely being able to raise my<BR>
head long enough to growl at any and everyone. A total lack of energy with<BR>
complete exhaustion, yet the next day I might feel I could walk on water,<BR>
h<BR>
aving bountless energy. Sugar can lift me to the highest degree of euphoria<BR>
imaginable, followed by a devastating low.<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the scd for near five years now and find I must be careful<BR>
to<BR>
include some sugars ( not refined) in my day to day meals. To combat the<BR>
hypoglycaemia , a reasonable sugar level must be maintained. Somewhere<BR>
during the day I will eat the following foods for just that<BR>
reason.--------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
&gt;feel shaky. Is that normal?<BR>
Two or three cooking dates with some nuts for a quick pickup, and or a<BR>
apple<BR>
that is sweet. Raw cleaned carrots are sweet. As well (if you can eat them)<BR>
sweet spanish onions fried in some olive oil are very sweet or even raw.<BR>
Most all fruit will give you a blood sugar lift. Three or four sweet grapes<BR>
will help. These foods should be spread out during the day and not try to<BR>
make a meal only of them. I fortunately can eat large amounts of raw apples<BR>
oranges and rip bannanas.<BR>
In the early stages of the diet I woul;d not advice fruit juices, unless it<BR>
is made by yourself. The rule being Donot Trust Labels. &gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Hope this may be of help to someone.<BR>

Good health<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In regards to what you wrote:<BR>
<BR>
Well, I have been getting better and better...less pain, cramping, gas,<BR>
bloating, diarrhea. So, recently, I decided to go for one of the recipes<BR>
in the book, using cooked apples. I changed the recipe a bit. Mixed<BR>
almond flour with butter, salt and cinnamon and put over the tart sliced,<BR>
cored apples and baked in the oven until the apples were done. So<BR>
delicious, I can't tell you, BUT...every time I ate a helping (as a snack,<BR>
not with meals), In just a little while I started with the pain, gas,<BR>
bloating, swelling! I stopped eating the apple crisp concoction and no<BR>
more pain, gas, bloating and swelling. Started eating apple crisp<BR>
concoction agAin, and the same symptoms appeared. I tried this 3 times<BR>
just to see and it was the same each time!!! What an experiment. Fruit<BR>
mixed with protein for me, does not work, at least at this point!!!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see the protein in here. Proteins that are not allowed with<BR>
fruit according to the Fit for Life book, are animal protein (meat and<BR>
cheese). Nuts are vegetable protein, and they are safe with fruit.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Although, also according to Fit for Life, fruit that are cooked and with<BR>
added sweetner are more acidic and more likely to cause bloating and<BR>
fermentation. Maybe that is your problem. Aside from perhaps that the fruit<BR>
itself causing problems???<BR>

When you take the psyllium, do you take a lot of water with it? Psyllium<BR>
powder has to be taken with lots of fluid (10 oz.). If you take this with<BR>
a meal, does that mean that the digestive juices are getting diluted? I<BR>
always get confused, about taking supplements &quot;with a meal&quot; because that<BR>
means, &quot;fluid&quot; also and I try to stay away from fluids at mealtime so that<BR>
my food will have a better opportunity to digest. Consequently, I end up<BR>
taking supplements about 30 mins. after the meal or before.<BR>
<BR>
Thoughts on this?<BR>

&gt;Simone,<BR>
&gt;I am not exactly sure how long of a time frame it took for my D to subside<BR>
&gt;once I started taking the psyllium capsules. I my memory serves me right, I<BR>
&gt;first started with the psyllium a few weeks before I started the SCD (I<BR>
&gt;wasn't aware of the SCD Diet) and I wasn't eating any wheat, but I was eating<BR>
&gt;rice. I still had some D, but it was a great improvement. Now that I am using<BR>
&gt;both, (psyllium &amp; SCD) I don't have a problem with D at all! I take 2<BR>
&gt;capsules 2x/day with a meal along with other vitamin and mineral supplements.<BR>
&gt;I also take Pentasa (4 3x/day) I cut myself back from taking the Pentasa 4<BR>
&gt;4x/day and so far things are working great! The psyllium I take is from<BR>
&gt;&quot;Nature's Sunshine&quot; and the bottle says, &quot;Plantago psyllium - 600 mg (9.22<BR>
&gt;grains) each.&quot; I am not sure what qty. of the powder is equal to one capsule.<BR>
&gt;I hope I've helped you on this one.<BR>

&gt;Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Tina,<BR>
<BR>
re spaghetti squash, I also live alone and have experienced the same as<BR>
you; however, I find this squash is very soothing to my guts, so I eat the<BR>
rest of it after the sauce is exhausted, with roasted chicken pieces ontop<BR>
and some of the &quot;gelee&quot; over that and microwave. Delicious, along with<BR>
English peas, or some other green.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I just recently tried the lasagna recipe that Elaine has in her book and it<BR>
&gt;didn't really turn out that well. It was runny and kind of bland. I was<BR>
&gt;just wondering if anyone else has tried it with more success or it anyone<BR>
&gt;has a better recipe that I could try.<BR>
&gt;Also, I'm looking for ways to cook spaghetti squash other than with tomato<BR>
&gt;sauce. Sometimes I can get 4 or 5 servings from one squash and living by<BR>
&gt;myself I find that eating spaghetti squash with tomato sauce every night<BR>
&gt;before the squash has a chance to go bad can get kind of boring.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks,<BR>

Dear Matthew:<BR>
<BR>
Thank you so much for your thoughts about the diet/food intolerance. I<BR>
feel you have very valid points to make and in fact, your attitude is what<BR>
I &quot;hear&quot; when I read Elaine's remarks, about just &quot;do&quot; the diet and let it<BR>
heal you. She has such confidence in it.<BR>
<BR>
I am slowly progressing and it is time for me to move into &quot;faith&quot; and<BR>
&quot;trust&quot; that this diet will CONTINUE TO WORK. Why shouldn't it?<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha (spiritual name, means: &quot;Waiting&quot;.) Isn't that a kick?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;I was glad to hear it as a 4 or 7 day rotation diet has to be a major<BR>
&gt;pain!<BR>
&gt;&gt;What do others on the list think?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm not medically inclined, an ex-sufferer of UC on the diet still. I<BR>
&gt;think that there is a great deal of &quot;power&quot; in our beliefs. This is the<BR>
&gt;only explanation I can find for why many of us react so differently to<BR>
&gt;different foods, or combinations of foods. For me, I've chosen to<BR>
&gt;&quot;believe&quot; that the diet in the book will eventually cure me. So far,<BR>
&gt;the going has been slow (as stipulated in the book) but has been<BR>
&gt;sucessful. There are days when certain foods seem to bother me, but I'm<BR>
&gt;not going to devote too much effort or worry in trying to figure it<BR>
&gt;out. I share alot of my experience on this list, and pay attention to<BR>
&gt;what others have discovered - recently I've suspected that I've been<BR>
&gt;eating too much almond flour, and I've felf a bit bloated, but I expect<BR>
&gt;it to subside. I think that subconsciously, I &quot;adapt&quot; or adjust to the<BR>
&gt;subtle reactions my body has to different foods. I believe this is more<BR>
&gt;likely to occur the less I pay attention to it. This means that I &quot;lay<BR>
&gt;off&quot; certain allwable foods often for no valid reason, but I don't think<BR>
&gt;about it too much. There's enough other stuff I can eat until I feel<BR>
&gt;comfortable with whatever I may have suspected was bothering me. Sort<BR>
&gt;of by keeping my head down, plodding along with the diet, thankful that<BR>
&gt;there is someting I can do &quot;proactively&quot; to fight off this UC. I've<BR>
&gt;thought about carrying a picture around in my wallet of me when I was<BR>
&gt;really sick, sitting on the loo, which at one time was my &quot;throne&quot; as a<BR>
&gt;reminder of the progress I have made. As well as I am, the urge to cheat<BR>
&gt;comes up frequently, as I start taking my health for granted....<BR>

Now on Day Four, I am getting a lot of speech, I am holding my breath,<BR>
almost afraid to talk about it!<BR>
<BR>
My question is, my son still laughs at weird times. Not a whole lot, but say<BR>
you are riding in the car, he will start laughing to himself inappropriately<BR>
and acting silly. Would this be yeast toxins or &quot;bad' bacteria toxins?<BR>
<BR>
Right now he is upstairs asking the tutor over and over, Do you want to play<BR>
with me? I am hearing more and better speech. More alertness, improvement<BR>
overall.<BR>
<BR>
Mind you I have spent over two years and tons of money trying to get him<BR>
better. This diet is working so far. I am very cautiously optimistic.<BR>
<BR>
I had him gluten free which helped, but this diet is getting rid of all<BR>
starches and no longer feeding the bad bacteria.<BR>

Dear Simone,<BR>
<BR>
thanks for your reply. I did add honey to the mixture, so maybe that is<BR>

pain.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your insight.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In regards to what you wrote:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Well, I have been getting better and better...less pain, cramping, gas,<BR>
&gt;bloating, diarrhea. So, recently, I decided to go for one of the recipes<BR>
&gt;in the book, using cooked apples. I changed the recipe a bit. Mixed<BR>
&gt;almond flour with butter, salt and cinnamon and put over the tart sliced,<BR>
&gt;cored apples and baked in the oven until the apples were done. So<BR>
&gt;delicious, I can't tell you, BUT...every time I ate a helping (as a snack,<BR>
&gt;not with meals), In just a little while I started with the pain, gas,<BR>
&gt;bloating, swelling! I stopped eating the apple crisp concoction and no<BR>
&gt;more pain, gas, bloating and swelling. Started eating apple crisp<BR>
&gt;concoction agAin, and the same symptoms appeared. I tried this 3 times<BR>
&gt;just to see and it was the same each time!!! What an experiment. Fruit<BR>
&gt;mixed with protein for me, does not work, at least at this point!!!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see the protein in here. Proteins that are not allowed with<BR>
&gt;fruit according to the Fit for Life book, are animal protein (meat and<BR>
&gt;cheese). Nuts are vegetable protein, and they are safe with fruit.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Although, also according to Fit for Life, fruit that are cooked and with<BR>
&gt;added sweetner are more acidic and more likely to cause bloating and<BR>
&gt;fermentation. Maybe that is your problem. Aside from perhaps that the fruit<BR>
&gt;itself causing problems???<BR>

I know I read somewhere here that Elaine does not have a high regard for<BR>
the Rotation Diet concept. Someone else may have the details.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding our beliefs being powerful, I certainly agree because what we<BR>
believe, affects what we actually DO. However, I must confess that I<BR>
started out on SCD not believing that it would necessarily work, in<BR>
fact, I was very skeptical (but desperate), particularly of fruits, as I<BR>
had taught to deeply believe that Fruits would either &quot;feed my candida<BR>
or bring them back&quot;. I tried them with fear and trepidation. Seeing,<BR>
though became believing as I began to improve. Believing came after<BR>
seeing in this case. <BR>
<BR>
One can believe all they want that they are on the train to New York but<BR>
if they are actually on the one to Philly, to Philly they will go.<BR>
Under the Candida diet, I really believed I could eat things like rice<BR>
and yeast free bread but I always had longstanding and severe problems<BR>
on that diet regardless of my strong belief.<BR>
<BR>
It seems to me, our beliefs are the most powerful when we actually<BR>
believe something that is TRUE.<BR>
<BR>
For what it's worth...<BR>

Congratulations Moira. This is remarkable! Please keep letting us know<BR>
his progress! <BR>
<BR>
I will say that I have personally experienced very, very weird and<BR>
disturbing mental, emotional stuff going on inside of me when I have had<BR>
GI tract flare ups. Also, I experience sleep disturbances every time.<BR>
These simply go away as my GI problems calm back down. Sometimes, after<BR>
eating a complex carbo meal, I seemed to be able to literally feel<BR>
toxins hitting my brain and nervous system. It was not until SCD that I<BR>
finally made the full connection to ALL complex carbos and undigested<BR>
complex sugars. I have been amazed at how quickly, (23 days now), these<BR>
weird symptoms have simply gone away. Under the candida protocol, with<BR>
anti-fungal meds and diet etc, I would eventually get better, but it<BR>
would take at least 4 to 8 months each time.<BR>
<BR>
Keep plugging away. You may well be witnessing a miracle that could<BR>
change the lives of many on you Autism Listserv and beyond!<BR>

&gt; Yesterday was my son's Day Three on the diet. I have him on the diet<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; overcome bowel problems and hypoactive type autism.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I am not giving ground nuts yet, mostly steamed veggies, some raw<BR>
&gt; veggies,<BR>
&gt; some meat, some chicken soup, a tiny, tiny bit of fruit. This little<BR>
&gt; guy<BR>
&gt; is a champ when it comes to vegetables, let me tell you! [I tried a<BR>
&gt; little<BR>
&gt; banana, a little boiled egg, he is still not ready for these foods<BR>
&gt; yet.]<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The biggest difference I noticed yesterday was he seemed to have<BR>
&gt; bursts of<BR>
&gt; energy. This is unusual, as he has been hypoactive for so long. Also,<BR>
&gt; fewer<BR>
&gt; tantrums, less talking to himself.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I got a lot more eye contact. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, he used to have &quot;accidents&quot; with number 2, we could not figure<BR>
&gt; it out,<BR>
&gt; because he is potty trained. These &quot;accidents&quot; have stopped. I used to<BR>
&gt; be<BR>
&gt; changing him and washing underwear 2 times a day or more, my clothes<BR>
&gt; washer<BR>
&gt; told me it was exhausted!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Today it is early and is Day Four, will let you guys know what<BR>
&gt; happens. I<BR>
&gt; can tell you with certainty that I have never heard of this diet<BR>
&gt; before for<BR>
&gt; neurological symptoms like autism. The parents on the Autism list, not<BR>
&gt; all<BR>
&gt; of them, but many of them, have the kids on very, very strong<BR>
&gt; psychoactive<BR>
&gt; drugs. It would be nice to get these kids off these powerful drugs. I<BR>
&gt; have<BR>
&gt; already posted the 800 number for Elaine's book on the Autism list.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Many kids show autistic type symptoms because they have been on lots<BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; antibiotics and have lost all or most of their &quot;good&quot; flora and<BR>
&gt; intestinal<BR>
&gt; toxins go from their bowels to their little brains. Then the child is<BR>
&gt; taken<BR>
&gt; to the MD who puts the child on various drugs with very long names.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; On the Autism List, one parent will write: Dr So and So gave me a<BR>
&gt; super drug<BR>
&gt; to get my child to sleep at night.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The next parent writes, How do I contact Dr So and So? I want to get<BR>
&gt; my<BR>
&gt; child on that drug!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; And on it goes. These so called autistic kids can't sleep, they have<BR>
&gt; bowel/diarrhea problems, these kids are sick physically, NOT MENTALLY.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Almost the entire medical system treats them like MENTAL cases. I was<BR>
&gt; told<BR>
&gt; that if I just got my kid enough behavior therapy, he would be cured.<BR>
&gt; Phooey!<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
I just recently tried the lasagna recipe that Elaine has in her book and =<BR>
it<BR>
didn't really turn out that well. It was runny and kind of bland. I =<BR>
was<BR>
just wondering if anyone else has tried it with more success or it =<BR>
anyone<BR>
has a better recipe that I could try.<BR>
Also, I'm looking for ways to cook spaghetti squash other than with =<BR>
tomato<BR>
sauce. Sometimes I can get 4 or 5 servings from one squash and living =<BR>
by<BR>
myself I find that eating spaghetti squash with tomato sauce every night<BR>
before the squash has a chance to go bad can get kind of boring.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

seems the first couple of weeks went better than now. i have been on the diet<BR>
about a month or so and seems i have much more bloating. i dont even eat like<BR>
i should because of it. what i HAVE noticed is less irritation of the gut and<BR>
MORE bloating. <BR>

All this talk about colds has reminded me of something that I've noticed<BR>
since being diagnosed with IBD. I haven't gotten nearly as many cold sores<BR>
as I used to get. I don't really understand why this happens, but since it<BR>
is a virus as well I thought it might be a similar phenomenon.<BR>
I know one time in this group someone mentioned something about the body<BR>
having almost a weak link, or a stress point. So when you are stressed it<BR>
manifests itself in a certain way depending on what your weak point is. I<BR>
guess maybe the weak point is different for everyone and maybe it can change.<BR>

To minimize the evaporation keep the lid on<BR>
 the pan while you are heating<BR>
the milk up on the stove. Remove the lid only when you want to stir it.<BR>
 I find it heats up faster using<BR>
a lid, so that's a plus. Use a pan that is <BR>
larger than what you need in case it starts boiling it won't end up all <BR>
over the stove. <BR>
Also, the Yogourmet will hold a little more than 2 quarts. You could make<BR>
it <BR>
with an extra cup as long as it all fits in the tub. Remember to use a<BR>
little <BR>
extra starter for the extra cup. <BR>
If you want to make a huge amount at once either buy a second yogurt<BR>
maker, or use the oven method. <BR>
Good luck (you're bound to get this figured out sooner or later!)<BR>
Lucy<BR>
PS You can also buy an extra container for your Yogourmet. I've <BR>
got one on order right now. Thank you Partridge's for that suggestion.<BR>

Hi Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
I just did something recently that has made a huge difference in my<BR>
fibromyalgia symptoms. Maybe you have already heard of people taking<BR>
magnesium and malic acid supplements? I recently found out what the<BR>
recommended dosages for FM were, and tried during the last week it with<BR>
great success. No acheyness to speak of. Plus I used to have this knot<BR>
in my jaw that has completley gone away for the first time in years. In<BR>
case you want to know the dosages recommend for fibromyalgia, here they<BR>
are:<BR>
<BR>
300 - 600 mg. magnesium<BR>
1200 - 1400 mg. malic acid<BR>
<BR>
I have been using a supplement that combines both. It's called<BR>
Magnesium Malate Forte, by the company called Allergy Research.<BR>
<BR>
Just thought I would share. If you haven't tried this, it's really<BR>
worth a try.<BR>

&gt; &gt;&quot;One doctor actually told me that the reason he hadn't taken me<BR>
&gt; &gt;seriously was because I was well put together and well spoken when he<BR>
&gt; &gt;saw me. It was hard for him to understand that this is a part of who I<BR>
&gt; &gt;am, and doesn't mean I'm not in pain!&quot;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; To all that have chimed in with dittos to this one, please include me! I've<BR>
&gt; had doctors tell me the exact same thing almost word for word. I am also a<BR>
&gt; person who refuses to let pain run my life. I come across strong and<BR>
&gt; healthy. I guess its hard to take me seriously when I claim to be in agony<BR>
&gt; even though I've just worked 8 hours, taken a martial arts class, done my<BR>
&gt; housework and made sure dinner was on the table. It just makes me want to<BR>
&gt; scream with frustration when a doctor refuses to take you seriously because<BR>
&gt; you are stoic and won't succumb to the pain. I was on nortryptaline for a<BR>
&gt; while for the FM, but its usefullness was shortlived. I kept having to take<BR>
&gt; more and more with less and less results. I finally gave up on it. I take a<BR>
&gt; lot of tylonal and when the pain becomes unbearable, I take a percocet<BR>
&gt; (maybe once or twice a month). As for the asocal VS azulphadine, I was on<BR>
&gt; azulphadine for about 8 years total and it did help. I guess its been about<BR>
&gt; a year and 1/2 since I stopped taking anything for my UC ( no reason to)<BR>

It doesn't sound like Questran would really be indicated for you. The purpose of it is to<BR>
bind up bile acids that are getting through into the large intestine due to small bowel <BR>
problems (diseased or missing). The stuff is relatively innocuous but it does have a<BR>
tendency to bind up fat based vitamins such as ADEK. Wouldn't hurt to ask your doctor<BR>
about it though.<BR>

Calcium, of course, you know what that is: a mineral, and it's OK.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Stearate&quot; means &quot;stearic acid&quot; (which gets its name because it either<BR>
comes from or smells like beef fat, I believe); it's a saturated fatty acid.<BR>

Calcium stearate is used as filler &amp; stabilizer; I would say it's OK.<BR>

Hi, Tina:<BR>

I like your analysis of the food combining puzzle ... whether it's worth<BR>

<BR>
Read on ....<BR>

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;I've read a lot on this list about food combining lately and I must admit I<BR>
&gt;am getting confused, just like I did while reading the book Fit for Life.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Food does need an optimal pH in order for the digestive enzymes that act on<BR>
&gt;it to work properly, but the body takes care of that on its own. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One theory is that when a person's system is out of homeostasis (&quot;out of<BR>
balance&quot; aka &quot;ill&quot;), the body does NOT / can NOT take care of achieving<BR>
optimal pH.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The<BR>
&gt;stomach is acidic and optimal for the digestion of proteins but then when<BR>
&gt;the partially digested food leaves the stomach and enters the small<BR>
&gt;intestine, the pH is neutralized and brought to the ideal level for the<BR>
&gt;enzymes that break down carbohydrates to work. Fat is also digested in the<BR>
&gt;small intestines with the help of bile and fat digesting enzymes.<BR>
<BR>
Good overview. Apparently starches are also already being attacked by<BR>
enzymes from glands in the mouth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;So why do we need to worry about eating certain foods in combination when<BR>
&gt;nature has already taken care of that for us? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As I said, perhaps to &quot;give a helping hand&quot; to an ailing system????<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;And would fruit really<BR>
&gt;petrify <BR>
<BR>
PU-trify. As in &quot;putrefaction&quot;, as in &quot;rotting away&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;just because it's sitting in the stomach not being digested,<BR>
<BR>
Actually, it's protein that would putrify if it's not being properly<BR>
digested; fruits &amp; starches would ferment. But anyway ...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;wouldn't something else be required for it to go bad that quickly? <BR>
<BR>
No. I believe things can &quot;rot&quot; &amp; &quot;ferment&quot; as soon as the body's natural<BR>
digestive processes are aborted / malfunctioning because of the bacteria in<BR>
the foods themselves &amp; in the body. I look at it as a sort of race: if the<BR>
body's &quot;good guys&quot; don't get to work on it first &amp; in the manner Nature<BR>
meant them to, then the &quot;bad guys&quot; (in the food &amp; in the body) win the race<BR>
and THEY do their thing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Also, I<BR>
&gt;read that when you eat raw fruits and vegetables, they actually contain, in<BR>
&gt;the food themselves, enzymes that will digest them.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, that's what is said. And that to me would be another reason to eat<BR>
them first: because these are the most easily-digested foods, thus the most<BR>
active enzymes, you want to allow them &quot;the green light&quot; instead of making<BR>
them wait behind the slow-moving proteins &amp; fats; even though the stomach<BR>
DOES churn all the stuff in it into one &quot;mash&quot;, perhaps if the proteins<BR>
arrive first the body will produce the proteinases (protein-eating enyzmes)<BR>
first, and say &quot;never mind to the fruit &amp; starch enzymes, we'll get to them<BR>
later&quot;, thus settting the stage for bad digestion of fruits / veggies /<BR>
starches???<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;These are just a few problems that I had when I read the book. I don't know<BR>
&gt;if I'm way off base here. <BR>
<BR>
Neither do I. I'm just going by things I know from my physiology courses,<BR>
trying to see how some of these theories COULD be explained logically.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Does anyone have any comments?<BR>
<BR>
Yep, you just read 'em, dear!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Also, the talk about how fast things move through our digestive system. I<BR>
&gt;think that a big part of that is how long they need to remain in the<BR>
&gt;stomach, which is obviously the longest for protein since this is where it<BR>
&gt;is digested. But once it enters the small intestine it would be in the form<BR>
&gt;of amino acids, and I don't think it would be capable of slowing down the<BR>
&gt;movement of food eaten a few hours later. <BR>
<BR>
No comment, I don't know.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It's important to keep in mind<BR>
&gt;the state of the food moving through our system and not picture a big piece<BR>
&gt;of steak working its way through. I think that it's actually pretty much in<BR>
&gt;liquid form shortly after leaving the stomach.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, as I previously mentioned, it's a &quot;mush&quot; called &quot;chyme&quot; when it leaves<BR>
the stomach; the normal human stomach does not allow the food coming in<BR>
from the mouth to exit out until it has a specific consistency &amp; pH<BR>
(acid/base balance).<BR>
<BR>

&quot;Stearate&quot; is a form (&quot;an ester or salt of ...&quot;, to be specific, but don't<BR>
worry about the technicalities) of stearic acid, which is (according to<BR>
Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary) &quot;a white, fatty acid found in solid<BR>
animal fats and a few vegetable fats&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
I don't think it conflicts with any of the SCD rules; and the amounts found<BR>
in the pills are probably not going to do any harm, even if the stuff WERE<BR>
harmful.<BR>

I do take all of my vitamin and herb supplements with ALOT of water. But that<BR>
is usually the only time I do drink all that water. The bottle of psyllium<BR>
capsules recommends to take the two capsules with a meal twice daily. I<BR>
usually end up taking all of these supplements toward the end of my meal or<BR>
after I have finished eating. The Herbalist that I go to specifically gave me<BR>
the psyllium for the &quot;D&quot;, but from the information I have gathered, the<BR>
psyllium can also be helpful to those who have the opposite problem of<BR>
constipation. But, in order for that to happen, I think that alot of fluid is<BR>
necessary as well. That is why I don't go heavy on my fluid intake other than<BR>
when necessary.<BR>
I regard to my digestive juices getting diluted, I don't seem to have a<BR>
problem with my food digesting. I guess I am pretty lucky.<BR>

you will have to re-ask your question because it is not clear to me. what do<BR>
you mean what are colemas made of? (and no, i do not like comparing them to<BR>

I'm so happy for you and your son that you are trying this diet. As a mother<BR>

I do too. I usually wake up in the early morning hours with pain in my<BR>

I also seem to contract less colds/flu then people around me.<BR>
However, when I was younger (up to age 17) I had constant allergies, asthma, etc and always seemed to be catching a cold or at least blowing my nose. All of these systems subsided (no asthma sprays, no allergy shots, no more raising the stock prices of Kleenex) when I stopped drinking milk (used to drink close to 1 gallon/day) and avoided cheese (there are many amazing pizza places in my area). However, these diet modifications were a response to being diagnosed w/ UC.<BR>

<BR>
Here is a little lighter version of the Lois Lang bread.<BR>
<BR>
3 cups almond flour<BR>
1 tsp baking soda<BR>
3/4 tsp salt<BR>
3 TBL melted butter (just under 1/2 stick)<BR>
3/4 cup dry curd cottage chesse<BR>
2 eggs<BR>
1/2 cup water<BR>
1 TBL caraway seeds (optional) <BR>
<BR>
Put the almond flour in a large bowl. Process the eggs, ddcc, butter,<BR>
baking soda, salt, and water together until smooth. Stir processed <BR>
mixture into the almond flour with a large spoon. Scoop batter <BR>
into buttered loaf pans filling 3/4 full. Bake at 340F until done.<BR>
 <BR>
I use the small loaf pans (51/2&quot;X3&quot;) that you buy in sets of 4. <BR>
Because they are smaller the loaves come of the pans very easily, <BR>
NEVER tearing. Also, because of the smaller size the middle cooks <BR>
up well. I quadruple the above recipe, and freeze most of it. It usually <BR>
lasts about 3 months.<BR>
<BR>
PS. For any of you who have made the Lois Lang bread and decided <BR>
you don't like it, try toasting it. I don't particularly like it unless<BR>
it's <BR>
toasted. To make crackers out of the slices put them on a tray or<BR>
foil on low heat in the toaster oven and bake until crisp. <BR>

Message-ID: &lt;3.0.1.32.19971022134511.006a4e64@smartt.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Some thoughts that came to me after sending off the survey results to the<BR>
question &quot;Do you (an IBD'er) get more or fewer colds / flus than the people<BR>
around you?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to findings from our (admittedly small) sample group:<BR>
<BR>
- the ability to ward off colds / flus by people with coliltis / Crohn's<BR>
does NOT appear to be gender-linked, i.e. both the men &amp; the women in our<BR>
group appear to possess the same ability<BR>
<BR>
- if (as it appears) IBD'ers have the ability to decrease / prevent getting<BR>
colds &amp; flues, this must mean there IS a &quot;cure&quot; for the common cold &amp; flus<BR>
(despite the medical industry's frequent chant that &quot;There is no cure for<BR>
the common cold&quot;), and that this ability is NOT dependent on pills &amp; shots<BR>
but rather something in our bodies' systems.<BR>
<BR>
- because all who participated are IBDers, while at the same time NOT<BR>
getting as many colds/flus as the non-IBD-ers in their environment, one<BR>
could hypothesize that the processes of IBD and the processes of colds/flu<BR>
infection are somehow &quot;opposite&quot; in their mechanism ... if one could only<BR>
understand what &quot;opposite&quot; means in a biological sense!<BR>
<BR>
I know these points sound very technical, but I wanted to just &quot;get them<BR>
out there&quot; ... one never knows what inspired souls are &quot;lurking&quot; in our<BR>
group who seldom or never participate but may have some brilliant insights<BR>
they might one day share!<BR>
<BR>

Thanks, Raman, for replying. Too bad you missed the &quot;official tally&quot;, but<BR>
I'll make a note of it on my hard copy.<BR>
<BR>
I, too, discovered (at an early age, about 14) that I had a lactose<BR>
intolerance which, on reflection, I probably had from about age 3 or so,<BR>
thus, around the time I got weaned. <BR>
<BR>
Maybe YOU would like to do a survey of our group asking &quot;Who has dairy<BR>
product intolerance?&quot; ???<BR>
