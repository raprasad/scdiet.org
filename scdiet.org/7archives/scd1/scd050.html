Subject: Answers from Elaine to recent questions<BR><BR>

<TT>Question to Elaine:</TT>&nbsp; You recently said during your speech in Vancouver, B.C. that the diet helped
 arthritis. Is this Rheumatoid Arthritis or some other forms? (I have an aunt with
 Rheumatoid Arthritis.) <BR><BR>
<TT>Elaine's answer:</TT>&nbsp; Yes, this same diet is being used by Dr. Allan Springer (I guessed on this last name folks -
 brian) in England for RA and the most prestigious medical journals have supported this. What has she
 to lose - just 3 weeks and she'll know.

Subject: <B>OT:  arthritis, lupus, Schizophrenia, MS etc.</B><BR>

<P>&gt;Hi listees,<BR>
&gt;A little while ago someone posted that they had attended the seminar
(health fair)<BR>
&gt;in vancouver and heard Elaine Speak.<BR>
&gt;Also mentioned that Elaine stated that Lupus, schizophrenia  and Arthritis
.. can<BR>
&gt;also be treated with the SCD.. did I misread this post  .... is this true??<BR>
&gt;Perhaps many autoimmune disorders could benefit from the SCD... wouldn't
that be<BR>
&gt;wonderful!!!!<BR>

<P>
Hi Debi
(I'm not on the SCD,my husband Brad is.)  I was diagnosed with gout in my
early 20s.  That's a form of arthritis.  I also had &quot;regular&quot; arthritis
in
my feet.  I read in the book Allergies:  Disease in Disguise that allergy
can be caused by a leaky gut.  The leaky gut allows undigested/partially
digested proteins to enter the bloodstream.  The immune system becomes
sensitized to these undigested proteins (they think they're viruses) and
sets up an inflammation reaction.  The inflammation reaction can be anywhere
in the body, leading to all those &quot;-Itis&quot; conditions.  So I decided to
try
an allergy clearing diet to see if it would help.  apparently airborne
allergies decrease if you can get a handle on your food allergies.
<P>I cut out dairy from my diet (milk and cheese).  I was eating a LOT of dairy
in cheese and milk, because the nutrition powers that be say you should.  I
found my arthritis went away.  When I reintroduced dairy in controlled
experiments, within hours my feet would be hurting.  Naturally my doctors
thought this was poppycock;  yet they had no explanation.   Now if I don't
consume dairy in quantity, I don't get arthritis.   My pollen allergies
diminish along with my arthritis.
<P>in Crohn's and Colitis there'd be lots of chances for undigested proteins to
enter the bloodstream.  Brad used to complain that his &quot;brain
chemistry&quot; was
off.   He also gets a rosacea-like skin flushing when he's flaring.  So I
bet there's leaking into his bloodstream.  In a logical universe, things
have explanations.  I believe that this explanation is quite plausible.  So
yes the SCD or other diets could help those conditions.  I'm aware that a
Canadian study is set to begin on dietary controls for MS.  My public health
nurse's child has MS but is in remission due to eliminating eggs, and a few
other things.  I'll dig up the paper if you all are interested.


<P>regards, Alison

<P>
&gt; Hi,
<P>Would it be appropriate to ask Elaine if the SCD  would be benefcial to
persons with Rheumatoid Arthritis, or are you just approching her with
allowable foods?Thank you<BR>
Debra In Canada

<P>&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; A while back, we compiled questions for Elaine then I faxed them to her,<BR>
&gt; she faxed it to Michelle Porter and Michelle posted the answers.  (a<BR>
&gt; division of labor and cost saving for Elaine to fax inside Canada)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; So - Anyone have any questions?  On my list are dextrose in salt, taro<BR>
&gt; chips (I think these are a no-no because they are starchy), flax/linseed<BR>
&gt; oil (I know the fiber question has been answered but don't know about<BR>
&gt; the oil).  Anyone have questions?  Send them to me.  I want to get this<BR>
&gt; out in a few days so it will be well before Christmas.  Thanks.<BR>
&gt;<BR>

Allison,<BR>
Hi, I was emptying my mail box (filled to the MAX) and came across ypur post!
I am not an avid dairy  person hate milk BUT since reading that Elaine has said
that Rhuematoid Arthritis may be &quot;helped&quot; by following the SCD I have
deliberately included yougurt and cheese in my diet....now I am wondering ..do I
need to eliminate dairy ..or do I need to continue with the SCD to see if it
helps.....argggggg so hard to figure these bodies out!! This RA has affected my
ability to even type, hands and elbows are the most affected, it would be so
wondrous to not hurt, I call it having migraines in my joints!!!!!!<BR>
I would love to read the papers you mention.....<BR>
Hope your Christmas was great!<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Debi, In Alberta!<BR>

Subject: <B>Arthrisis Diet</B><BR><BR>
As an input to the discussion about whether SCD could have a positive effect on 
arhrisis as well as it has on colitis and crohns, I enclose an excerpt (translated) 
from a Danish health book which shows that arthrisis sufferers are recommended a diet 
very similar to the SCD.<BR>
In other words, if THIS diet helps arhrisis sufferers, then obviously, SCD would also!<BR><BR>
Sorry for the translation which is a bit rough and quickly done.<BR><BR>

<B>Arthrisis Diet</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>Excerpt from the book &quot;Det Positive K&oslash;kken&quot; (&quot;The Positive
Kitchen&quot;) by Miriam Polunin,<BR>
page 81 (published in Danish by Nyt Nordisk Forlag, Arnold Busck 1998,
K&oslash;bmagergade<BR>
49, 1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark)<BR></I>
<BR>
Diseases in joint and bones are ofte regarded as diseases of age - of wear and
tear - but in reality, they are often a result of disturbances in the chemistry
of the body where diet and life style plays an important role.<BR>
The traditional treatments with medicaments with considerable adverse effects
urge to look our for more natural methods to give relief and alleviation.<BR>
The diet is to an increasing extent regarded as playing an important role in both
prevention and relief.<BR>
<BR>
Arthrisis diets are based on two ideas.<BR>
The first is that certain kinds of arthrisis are caused and worsened by years of
unbalanced diet and stress, and that a vegetarian diet of mainly vegetables,
unraffined carbohydrates, nuts and seeds combined with control of stress can give
relief after several months on the diet.<BR>
The other is that certain kinds of rheumatoid arthritis can be a direct reaction
on special types of food which should therefore be avoided.<BR>
The diet below is partly based on the diet that is used for arthritis patients by
dr. John Hunters klinik at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England.<BR>
<BR>
Avoid the following completely in four weeks:<BR>
* Tea, coffee, chokolate, sugar, alcohol, cow milk products, meat (except
poultry), <BR>
shellfish (except newzealandic greenlipped bivalve), sardines, citrus fruits,
picled, corned or smoked food, wheat, rye, barley, soya products (including
tofu), peanuts and egg.<BR>
* Avoid all food with sugar additives.<BR>
* Cut down on salt and fat, except for app 25-50 grammes of nuts and seeds a
day, and the same amount of olive oil.<BR>
* Base you meals on vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds and combined with small
portions of more protein-rich foods.<BR>
* After four weeks:<BR>
Add one kind of food to the diet every fourth day and register the reaction in
your body.<BR>
Add the basis foods like milk, wheat, meat and eggs first. Any type of food which
gives you an unpleasant reaction should be excluded again.<BR>
<BR>
Beneficial foods:<BR>
* Fat fish has helped against rheumatoid arthrisis in scientific tests. Eat
approximately 700 grammes a week.<BR>
* Fresh ginger, 50 grammes boiled or 5 grammes raw a day. In Danish experiments
this gave relief to most patients with osteo- og rheumatoid arthrisis.<BR>
* Raw pineapple and chile has shown certain anti-infection effects.<BR>
* Newzealandic greenlipped bivalve is an unproven but popular remedy in extracted
form.<BR>
* Apples, asparges, black currant, celery and parsley has traditionally been used
to relieve arthrisis.<BR>
<BR>
Possible supplements:<BR>
The following have all caused relief from symptomes in at least one clinical
test::<BR>
* Vitamine E: take 400 mg a day<BR>
* Vitamine C: take 1 grammes four times a day, cut down after relief to 500<BR>
mg a day.<BR>
* Bromelain enzymes: take 125-400 mg three times a day.<BR>
* Pantothen acid (against rheumatoid arthritis): take 500 mg daily in two days, 1
gr<BR>
dayly in three days, 1500 mg dayly in four days and hereafter 200 mg dayly in two
months - or until pain is relieved. Cut down to the necessary minimum to
maintain relief.<BR>

<P>Uddrag fra bogen &quot;Det Positive K&oslash;kken&quot; af Miriam Polunin,
side 81 (udgivet af Nyt Nordisk Forlag, Arnold Busck 1998, K&oslash;bmagergade
49, 1150 K&oslash;benhavn K)
</I>

<P>Knogle- og ledsygdomme betragtes i vid udstr&aelig;kning som alderens
slitagesygdomme, men de er langt oftere resultater af forstyrrelser i kroppens
kemi, hvor kost og levevis spiller en v&aelig;sentlig rolle.<BR> 
Den traditionelle behandling med l&aelig;gemidler med betydelige bivirkninger
tilskynder i allerh&oslash;jeste grad til at pr&oslash;ve mere naturlige metoder
til at give lindring.<BR>
Kosten anses i stigende grad for at spille en vigtig rolle i b&aring;de
forebyggelse og lindring.<BR>

<P>Gigtdi&aelig;ter er baseret p&aring; to ideer.<BR>
Den ene er, at visse former for gigt er for&aring;rsaget og forv&aelig;rret af
&aring;rs uafbalanceret kost og stress, og at en vegetarisk di&aelig;t af
hovedsalig gr&oslash;ntsager, uraffinerede kulhydrater, n&oslash;dder og kerner
kombineret med stresskontrol kan fremkalde lindring efter adskillige
m&aring;neder.<BR>
Den anden er, at visse tilf&aelig;lde af rheumatoid arthritis kan v&aelig;re en
reaktion p&aring; specielle f&oslash;devarer, som b&oslash;r undg&aring;s.
Kostplanen herunder er delvis baseret p&aring; den di&aelig;t, som bruges ved
arthritis af dr. John Hunters klinik p&aring; Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge,
England.<BR>

<P>Undg&aring; f&oslash;lgende fuldst&aelig;ndigt i fire uger:<BR>
* Te, kaffe, chokolade, sukker, alkohol, kom&aelig;lkeprodukter, k&oslash;d
undtagen fjerkr&aelig;, skaldyr undtagen newzealandske gr&oslash;nl&aelig;bede
muslinger, sardiner, citrusfrugt, spr&aelig;ngt eller r&oslash;get mad, hvede,
rug, byg, sojaprodukter som tofu, jordn&oslash;dder og &aelig;g.<BR>
* Undg&aring; alle f&oslash;devarer tilsat sukker<BR>
* Sk&aelig;r mest muligt ned p&aring; salt og fedt, bortset fra 25-50 gram
n&oslash;dder eller kerner pr. dag og samme m&aelig;ngde olie pr. dag.<BR>
* Bas&eacute;r m&aring;ltider p&aring; gr&oslash;ntsager, frugt, n&oslash;dder,
kerner og uraffinerede kornprodukter og kerner sammen med sm&aring; portioner af
mere proteinrige f&oslash;devarer.<BR>
* Efter fire uger:<BR>
Genindf&oslash;r &eacute;n f&oslash;devare hver fjerde dag og registr&eacute;r
reaktionen. Indf&oslash;r basisf&oslash;devarer som m&aelig;lk, hvede, k&oslash;d
og &aelig;g f&oslash;rst. Enhver f&oslash;devarer, der giver u&oslash;nsket
reaktion, kan udelukkes igen.<BR>

<P>Gavnlige f&oslash;devarer:<BR>
* Fed fisk har afhjulpet rheumatoid arthrisis i fors&oslash;g. Spis cirka 700
gram om ugen.<BR>
* Frisk ingef&aelig;r, 50 gram kogt eller 5 gram r&aring; indtaget hver dag, gav
i danske fors&oslash;g en vis lindring hos de fleste med osteo- og rheumatoid
arthrisis.<BR>
* R&aring; ananas og chili har vist visse anti-bet&aelig;ndelses-virkninger<BR>
* Gr&oslash;nl&aelig;bede muslinger er et ubevist, men popul&aelig;rt middel i
ekstraktform<BR>
* &AElig;bler, asparges, solb&aelig;r, blegselleri og persille har traditionelt
v&aelig;ret brugt til gigtlindring.<BR>

<P>Mulige tilskud:<BR>
F&oslash;lgende har alle fremkaldt en vis lindring af symptomer i mindst
&eacute;t klinisk fors&oslash;g:<BR>
* Vitamin E: tag 400 mg om dagen<BR>
* Vitamin C: tag 1 gram fire gange om dagen, neds&aelig;t efter lindring til 500
mg dagligt.<BR>
* Bromelain-enzymer: tag 125-400 mg tre gange dagligt.<BR>
* Pantothensyre (mod rheumatoid arthritis): tag 500 mg dagligt i to dage, 1 gram
dagligt i tre dage, 1500 mg dagligt i fire dage, derefter 200 mg dagligt i to
m&aring;neder - eller til smerten er lindret. Sk&aelig;r s&aring; ned til det
n&oslash;dvendige minimum for at bevare lindringen.
