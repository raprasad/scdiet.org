<BR>
Dear members of the SCD list,<BR>
after being on this list for more than a year I decided to unsubscribe
because I haven't been able to benefit from the list for quite a while
now. My short story will tell you why:<BR>
I was diagnosed with colitis/crohns of the large bowel in 1992 and since
that time the inflamation, which was a minor one at the beginning,
spread to affect the rectum and sigmoid (?), tiny inflammation at the
end of the small bowel emerged as well.<BR>
I started the scd in april last year and followed it till about august
and then switched to the Lutz-diet since it turned out the scd didn't
help me (boy I loved the homemade yoghurt). The very low carbohydrate
Lutz-diet helped a bit, but it required eating a lot of animal fat and
proteins, the quality of which, in general, is very poor everywhere. I
was still taking drugs at that time, and coming closer to the end of the
year my condition deteriorated more and more. Thus I decided to go for
prednisone for the first time of my illness - up to 50 mg! It suppressed
the inflammation but I felt like a zombie and got pimples all over my
back.<BR>
In mid Feb I had had it. I had always been looking for alternatives and
finally come across raw food and - as you in America call it - Natural
Hygiene (NH). I read all I could get hold of and the theory of NH
convinced me that it was worth a trial. The idea of NH is: The cause of
all desease is toxification. Detoxification gives your body the chance
to heal. Toxification comes from cooked foods, meds, the environment
etc. The only food usable for your body is raw food. I thought that,
when it helped people cure cancer, it could help me as well.
I went on a 2 days water fast, which was pretty rough, because I had
lost a lot of weight already, and then started my raw food diet: raw
fruit and vegies. I still had some canned fish and gouts cheese in
between but found I did better without. And most importantly, I quit
taking all drugs. I lost even more weight, which I learned was natural
because of the detoxification process. It would take to long to go into
the details, so to make it short: I am in the fifth month of eating raw
food now and feel better than ever in the last 4 years. I don't take
drugs, I eat an almost 100% raw food diet and recently I resumed running
(6 km) and I notice an improved mental clarity. I don't want to conceal
that the transition to a raw food diet is not easy all the time: I tend
to overeat, which causes problems, naturally, and sometimes I miss yummy
cooked food. But I don't miss the bleeding and the violent rushes to the
toilet. These have not yet gone completely but I have them under control
more and more.<BR>
This is not a 100% success story (yet) but I know I am on the right way.
I am still not convinced that I can do without any (raw) animal protein
and fat, but I am convinced that cooked food is extremely harmful to my
body, because it can't make use of it, whereas raw food is of the best
nutritional value - without side effects, so to say. I am still
searching.<BR>
Maybe some of you find my experience interesting and inspiring. I
purposely wrote this mail today because I feel a bit down, so I thought
I won't sound too enthusiastic or even rightous or fanatical. Just one
last thing before some links you might want to try out.
At the beginning of this year I came across a drug called (here in
Germany) &quot;H15&quot;. It has helped people with inflammatory deseases
tremendously but with much fewer side effects than prednisone (or even
none, if that's possible). H15 is obtainable in Germany only under
difficult circumstances through international pharmacies because it has
not yet been approved by the national drug authorities. I have some
picture files with information about it in English which were mailed to
me by a nice guy who had collected information about this - actually
very old drug - from India called &quot;boswellia serrata&quot;, the main
constituents of which are boswellic acids. I can mail them to you, if
you are interested. And I just checked on the internet and found info
about it too (see link).<BR>

Hi everybody,<BR>
<BR>
I recently sent a post about my raw food approach of colitis, which<BR>
maybe was so long that it might have conceiled an important tip at its<BR>
end. A lot of the people on this list still use drugs of some kind and<BR>
in extreme cases this is probably necessary. That is why I want to share<BR>
this info I came across at the beginning of this year (It is no<BR>
bullshit!!).<BR>
<BR>
There is a drug the latin name of which is &quot;boswellia serrata&quot;. It is<BR>
very old and from India and it has shown remarkable results in tests<BR>
with people who have inflammatory deseases including bowel<BR>
inflammations. I got hold of newspaper articles about clinical trials<BR>
here in Germany and testimonies of people with Crohn's and Colitis that<BR>
were helped tremendously. Unfortunately they are all in German. Here<BR>
this drug is called &quot;H15&quot; and it is not freely available yet, only<BR>
through international pharmacies, whereas in America it does not seem to<BR>
be a problem. I never tried it because the discovery of this drug<BR>
coincided with my decision to embark on a raw food diet and do without<BR>
drugs.<BR>
<BR>
It is definitely worth giving this &quot;boswellia serrata&quot; some serious<BR>
consideration, because it said to have very few side effects (if any<BR>
measurable ones). Here are some links I found on the net:<BR>
