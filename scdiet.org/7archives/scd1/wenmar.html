Gut Reactions<BR>

Tiny leaks in the lining of the small intestine may play a role in diseases as diverse as asthma and arthritis<BR><BR>

   In late 1990 Michael Vonelli's life was at a standstill. The 27-year-old
shipping supervisor had been incapacitated by chronic diarrhea, abdominal
pain, constant fever and severe weight loss. He had been diagnosed with
Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammation of the small intestine and bowels,
and though he was taking multiple medications--including steroids and
antibiotics--his condition hadn't improved. He was on a leave of absence
from his job and had postponed starting a family. As a last resort, Vonelli
left his home in Bethlehem, Pa., to see a doctor--his eighth--in New York
City who had a reputation for treating the patient rather than the disease.
&quot;I was at my wits' end,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I had battled this for three years
and put everything on hold.&quot;<BR> 
   Vonelli's eighth doctor was Leo Galland, author of &quot;The Four Pillars of
Healing&quot; (330 pages. Random House. $24), who diagnosed a wide variety of
food sensitivities. He put Vonelli on a strict diet and weaned him from his
drugs. Seven years later Vonelli's life is moving again. Symptom-free, he
is back at work and taking night classes.<BR> 
   Galland told Vonelli his problem was leaky-gut syndrome, the unhappily
named condition that some researchers say is implicated in dozens of
diseases. Leaky-gut syndrome, or increased intestinal permeability, occurs
when the wall of the small intestine is damaged. A healthy intestine allows
only nutrients to pass into the bloodstream; when it is damaged, larger
molecules--such as incompletely digested fats, proteins and starches--slip
through, as well. (So do bacteria.) These substances, recognized by the
body as foreign, can trigger an immune response in other organs. Galland
and others who have written on the syndrome claim that healing a &quot;leaky
gut&quot; with strict diets and nutritional supplements can help control
insomnia, obesity and bad breath, as well as diseases from asthma to
arthritis to eczema. Many researchers agree that the intestinal tract plays
a key role in the immune system--but whether the gut is the root of so many
problems is still hotly debated.<BR><BR>
   When the gut works right, as with most organs, we don't notice it. The
small intestine is a convoluted, 25-foot tube between the stomach and the
large intestine. Its lining is made up of millions of leaflike structures
called villi, which in turn are covered with millions of microvilli. This
intestinal forest harbors bacteria and yeast, which normally maintain a
healthy balance and help carry out the intestine's main functions--breaking
down food into nutrients the body can use and moving along waste and
harmful substances to the bowel. Since most of the potentially dangerous
material a human being encounters is in food, the gut's immune function is
especially crucial, and researchers now estimate that more than two thirds
of all immune activity occurs in the gut.<BR><BR>
   But in some people the wall of the gut seems to have been
breached -- either because the network of intestinal cells develops gaps, or
bacteria and yeast overwhelm it and migrate into the bloodstream to cause
an infection. Researchers still don't know exactly why or how these
microscopic breaches occur. Among the possible causes: food allergies, too
much aspirin or ibuprofen, certain antibiotics, excessive drinking, a
compromised immune system or a parasitic infection. An overview of the
subject published in 1995 in the journal Gastroenterology found evidence of
leaky gut in diabetics, alcoholics, smokers, burn patients, iron-deficient
children, schizophrenics and long-distance runners.<BR><BR>
   Leaky-gut syndrome isn't a disease itself but is thought to play a part
in other diseases. Allowing undigested food or bacteria into the
bloodstream sets in motion a chain of events: the immune system reacts, the
body thinks it's sick and expresses it in a number of ways, such as a rash,
diarrhea, joint pain, migraines, even psychological symptoms such as
depression. Those problems can add up toa disorder that has no obvious
relation to the original cause. A three-year survey of
chronic-fatigue-syndrome patients in Nevada and California showed that the
only thing one group had in common was a history of infection with the
waterborne parasite giardia, which is suspected of causing tears in the
intestinal wall. To confuse matters more, treatments for other ailments can
cause or worsen a leaky gut. Untangling what is gut-induced and why that
happens can be tricky.<BR><BR>
   Until a few decades ago it was thought that unless a medical problem
directly affected the gut, it worked normally. But now physicians know that
trauma to other parts of the body causes the gut to react. Dr. Douglas
Wilmore, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, showed how intestinal
permeability increased in postoperative patients and people with AIDS. He
also found that the amino acid glutamine--the fuel intestinal cells use to
replace themselves every three to five days--improved the gut's function
and helped the overall health of the patient.<BR><BR>
   To a handful of true believers, leaky-gut syndrome can be the
explanation for almost anything that goes wrong in the body. &quot;When you
start looking for it, you see leaky gut in lots of people--even autistic
children and people with attention deficit disorder,&quot; asserts nutritionist
Elizabeth Lipski, author of the books &quot;Digestive Wellness&quot; (368 pages.<BR><BR>
Keats Publishing. $14.95) and &quot;Leaky Gut Syndrome&quot; (48 pages. Keats
Publishing, available December 1997). She thinks, naturally, that
traditional medicine isn't moving quickly enough to recognize the
significance of this condition. &quot;There is lots of this information in
scientific research,&quot; she says, &quot;but it isn't being used fully yet.&quot;<BR><BR>
Galland also sees a virtual epidemic of leaky guts, estimating that the
syndrome plays a role in 70 percent of people with chronic fatigue
syndrome, eight out of 10 aspirin or ibuprofen users, most alcoholics and
anyone who is hospitalized. He believes that parasites that can lead to
leaky-gut syndrome lurk in most municipal water systems, and recommends
that people &quot;treat your food and water supply as if you were in a Third
World country. Boil and filter it, or use bottled water.&quot;<BR>
   But you still have to eat something, and Galland and others contend that
even the most innocuous of foods can create intestinal havoc. One common
prescription for leaky-gut syndrome is an elimination diet. An elaborate
series of urine and blood tests is used to pinpoint food allergies. Based
on the results, whole categories of food, such as dairy products, wheat
products or fruits, are banned and then gradually added back over the
course of as much as six months while the patient is monitored for
reactions. This is what worked so well for Vonelli, though at a high price.
&quot;It took away my Italian heritage,&quot; Vonelli remembers. &quot;No more homemade
pasta, mozzarella cheese, fresh bread, everything from the good life.&quot;<BR><BR>
   That all-purpose nutritional standby, fiber, may also play a role in
healing problems of the gut. An NIH-funded study from Louisiana State
University showed that rats who ate no fiber had abnormal intestinal
linings. Glutamine, a nonessential amino acid, also plays a role in
maintaining the integrity of the intestinal wall. The research by Wilmore
was extended by his wife, physician Judy Shabert, in her book &quot;The Ultimate
Nutrient, Glutamine&quot; (224 pages. Avery Publishing Group. $9.95), co-written
with Nancy Erlich. She cites a study in which athletes who took glutamine
supplements had fewer colds than those who didn't.<BR>
   But to conclude from these studies that leaky-gut syndrome is
widespread, treatable and the cause of all sorts of problems is a leap
scientists and most physicians won't make. Peter McNally, a
gastroenterologist at Eisenhower Army Medical Center in Augusta, Ga., and a
spokesperson for the American College of Gastroenterology, says not enough
is known about a leaky gut. McNally uses celiac disease, a wheat allergy
that causes a painful skin rash and diarrhea, as an example of a proven
relationship between the intestine and disease. &quot;Finding that skin-to-gut
link,&quot; warns McNally, &quot;was not easy. It required vigorous science, and this
is an area of research that is still in its infancy.&quot;<BR><BR>
   Cathy Kapika, a professor of nutrition at the Chicago Medical School and
a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, is also skeptical.
&quot;The gut and glutamine are definitely hot areas of research right now, but
saying that a leaky gut is the cause of all of these problems is too
simplistic.&quot; As for strict elimination diets, Kapika recommends using them
only as a last-resort diagnosis of food allergies, under close medical
supervision; otherwise, they can cause serious malnutrition. But care and
maintenance of the gut, an easily abused organ, makes sense in any case. Be
alert for allergic reactions to foods that may develop after a sickness or
a round of medications. After taking antibiotics, eating yogurt that has
live acidophilus can replenish healthy intestinal flora. Cutting down on
alcohol, antibiotics and aspirin (as well as not mixing them), and
increasing one's fiber intake -- Americans typically get about a third of
what they should -- can go far in maintaining intestinal fortitude.
