Subject: <B>Bread Hazard Humour</B><BR>
<BR>
I thought this was so hilarious!  SCD'ers unite!!<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
A recent Cincinnati Enquirer headline read, &quot;Smell 
of baked 
bread may be health hazard.&quot; The article went on 
to describe 
the dangers of the smell of baking bread. The main 
danger, 
apparently, is that the organic components of this 
aroma may 
break down ozone. <BR><BR>
 
I was horrified. When are we going to do something 
about 
bread-induced global warming? Sure, we attack 
tobacco companies, 
but when is the government going to go after Big 
Bread? <BR><BR>
 
Well, I've done a little research, and what I've 
discovered 
should make anyone think twice.... <BR><BR>
 
1: More than 98 percent of convicted felons 
grew-up in house- 
holds in which bread was served daily.<BR><BR> 
 
2: Fully HALF of all children who grow up in 
bread-consuming 
households score below average on standardized 
tests. <BR><BR>
 
3: In the 18th century, when virtually all bread 
was baked 
in the home, the average life expectancy was less 
than 50 years; 
infant mortality rates were unacceptably high; 
many women died 
in childbirth; and diseases such as typhoid, 
yellow fever, and 
influenza ravaged whole nations.<BR><BR> 
 
4: More than 90 percent of violent crimes are 
committed within 
24 hours of eating bread. <BR><BR>
 
5: Bread is made from a substance called &quot;dough.&quot; 
It has been 
proven that as little as one pound of dough can be 
used to 
suffocate a mouse. The average American eats more 
bread than 
that in one month! <BR><BR>
 
6: Primitive tribal societies that have no bread 
exhibit a 
low incidence of cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's 
disease, 
and osteoporosis. <BR><BR>
 
7: Bread has been proven to be addictive. Subjects 
deprived 
of bread and given only water to eat begged for 
bread after 
as little as two days. <BR><BR>
 
8: Bread is often a &quot;gateway&quot; food item, leading 
the user to 
&quot;harder&quot; items such as butter, jelly, peanut 
butter, and even 
cold cuts. <BR><BR>
 
9: Bread has been proven to absorb water. Since 
the human body 
is more than 90 percent water, it follows that 
eating bread 
could lead to your body being taken over by this 
absorptive 
food product, turning you into a soggy, gooey 
bread-pudding 
person.<BR><BR> 
 
10: Newborn babies can choke on bread. <BR><BR>
 
11: Bread is baked at temperatures as high as 400 
degrees 
Fahrenheit! That kind of heat can kill an adult in 
less than 
one minute. <BR><BR>
 
12: Most American bread eaters are utterly unable 
to distinguish 
between significant scientific fact and 
meaningless statistical 
babbling. <BR><BR>
 
In light of these frightening statistics, we 
propose the following 
bread restrictions: <BR><BR>
 
1: No sale of bread to minors. <BR><BR>
 
2: A nationwide &quot;Just Say No To Toast&quot; campaign, 
complete 
celebrity TV spots and bumper stickers. <BR><BR>
 
3: A 300 percent federal tax on all bread to pay 
for all 
the societal ills we might associate with bread. <BR><BR>
 
4: No animal or human images, nor any primary 
colors (which 
may appeal to children) may be used to promote 
bread usage. <BR><BR>
 
5: The establishment of &quot;Bread-free&quot; zones around 
schools. <BR><BR>

Subject: <B>FOOD FIGHT!!!</B><BR>
<P>A protestant moved into a completely Catholic community. Being good
Catholics, they welcomed him to their community. But also because they
were good Catholics they did not eat red meat on Fridays. (Hey, some
traditions linger.) So, when their neighbor, receiving his paycheck on
Fridays, began barbequeing some juicy steak, they began to squirm.
<P>They were so annoyed that they went to talk to him about it. After much
talk they conviced him to become Catholic. The next Sunday he went to
the priest and the priest sprinkled holy water on him and said :<BR>
   You were born Protestant.<BR>
   You were raised Protestant.<BR>
   But now you are Catholic.<BR>
<P>The next Friday, the neighbors sat down to eat fish and were disturbed
by the smell of roast beef from the neighboring house. They went over to
talk to the new Catholic because he knew he was not supposed to eat beef
on Fridays. As they stepped through his gate, he was sprinkling ketchup
on the beef, saying :<BR>
   You were born a cow.<BR>
   You were raised a cow.<BR>
   But now you are fish.<BR><BR>
<P>Laugh a while guys - food is seldom so funny for us.<BR>
