<B>Listowner for New SCD List Needed</B><BR>
4 Jun 1997 23:28:42 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi Frequent List Posters,<BR>
<BR>
As we all know the SCD list is down. I do not know anybody that has been able to
reach Michael Cabarles.  Yesterday I tried calling Peter Clark of Filmgraphics in
Sydney. His name and number is available when you do a whois on the filmgraphics
forwarded domain name. I got a &quot;could not be connected&quot; message. I have
received no reply from the e-mail I sent to the postmaster at MAGNA.COM.AU on
5/31.<BR>
<BR>

I am able to get another SCD list set up at St. Johns University. It would be on
Listserv software, and would include many new features like searchable archives
of past posts (via web and e-mail) and files for downloading.<BR>
<BR>

I will request a list from St. Johns as soon as someone steps forward to be
primary listowner. I am willing to handle all of the technical aspects, but I
will not handle the day-to-day things like error messages, reviewing people's
first posts (we can turn off review for all the existing subscribers), and
promotion. Also it may make sense for the group's torchbearer to have an IBD, and
not celiac like I have.<BR>
<BR>

A subscriber list would have to be built from someone's mailbox of past posts.
Putting a mailbox in &quot;Who&quot; sort would find them all. Note Listserv
prefers to have the first and last name, in addition to the address. (I already
have a small list from the people that asked for the Lutz article.)<BR>
<BR>

Multiple primary owners are also possible. However, on all my other lists there
is but one primary owner, so I don't know what confusion there will be. Then
there are &quot;quiet&quot; owners, like I am, that have powers, but don't get
the notifications from the listserv.<BR>
<BR>

Now if someone can reach Michael, he'd make a great primary owner of a new list,
and would have the subscriber list, which has been estimated at 120-150
people.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

P.S. My messages to John Chalmers have not been answered.<BR>

So you go back to the Deborah Dowd days.<BR>
<BR>

&gt;  I have the last list of people in the group before  <BR>
&gt;we switched over to the listserver.  Unfortunately, I don't know how  <BR>
&gt;many of these people are still in the group, but I'm sure that some of  <BR>
&gt;them are.<BR>
<BR>

The listserv software wants first and last name. So your list is of limited
usefulness. What I'd do with it is send an announcement telling people how to
subscribe. But someone should have a mailbox with names of current subscribers.
But most important right now is a listowner.<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Also, if you give me some more details about what exactly is involved in 
<BR>
&gt;becoming the primary list owner, I might be able to do it.<BR>
<BR>

Okay. Since I have a policy of not be a primary owner of any of my lists, I have
no first hand experience. You would get lots of messages from the listserv. There
is a daily report of what mail is bouncing. What happens to errors is very
configurable, and currently they are set up so some bouncing subscribers are
automatically deleted, and some the owner has to remove. I think. (My primary
listowners really should ask among themselves, and two of them are friends.)<BR>
Then there are notices sent. These can be turned off. They will tell of who is
subscribing and unsubscribing from the list. Maybe more notices are sent. Then it
is highly recommended that every subscriber's first post to the list be reviewed.
We could start off and set the names we know to NOREVIEW. But we had better be
careful, if we subscribe someone who has since signed off, you may get a nasty
letter posted. So better to be on review and then the listowner intercepts it.
<BR>The way this works is the owner gets the post. It will have a number in the
subject. If you want to approve it (and it can be rejected for things like
excessive quoting the prior posts, a blank subject line, a subject line starting
with Re: SCD Digest..., etc.) you reply with only an OK in the message body. Or
you can send in an e-mail with multiple lines of OK xxxxx (with xxxxx the numbers
from the subject line). Then once they have successfully posted you send in a
command to set the person to NOREVIEW (can be in the same message).<BR>
<BR>

Other than ad hoc promotion by subscribers I haven't seen the list promoted. At a
minimum an announcement needs to be sent to the New List project. This is a
mailing list with 9,000 subscribers that is just announcements of new lists.
Heavily read by people in the academic community.<BR>
<BR>

Then as owner the buck would stop with you. Anything policy-wise is set by the
listowner. If someone acts up on the list the listowner has to act. People can be
put back on review. They can be set to NOPOST. Filters can be set to keep people
from subscribing. Lists are not run as democracies. A listowner has to act as
benevolent dictator. <BR>
<BR>

&gt;I assume you were trying to reach John Chalmers because he has offered  <BR>
&gt;to set up a list for us before. <BR>
<BR>

Correct. Though I was only on the SCD list for a week, I was tipped off to his
past efforts. Though no one has said why it didn't happen.
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Still no luck reaching him?
<BR>
<BR>
Right. Can someone call him? Is he on vacation?

What I wrote in my last e-mail I sent to the two owners that are friends. They
each have one list, and each has a second list pending (new lists at St. Johns
are currently on hold -- do not know for how much longer).

I'd say the only thing you missed (which I guess you wouldn't know) is that 80%
of the work is in getting it started and learning the ropes.  Once you're up and
comfortable it is quite easy indeed, it becomes second nature and really requires
no more than a few minutes a day (unless of course you join in the discussions
heavily, in which case of course that takes up as little or as much time as you
invest in writing your messages.  ;-).

I am sorry that I haven't gotten back to you sooner.

<BR><BR>
My situation is that I have been sick (not Crohn's) and am recovering.
Additionally I  am responsible for my company getting registered to QS 9000 and
our registration audit  is next week.  I am just paralyzed for time until the end
of next week.
<BR><BR>
I have a list of names that could go on the list.  I had a message from Michael 
indicatig the names are lost but I suspect we can piece it back together.
<BR><BR>
I am willing to host the group and hoped my provider could be the service.
I cannot  pursue this any more for at least a week.
<BR><BR>
This service you mention, is there a charge for it?
<BR><BR>
John

Hi,<BR>
As you probably know the SCD mailing list on filmgraphics is down. But
also we have not been able to reach Michael Cabarles. We are wondering if
all is okay with him?</P>

<P>postmaster@magna.com.au,Internet</P>

<P>If your site can't handle the SCD list anymore, I can easily get it moved 
to the Listserv at St. Johns, where I have several lists. We don't want
to pull the list away from Michael, and he is most welcome as the primary 
owner of a list at St. Johns. I handle the technical aspects of my lists.</P>


<P>To get started I need the subscriber list. Is this available?</P>

<P>You bet we've noticed!<BR>Enclosing a letter that I just sent to Don Wiss:</P>


<P>Don Wiss,donwiss @ panix . com,Internet writes:<BR>
&gt;It's been five days and all my e-mails to Michael have permanently
bounced.</P>

<P>Yes, it is really weird. Wonder what has happened ! (I hope he is not
hospitalized, or something like that).</P>

<P>&gt;Do you want to round up what names we can and start up a list? I
will not<BR>&gt;be primary owner, someone else has to be responsible for
day-to-day
things<BR>&gt;like error reports and approving people's first posts.</P>

<P>What exactly do you mean by &quot;someone else&quot;. Do you mean that
you already know someone else who would like to do it - or that we have
to find one?</P>

<P>&gt;Also I see no reason why the list can't be more aggressively<BR>
&gt;promoted (like an announcement to<BR>
&gt;the newlist mailing list).</P>

<P>True.</P>

<P>&gt;I can start by making a list of of the people that asked for the
Lutz<BR>&gt;article. Then someone else can add names from people that have
posted.</P>


<P>Well, I have a lot of names in my post box. And we have a list from the time

<P>&gt;Before asking for the list I need two things: (1) primary owner(s)
firmed<BR>&gt;up, (2) a description of the list in two to six paragraphs. I may
be able<BR>&gt;to adapt something from what was sent to me when I subscribed.</P>

<P>Description of the list is found on the web site, under &quot;What is...&quot;

(http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/scd003.html)<BR>
I am not quite sure what you mean by &quot;firmed up&quot;?</P>

<P>&gt;Being new to the list I do not know who the main players are. You
stand out<BR>&gt;because of your web site.</P>

<P>When I entered, last year in August, Deborah Dowd was the main player,
assisted by people like John Chalmer. Deborah has vanished since then (without
saying &quot;goodbye&quot;). Now Michael Cabarles is the &quot;Primary
owner&quot;,
and I still think we SHOULD give him another week to see if he comes back
on the line.</P>

<P>A random pick among the mails in my mail box, (of which I recognize the
first five of them as frequent writers to the list) are:</P>

<P>Thank you so much for your concern, Don.<BR>
Just &quot;talked&quot; to Anna who is missing the list correspondance
as much as I...</P>

<P>Okay. St. Johns is testing some new high performance Listserv software (they
have more than 400 lists), so new lists appear to be on hold. Since
I have two others pending (and a third in formation), I'll know when they
are setting them up again.
