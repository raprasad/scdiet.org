Welcome to the SCD Web Library. If you haven't been here before, allow
me to introduce the place to you.
<BR>
        This is a web site dedicated to spreading information about the <A
HREF="http://www.scdiet.org/about">&quot;Specific Carbohydrate Diet&quot;</A> 
        (SCD) and the apparently controversial fact that diet can be a way to 
        cure intestinal diseases.<BR>
(As the matter of fact, possibly also many other &quot;diseases of the
Western civilization&quot;, such as
various internal infections, arthrisis, rheumatism, astma and blood
clots.)<BR>
As appears from the letter below which I wrote a year ago to the SCD
support group on the Internet, I
started this web site because the SCD - which I learned about from a web
site in July 1996 - has saved if
not my life, then at least my intestines.<BR>
The SCD was the &quot;medicine&quot; I needed - but this no doctor in
Denmark wanted to let me know.
They had their steroid types of medicine they wanted to sell me, even
though it could never cure me. On the
contrary, the conventional medicine that doctors and hospitals have to
offer takes one into a vicious cycle
of needing more and more of it. Until you are so sick that you must have
an operation.<BR>
Living with the Specific Carbodydrate diet has not only changed my
eating habits for good. It has certainly 
also changed my view of the so-called &quot;experts&quot; and
authorities; the dieticians,  the official
advisers on diet at a national level, the doctors, the medicinal
industry, the magazines - and not to mention
the organisations that deal with intestinal disorders and imflammatory
bowel diseases. <BR>
What is happening during these years at the turn of the 20th century is
that all of a sudden the Internet
makes it possible for ordinary people like you and me to gather tons of
information, get in touch with fellow
sufferers all over the globe, learn about one another's experiences as
well as thoughts, theories and
experiments... and eventually end up with conclusions that are
controversial, ignored or directly denied by
the authorities on the field.<BR>
Internet has given us a strong alternative to the information of the
authories; in health matters just as well
as in politics.<BR>
If I had had to rely on the information that Danish doctors could give
me in 1993-1996, I would have had to
let their surgeons remove my large intestine by now.<BR>
Internet is the only reason it didn't happen - and I'll be forever
grateful that I was born late enough to
experience this fantastic invention.<BR>
Internet is a true revolution of information.<BR>
Surfing the net has tought me that while the SCD is a diet developed
specifically to cure people with
intestinal problems, there are numerous other well-documented researchs
pointing out that
low-carbohydrate diets like SCD are more than a &quot;medicine&quot; for
sick intestines; a
low-carbohydrate diet seems to be essential to health for human
beings.<BR>
This knowledge has been a well kept secret in society for too long.<BR>
I can see that Internet is going to change this.<BR>
As such, this web site is dedicated to a belief that Internet is a means
to let people have better and
healthier lives, whoever and wherever they are.
<BR><BR>
Now, sitting here at the computer with healthy intestines, this
webmaster work has given me a new health
problem: I am getting serious trouble with my right shoulder and arm
from using the computer mouse. Well,
I am not in doubt I'll find a solution for that, though it might
<I>not</I> be on the Internet!  &nbsp;

<B>Introducing myself</B><BR>
Tue, 25 August 1996 22:46:32 GMT<BR>

<BR>
Hi everyone in the group,<BR>
<BR>
I have been a quiet &quot;listener&quot; since I joined the mailing list
group three
weeks ago, - I think it is time that I present myself. My name is Mik
Aidt.<BR>
<BR>
I feel I have benefitted VERY much from reading your many letters.
First, I 
gathered them all in one long document and printed it all out, in order
to read the letters carefully and to be able to get back to them easily
later on. 
Then I thought: All this information is too valuable to disappear in
Cyberspace. 
Especially new members could benefit from it. So, as a service to
newcomers,
I began placing the correspondence of the mailing list on Internet.<BR>
<BR>
I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, I am 34 years old, work as a radio
journalist
(more about my background on 
<A
HREF="http://mikaidt.dk/1_1.html">www.mikaidt.dk</A>)
and have had ulcerative colitis (and possibly also morbus crohn's) for
about four years.<BR>
<BR>
When I first discovered blood in my stools, I went to my doctor who
looked
at me with a worried glance and said something like: &quot;This is a
chronic
disease, and it will probably only get worse. It is a mysterious
disease; we cannot
 explain it, and we have
no medicine that will cure it. We can only try to keep the infection
down.
 Eventually, most people end up needing
an operation. However, the good news is that once your intestines have
been 
removed, you'll be
cured!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thank you!<BR>
Well, she was right when she stated that it would only get worse. <BR>
I went through
months of hospital tests, and since I have travelled more than three
years
in Africa, the doctors looked for all possible sorts of microbes and
amoebas
in my intestines and stools, only to end up with an uncertain diagnosis
that I &quot;had
either ulcerative colitis or crohns&quot;. Too early to tell which of
the two, they said.<BR>
<BR>
I started taking som salazapyrin-tablets, but got some frightening
allergic
reactions from it.<BR>
Then I tried Pentasa, and some other pills, reacting allergic to all of
it.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, I moved to another city and changed to another doctor.<BR>
I found one that had studied these particular diseases.<BR>
My new doctor told me: <BR>
&quot;In your case, we are running out: There are no other types of
medicine. 
You are among the unlucky
10 percent who are allergic to all known types of medicine&quot;<BR><BR>

&quot;<I>So what do I do then?</I>&quot;<BR><BR>
&quot;Try to hold the imflammation down with prednisone suppositories.
Apart from that, I am sorry, there is no more we can do for you - except
the surgery.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;<I>How about changing my diet? What should I
eat?</I>&quot;<BR><BR>

&quot;It doesn't help. Eat as you like and what you feel is good for
you. 
It is scientifically proven in many research studies that whatever food
you eat
 has no effect whatsoever on this disease.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This was the kind of statement I had heard from every doctor I had
asked.
&quot;Food has no relevance&quot;. When I was at hospital, my request to
talking to a dietician was refused. (Not to mention the food they served
at that hospital: absolutely awful!
Scandalous!)<BR>
The best advice they can give people with intestianl problems at the hospitals is
that they should eat spaghetti, wheat porage, mashed potatoes and brown rice (which is 
approximately the <I>worst</I> advice they could give, according to the SCD theory). <BR>
<BR>
I also told one of these hospital doctors that I had noticed a change in
my drive for sex; 
it worried me that it had somehow
disappeared! &quot;Is that because of the medicine or could it simply be
because of the imflammation in the
intestines?&quot;, I asked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No way! Neither has any effect on that!&quot;, was the confident
answer, not to be questioned any
further.
<BR>
<BR>
So, I started looking into alternative medicine. <BR>
A herbalist (homeopath) told me that I should stay away from
carbohydrates and then gave me some papers
from an Austrian doctor, <A HREF="scdlutz.html">Wolfgang Lutz</A> 
who claimed to have saved hundreds of patients with
a low-carbohydrate diet. The papers told about this doctor's personal
experiences,
but nothing about WHY such a low-carbohydrate diet would have such a
positive
effect.<BR>
<BR>
Then, I more or less made up my own diet, and in the beginning, it had a
great
effect. After a while, though, things started sliding downwards again. 
Blood, diarrea, bloatedness,
farting. During early 1996, it developed to a point where I couldn't
make a normal
living without the daily Prednisone suppository. This put a damper on
the
flare, but as time went on, even this medicine seemed to have less and
less
effect. The bleeding just wouldn't stop anymore.<BR>
<BR>

I spent my summer holiday 1996 at a place where there is access to
Internet.
I started looking for web pages on &quot;imflammatory bowel
diseases&quot;, and found so much material
out there in Cyberspace that I was almost
losing my breath. <BR>
The discovery of a home page about Elaine Gottschall's book <A
HREF="http://fwi.com/cmg">
&quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot;</A> and
her &quot;Specific Carbohydrate Diet&quot; was
like a revelation to me - it made me SO happy to learn that apparently
there
seemed to BE a way out - and an <I>explanation</I> to this hell of a
disease.<BR> 
For the first time, here was a message of <I>hope</I>!.<BR>
Elaine Gottschall's book
was a well kept secret in Denmark - not even the Danish Colitis/Crohn's
Association
had ever heard about it.<BR>
<BR>
Through the webmaster of the page on Elaine Gottschall's book, I heard
about Deborah Dowd whom I
contacted and who sent me some
encouraging testimonial files and more material - as well as telling me
about the support group and the SCD mailing list (which at that time did
not have a list server). Again, I was
absolutely overwhelmed with the amount of
sensible information and the warm and helpful tone that exists in this
group.<BR>
<BR>
I ordered the book instantly. For two weeks, I impatiently waited for it
to arrive, while my diarrhea got worse and worse, thin like water, full
of blood.<BR>
<BR>
Reason: I ran out of Prednisone medicine on July 20, 1996, and didn't
feel like
calling my doctor to order more. Having been on the stuff for three
months
non-stop and still bleeding, and knowing about its cancer growth side
effects,
I decided to put it to a halt.<BR>
<BR>
Result: A period with liters of blood spraying out of me, diarrhoea like
water, running to the toilet at least
every
second or third hour, all day and all night, and as a new unpleasent
development:
fever every night, combined with strong, unpleasant and constant stomach
pain.
And at one point, (that was a bit later, though), the imflammation even
spread 
to my right eye, making me half blind.<BR><BR><BR>
<BR>
After about a week on Elaine's diet, the stomach pain disappeared. Then
I
started getting extremely weak and tired, hardly being able to walk up
the
steps to the third floor where I live. People who have travelled in
Africa or Asia will remember how 
it feels when you have had a strong diarrhoea for a while. <BR>
<BR>
After having been on the diet for 14 days, I noticed something
that I took as a first sign of improvement: For the first time in months
I hadn't been to the
toilet at all that day - 17 hours ago I was there last! And the weakness
was
gone.<BR>
<BR>
Something to celebrate, in my little world! So, today I felt it was time
to join in.<BR>
<BR>
It has been a scary period, that is also why I have kept
&quot;silent&quot;
here in the group - I wanted to wait and see how things would turn out.
At several points I have felt very close to calling an ambulance and
giving 
in to hospital treatment. Today, I can sense improvement and have a
strong
feeling I am going to <I>make</I> this.<BR>
<BR>
If this really works for me, I will have completely lost my confidence
in
the Danish health system. What pisses me off the most, is the stubborn
statements of the doctors I have
met about
that &quot;food makes no difference. Eat what you like...&quot; - same
thing
mentioned in the magazine of the Danish Colitis/Crohns Association. A
magazine which, by the way, happens
to be sponsored by a medicine company. <BR>
And whose answer to me - when I told them about what I had learned on
the Internet - was that &quot;they
did not need any Internet, because they were fully confident in relying
on the educated and skilled doctors of
theirs.&quot;<BR>
Honestly, it appears
to me as if somebody somewhere in this system is only after selling more
of the expensive medicines and
keeping the hospital surgeons employed.<BR>
<BR>
Well, didn't want to bother you with my whole life story! The main
message
from here is that I feel grateful for the valuable information and the
support
 from receiving the letters in this online SCD group.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you so much, all of you,<BR>
<BR>
Yours,<BR>
Mik <p></P>
<BR><BR>
PS: And then I just heard on the news the other day: &quot;A scientic
research has <I>now</I> proved that
Prednisone and similar hormone medicine affects people's sex life
dramatically. It simply kills
it.&quot;<BR>
Well, thank you, doctor, for your arrogant confidence in your self when
you insisted on the opposite!

<P><B>Post Scriptum:</B> <BR>
January 1998<BR><BR>

The letter above was written and sent to the SCD mailing list 
on August 25th 1996. Two months later, my 
bleeding and diarrhea had disappeared completely. <BR>
A miracle? It certainly felt that way!<BR>
As Christmas came closer and my health was back to normal (for the first
time in years), 
I got into a hectic period with loads of work - got the flu, then
influenza... and on 
December 20th, the blood and the diarrhea returned. <BR>
This made me realize that this diet alone wouldn't make it for me if I
didn't add some 
common sense to it:  As a New Year resolution, I made some changes to my
life style 
in order to improve the general status of my immune system: <BR>
<LI>I made sure to get a full eight-hour nights sleep - <I>every
night</I> and with a 
bedtime <I>before</I> midnight
<LI>I put an effort into getting some real exercise at least twice a
week, 
<LI>attended a yoga course, and 
<LI>generally tried hard not to overload myself with stress and
work...<BR>
This - combined with the diet - seemed to be the right track for me:
After approximately 
one month of remission, I was back to normal stools, visiting the
toilets only once a day. 
It was a great feeling! - and this time around I was aware that it was
still a fragile situation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have learned now that ulcerative colitis is much more difficult to get
rid of than morbus crohn's, and
therefore,
as the matter of fact, I should be prepared that there'll be relapses.
So far, I have only had that one.<BR>
 As I am writing this, January 1998, I feel as healthy as if I had
never heard about this (so-called
  &quot;chronic&quot;) disease. No symptoms at all since February-March
1997. Waao!<B> &nbsp; :-D </B> &nbsp;
<BR>
I feel very privilleged that I learned about the SCD diet in time. And I
feel so sorry for all those who didn't,
and who'll have to live with a plastic bag on their stomach for the rest
of their lives.<BR><BR>

In about two years time, when I know <I>for sure</I> that this diet
really has cured me, 
(which it presently appears to have!) I am going to make
some noise in the Danish press concerning what appears to me like a true
scandal:  
how an ignorant hospital
system and profit seeking medicinal companies are making tens of  
thousands of people suffer and loose their intestines.<BR><BR>

The business of drug therapy, surgery, ostomy bags, etc., world wide has
been calculated to 
more than three and a half billion US dollars a year...<BR>
In Danish: Vi taler om en oms&aelig;tning p&aring; 20 milliarder kroner
om &aring;ret her!<BR>
(Ref: <A HREF="http://iol.ie/%7ealank/CROHNS/cost.htm">The financial cost
of Crohn's 
disease</A>)<BR><BR>

And please note: I don't say <I>all</I> doctors are ignorant - because
obviously, 
I know there are qualified and serious doctors who make valuable,
scientific efforts 
to solve the mysteries of this unknown illness. <BR>
What I say about doctors on this web site only refers to 
the particular ones I have met face to face, in the hospitals in
Denmark.
<BR><BR>
PPS: Did I forget to mention: what a beautiful feeling it is to have
that almost forgotten desire for making
love come back to you after three years of absence. Thought it had left
me for good. Never trust a doctor
when he tells you with his &quot;I-know-better-attitude&quot; that sex
drive and hormonal medicine - or
sex drive and intestinal diseases - have nothing to do with each other.

<P><B>Post Scriptum:</B> <BR>
April 1999<BR><BR>

Being completely &quot;healed&quot;, I gradually got less and less strict with the diet. 
Coffee and alcohol, for instance, quickly found its way back into the dailyday.
Having been completely healthy for one and a half year, in a stressed period, 
the disease showed its ugly face again, sneaking in little by little. 
Signs of blood and diarrhea returned, and seemed to linger on and on.<BR>
Waited more than half a year until I decided to go back to the strict version of the diet, 
and even made 
it much stricter: only fish, green groceries and water for a whole month. Nothing else. 
No milk products, no fruits, no honey. 
Lots of A- and E-vitamines, zink, fish oil and other supplements. 
The campaign worked: within a month I was back to health again. Have been feeling great ever since. 
And not to mention: still haven't touched <B>any</B> kind of medicine since August 1996.

(a)

I<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;So I just wanted to hear how YOU do it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;		Sincerely, <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;		Dietmar<BR></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Hi Dietmar,<BR>
<BR>
Uh! It is a long story...<BR>
Well. For breakfast, I have eaten the same thing every morning for over
a year now. I am very happy
about this new routine in my life, and I make sure NEVER to miss my
breakfast
anymore. (Used to start the day flying off to work, grab a sweet
&quot;Danish
Pastry&quot; on the way on the bicycle, etc...)<BR>
Simply: Half a liter of home made (24 hour fermented) yoghurt, with
raisins, a bit of coconut
flour, some almond flour and a bit of crushed almonds.<BR>
That is a great solid way to get the engine running right from the
morning.
<BR>
Then I take some vitamin pills, fish oil, apple cider vinegar, iron
supplement.
Flush it down with some home made &quot;kombucha tea&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
To be more exact: <BR>
Every <B>morning</B>, right after eating 0,5 liter home made (24 hour
fermented) yoghurt, I take:<BR>
<LI>1 multi-complex vitamin pill (including minerals)</LI>
<LI>1 vitamin C  pill (1500 mgr)</LI>
<LI>1 Q-10 pill</LI>
<LI>3 cl Apple  Cider Vinegar</LI>
<LI>3 cl &quot;Kra&uuml;terblut&quot; (liquid Iron supplement)</LI>
<LI>3 cl Fish Oil (sometimes liquid, sometimes pills, with A- and
D-vitamins removed)</LI>
<LI>30-40 gram of fresh, organic ginger,  cut in slices, put in a thermo
which 
is then filled with app. one liter of boiling water. Ready to drink
after approximately one hour but better to
wait for several hours, since it gets stronger and stronger as the hours
go by. 
<BR>
<BR>
Two-three hours later, I am usually out somewhere in town or at work and
it is around <B>11 o'clock
AM</B>.<BR>
I can only very seldom eat what they serve in the canteen at my work
place,
(full of sauces with heavy cream, or mixed with cheese, etc) so I bring
my own
little plastic jar with home made food.<BR>
<LI>Sometimes fresh shrimps mixed with olive oil, salt, spices, almond
flour,
green or black olives, Iceberg Salad and small cubes of Emmentaler
cheese.<BR>
Sometimes an omelet made of three eggs, with some roasted coconut flour
and some fresh tomatoes or green salad.<BR></LI>
<LI>Sometimes fried turkey meat, again chopped in small pieces and mixed
with olive oil, salt, spices and
almond flour.<BR></LI>
<LI>My favorite meat dish: I take the &quot;ruffage&quot; which is left
over after having
made home made carrot juice (don't know it is called). Then I mix it
half and half with minced turkey meat, add some spices, garlic and salt,
and
fry it on a pan.<BR>
Tastes juicy and great. <BR></LI>
<BR>
Then at around <B>2 or 3 PM</B>, I am hungry again. I grap for my bag
where I always
have <BR>
<LI>a bottle with either half a liter of home made carrot juice or half
a liter of organic grape juice.<BR>
Small supplements to nip from: <BR>
<LI>Olives from a jar, maybe an apple, etc.</LI><BR>
During the afternoon, I empty the thermo can of 
<LI>ginger tea that I've prepared in the morning.</LI><BR>
This kind of &quot;tea&quot; can keep you going if your stomach
is empty and there's no &quot;safe&quot; food around, and on top of it
all: it is bloody healthy - just like
garlic, for instance.<BR>
<BR>
At around <B>5 PM</B>, my &quot;first dinner&quot;: Very varied.
Different ideas every night. Usually
something which is quick to prepare, with meat and salad.
<BR>
<BR>
At <B>8 PM</B>, I am ready for a &quot;second dinner&quot;  which is the
main course: This time around,
I spend more time to prepare the dinner, might even look at some of the
recipes in Elaine Gottschall's book
or from the Internet. Generally: 
<LI>Lots of chicken, turkey, fish. (Only once in a while &quot;red
meat&quot;)<BR></LI>
<LI>Salads made of cucumber, green peper, mushrooms, lettuce,
tomatoes... etc.<BR></LI>
<LI>Dressing made of olive oil, home made yoghurt, mustard and a bit of
honey, etc...</LI><BR><BR>

<LI>Dessert: Creamy yoghurt with strawberries and honey. Or simply some
yoghurt with honey and
crushed 
nuts (which have been browned on the frying pan  - in no oil). <BR>
Or yoghurt &quot;ice cream&quot;... (See Gottschall's book).<BR>
Or some home browned cashew nuts. Or simply almonds with raisins.<BR>
<BR>
Usually, I drink a glass of red wine app. every second day.<BR>
<BR>
I'll stop here, before this gets too long. This will have to be the
short version.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yours,<BR>
Mik<BR>
