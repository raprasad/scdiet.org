Subject: Fish oil<BR>
From: BERNINGER JOSEPH LLOYD,berninge@ucsub.Colorado.EDU,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Hello everybody,<BR>
<BR>
Hope all are well. I've just returned from a trip back home helping out<BR>
with my father. I'm still on the diet; however, I have fallen off the<BR>
wagon several times...a humbling and frustrating lesson. Like many of<BR>
you, I have been in a flare for about a month. I have been on the diet<BR>
since mid-April, so I guess the timing is right for a flare, eh?<BR>
<BR>
I have some news about fish oil capsules for those of you interesting. I<BR>
have two sources for the exact same capsule; therefore, I will not repeat<BR>
the ingredients twice.<BR>
<BR>
Here is the description of the capsule:<BR>
<BR>
EPA-DHA COMPLEX - Marine lipids from cold water fish oils, cholesterol<BR>
free<BR>
<BR>
Each Capsule contains:<BR>
<BR>
Natural Marine Lipd concentrate 1000 mg<BR>
EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) 180 mg<BR>
DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) 120 mg<BR>
Vitamin E (d-Alpha tocopherol) 1 IU<BR>
<BR>
Recommendations: 3 capsules daily<BR>
<BR>
These nutrients are without any no-no's from our diet - so they are safe.<BR>
<BR>
One company is called Metagenics (very reputable, excellent quality and<BR>
customer service.) However, I believe you can only order them from a<BR>
distributor. I get mine through my family, because they are all<BR>
chiropractors and have an account. You can call the 800 number, they have<BR>
distributors all over the country and internationally as well. The phone<BR>
number is 1-800-522-6382.<BR>
<BR>
The other contact is for those of you who live in California and Arizona.<BR>
The company is called Trader Joe's and they have quite a wonderful and<BR>
extensive line of nutrients called Trader Darwin's (for the Surivial of<BR>
the Fittest). Cute, but effective. Their same formula as Metagenics is<BR>
called Omega-3 EPA. It's a bit cheaper than Metagenics but they won't<BR>
ship to any location, so only the locals can purchase this at the store.<BR>
Not to worry, between these two sources, everyone from all locations<BR>
should be able to attain fish oil if so desired.<BR>
<BR>
Please let me know if you have any questions or need more info.<BR>
<BR>
Peace, love, and healing,<BR>

Subject: Hello, UC question.<BR>
From: Matt and Meg,mheffron@gtii.com,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Hello all!<BR>
First and foremost, a big thanks to Deborah for maintaining this list, and<BR>
also to those of you in the group that have responded to questions we have<BR>
posted elsewhere. It is such a relief and a comfort knowing that there's<BR>
&quot;someone&quot; that we can talk to!<BR>
<BR>
Brief background: We are Matt Heffron and Meg Franklin, a couple of<BR>
&quot;late-twenty-somethings&quot; located in Traverse City, Michigan. Meg
was<BR>
diagnosed with UC three years ago, after her family doctor completely<BR>
misdiagnosed her symptoms and &quot;ignored&quot; the problems for a couple
months.<BR>
This landed Meg in the hospital for a fair amount of time... Anyway, things<BR>
had been going quite well for her for the last two years, but she started<BR>
suffering more and more frequent flares early this summer. The medication<BR>
hasn't done much to bring things around this time, so we're looking for<BR>
alternative / supplimental treatments. I happened to stumble across some<BR>
information on Elaine's book while searching the web for UC inforamtion,
and<BR>
it led me (albeit in a round-about fashion) to this group.<BR>
<BR>
Our question is this; I have read many of the testimonials and am amazed<BR>
and encouraged by the results that those of you suffering with Crohns have<BR>
reported. What seems to be in short supply, (at least from what I've seen
so<BR>
far) is any information on the effectiveness of the diet in dealing with
UC.<BR>
If any of you UC-folk &quot;out there&quot; are having success or problems
with the<BR>
diet, we would certainly like to hear from you. Meg's condition has improved<BR>
a bit over the last few days, and if it continues to do so, she's<BR>
considering starting in on the diet. While I'm fairly convinced she should<BR>
just go for it, I'm having a devil of a time convincing her to give up<BR>
several of her favorite foods to try &quot;...some crazy diet...&quot; &lt;g&gt;.
Any info<BR>
at all about UC and the diet would be most appreciated...<BR>
<BR>
Good health!<BR>
Matt &amp; Meg<BR>

Subject: UC question, acupuncture<BR>
From: Roger Rettig,76544.2050@CompuServe.COM,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Hello All,<BR>
<BR>
Matt &amp; Meg - I have UC and would definitely recommend the diet. I have
been on<BR>
the diet since Jan 96 and I noticed a positive difference in the first week
of<BR>
the diet. I showed slow but steady improvement for months, fewer bm's, less<BR>
urgency, more energy. I am nowhere near where I want to be but I was desperate<BR>
enough to try anything when I started it. I was on medication for 4 months
with<BR>
little improvement when I found the diet, almost didn't start it because
I<BR>
didn't think I could give up most of my favorite foods for 2 years. I'll
admit<BR>
it not an easy diet to follow, but for me the results outweigh all the extra<BR>
work. Things have flared up for me the past week, most I believe is due
to my<BR>
sister being very ill and some added stress at work. You can always try
it for<BR>
a month, you should show some improvement if it will work for you.<BR>
<BR>
Michael - I am behind on answering my e-mail but you had asked how the bread<BR>
made from the recipe in the book holds up in a sandwich. Well, I take it
to<BR>
work almost everyday and I enjoy it. I cut it in ?&quot; slices, every once
in a<BR>
while it will crumble a bit, but it works well for me. <BR>
<BR>
I don't remember who mentioned the other day that they have had acupuncture<BR>
treatments but I have some questions. After thinking about it for a few
months,<BR>
I decided to take the plunge and make an appointment. That night I read
the<BR>
e-mail but I deleted the message. The doctor said that he has had positive<BR>
results with UC patients so I'm going to give it a try. My questions are:
How<BR>
many treatment did you have before you saw results? Were you on a special
diet<BR>
when you were in remission? How often should you go to maintain things?<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
<BR>

Hi Matt and Meg,<BR>
<BR>
Please investigate Mr. Daniel Drucker' work on a new protein ( GLP-2 )<BR>
from the University of Toronto. <BR>
<BR>
I posted it before to the group but nobody showed interest. Perhaps you
would<BR>
like to know about it.<BR>

Welcome and good luck<BR>

<BR>
Benito,<BR>
<BR>
I must refute your posting that nobody showed interest in GLP 2, which Drucker<BR>
has received publicity for. I am so gratified by this breakthrough and some<BR>
others that I have found on websites, such as some preliminary indications
of<BR>
isolation of an offending microorganism. I'm sure we are so close to a<BR>
breakthrough here, I really must believe that. And to think that the wall
of<BR>
the intestine may soon be repaired by medication, namely GLP 2. Unfortunately<BR>
these things take time and may not come through at all, so I faithfully
plod<BR>
away with the diet in the meantime. But a little hope on the horizon goes
a<BR>
long way, no doubt about it.<BR>
<BR>
Anne,<BR>
<BR>
I have had IBS for 20 years and have had many experiences in not being able
to<BR>
tolerate foods, having them go through me viciously. That doesn't happen
to me<BR>
anymore and I hope you can reach a new level of tolerance. I don't know
how<BR>
many things you have tried. Yogurt helps some people be able to digest better,<BR>
of course homemade only. I only use 18% table cream and 36 hours incubation.<BR>
Then a few more hours after that in the fridge, even overnight, then faithfully<BR>
pour off the small amount of whey which accumulates. I do more than just
soak<BR>
my lentils, I rinse them thoroughly right in the beginning, it's amazing
how<BR>
much starch comes off, especially before they are soaked. I think the orangey<BR>
lentils are the best, really flavorful. I think the rinsing is more valuable<BR>
than the soaking. I have seen improvement with the addition of some supplements<BR>
like Cat's Claw and garlic. I am now experimenting with fermented foods
and<BR>
it's going well. I have been eating sauerkraut. ( I don't know if it is
legal<BR>
or not so don't try it yet!) There was a time when that would have been<BR>
deadly, I can practically feel the cramps just thinking about it. Now it
does<BR>
give me diarrhea, but no cramps or pain involved at all and seems to me
to be a<BR>
good diarrhea, a kind of cleansing. I am searching for other legal fermented<BR>
foods, I use apple cider vinegar always instead of white. These fermented<BR>
foods, yogurt included, are supposed to deliver a dose of good microoganisms
to<BR>
the digestive tract. Don't stop pursuing this thing, you can make progress
with<BR>
persistance. I recently successfully put honey back in my diet and am fine
with<BR>
nuts now as well. I hope some of this will be of help. I have had a hard
time<BR>
getting on and staying on the diet but have seen good progress, just slower
than<BR>
others who are more faithful, and I believe now, that when I eat something
I<BR>
shouldn't it takes my digestive system a full five days to recover. Therefore<BR>
if I am slipping up on the weekends, it does hamper any sign of improvement.<BR>
(Slipping up can be as simple as a small helping of a pasta dish just to
keep a<BR>
hostess happy.) Five days payment for that! Especially as I get better,
this<BR>
effect becomes more pronounced. Don't think I don't still struggle, this
is a<BR>
constant battle for me. I am much healthier than I have been in 20 years,
but<BR>
not as healthy as I intend to be. Talk about slow progress!!!! <BR>
<BR>
Russ,<BR>
<BR>
Was it you who posted the technique for yogurt cheese. I gave it a try and
it<BR>
works great, thanks for the tip. Also was it you too who posted a message
from<BR>
&quot;Sue&quot; who is about to give up on the diet. Perhaps the above message
could be<BR>
sent to her to give her a few more options before she cans it. I deleted
her<BR>
address by accident so you would have to send it along if you wanted to.<BR>
<BR>
Meg and Matt,<BR>
<BR>
UC appears to be the more difficult of disorders to deal with and seems
to take<BR>
longer. However I have not seen anybody who has any better answer than this.<BR>
While the dietary changes are challenging, I have found some foods that
I really<BR>
like and I am now prepared to do this long term or until GLP-2 rescues me.
The<BR>
longer I am on this diet the less I crave carbohydrates. Good luck as you<BR>
consider your options.<BR>

I have not been on a disciplined regimine of taking fish oil, however, I<BR>
do plan to start one in August. My brother ( the chiropractor) who<BR>
specializes in nutrition/supplementation highly recommends fish oil, as<BR>
others in alternative healing that you've read.<BR>
<BR>
I have been on a program of various supplementations. Including some<BR>
specifically recommended for people with IBD. One formula is called<BR>
Permeability factors, for leaky gut. It contains a high dosage of<BR>
L-glutamine, N-Acetyl-D Glucosamine, Gamma-Linolenic Acid, Gamma-Orzanol,<BR>
Vitamin E, andPhosphatidyl Choline. These are safe for the diet.<BR>
<BR>
I also take a special formula(an herbal complex along with pancreatic<BR>
enzymes) that are for people challenged with IBd It contains many herbs<BR>
that have been consistently recommended for IBD in all of my research..
I<BR>
can't take too much credit - my loving brother has done alot of research<BR>
for me and has come up with these formulations through his contacts.<BR>
<BR>
I'd be happy to answer any questions, if I can help. I do feel that these<BR>
formulas help. It is difficult for me to be convinced that any thing is<BR>
helping when I am in a flare (as I am now). Yet, discouragement is all<BR>
part of the game and it shouldn't interfere with obvious progress.<BR>
<BR>
I am still perplexed about the iron supplements. I do not take them even<BR>
though I haven't eaten red meat in sixteen years. If anyone has any<BR>
input, I'm happy to hear from you. I'm only 31 years old, so I quit<BR>
eating meat as an early teenager, does anyone else have similar<BR>
experience?<BR>
<BR>
Hope all of you are well.<BR>

Hello Matt &amp; Meg,<BR>
<BR>
Its nice to have a couple more locals in our group. I envy you two living
up <BR>
in Traverse City... such a beautiful place. I live in Wyandotte, just <BR>
outside of Detroit. But Traverse City was always a favorite vacation spot
of <BR>
our family. I'm 42, have had crohn's for about 16 years. We live in a big
<BR>
old house built back in 1924. With 5 kids we needed the room. Although,
now <BR>
we only have 3 of the kids left at home. <BR>
<BR>
I'm not real keen on the diet. It didn't work for me. But everyone here
<BR>
realizes that the diet is not for everyone. Its still a great group for
<BR>
support and understanding. And I always hear about new medical treatments
<BR>
and breakthroughs from the people in our group. So it keeps me current on
a <BR>
wide range of treatments.<BR>
<BR>
Welcome and enjoy!<BR>

Thanks for the reply about the bread, when I get over this flareup , I'll<BR>
give it a try. As for accupuncture, I've just had one treatment by Dr Lu's<BR>
measles scaping method, which is a non invasive form of traditional chinese<BR>
medicine. It is based on the same pressure points as accupunture but<BR>
produces faster results. the areas are rubbed (with a coin in china -<BR>
ouch!) but Dr Lu has produced a smooth hard, ivory-like tool. If you don't<BR>
like needles , you may want to try this.<BR>

Carbohydrates<BR>
<BR>
Well, at long last, here's the sports nutrition primer that I've been<BR>
promising for four months. I had originally planned to start with protein<BR>
but cannot find some of the references that I need. So, first I'l like to<BR>
talk a little about carbohydrates: what they are, how they are digested,<BR>
what they do in the body, athlete's requirements, etc.<BR>
<BR>
What they are<BR>
<BR>
As the name suggests, carbohydrates are carbon chains with hydrogen and<BR>
hydroxyl (OH) groups attached. They tend to occur in 6 carbon chains which<BR>
have a tendency to form into rings. Single chain carbs are called<BR>
monosaccharides or simple sugars. This includes glucose (blood sugar),<BR>
fructose (fruit sugar) and galactose.<BR>
<BR>
When monosaccharides join, they form disaccharides. Examples are sucrose<BR>
(which is a glucose joined to a fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose),<BR>
and maltose (glucose + glucose).<BR>
<BR>
Multiple unit chains of monosaccharides form polysaccharides or starches,<BR>
also referred to as complex carbohydrates.<BR>
<BR>
How it is digested<BR>
<BR>
Digestion of carbs start in the mouth during chewing due to the action of<BR>
ptalin or salivary amylase where polysaccharides (chains of multiple<BR>
monosaccharides) are broken down. In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase<BR>
continues the breakdown of starches. Then specialized enzymes (maltase<BR>
breaks down maltose, lactase breakse down lactose, etc) continue the<BR>
breakdown into monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose).<BR>
<BR>
FYI, you may have heard of a condition called lactose intolerance. This<BR>
disease afflicts many people and is the inability to digest lactose. It
is<BR>
cause by a decrease in the enzyme lactase and can be treated with lactase<BR>
supplements (Lact-Aid and Dairy Ease are two) which are taken with dairy<BR>
products. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include gas, diarrhea, and<BR>
indigestion when dairy foods are eaten. Some people find yogurt easier to<BR>
digest than milk or cheese presumably due to the presence of active yogurt<BR>
cultures which aid in digestion.<BR>
<BR>
The fate of broken down sugars varies. Glucose and galactose are generally<BR>
stored as glycogen (strings of glucose) in the blood and muscle. Fructose
is<BR>
further digested in the liver and can be converted into glucose, lactic<BR>
acid, or triglyceride (a type of fat). If large amounts of glucose reach
the<BR>
bloodstream, some may be stored as fat. However, conversion of carbo to
fat<BR>
is only about 70% efficient meaning that, of 100 extra calories taken in
as<BR>
carbs, only about 70 will actually be stored with the other thirty being<BR>
used up to fuel the conversion process. Another factor which may affect<BR>
carbs being stored as fat is the glycemic index (which I'll cover in a<BR>
little bit). When carbs are eaten, insulin is released, the amount of<BR>
insuling depending on a number of factors. Insulin moves carbs (and amino<BR>
acids) into muscle cells and also into fat cells. Some have suggested that<BR>
it is extremely high insulin levels which promote fat storage but I'm<BR>
getting ahead of myself.<BR>
<BR>
Next time, I will talk about carbohydrates uses in the body and get into
how<BR>
much athlete's need along with the various sources and timing of<BR>
carboyhydrate ingestion.<BR>

<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
This time I want to talk about the uses of carbohydrate in the body.<BR>
<BR>
Carbohydrate's main use in the body is for energy needs. Whether it is to<BR>
fuel immediate energy requirements (during exercise) or to be stored for<BR>
future use (as glycogen in the muscle) it's main purpose is to provide<BR>
energy. However, it pales in comparison to fat as an storage depot for<BR>
energy. A sedentary person can store about 1700 calories as glycogen (with<BR>
400 of that in the liver) while fat stores may total up to 35000 (more than<BR>
10 marathon's worth) calories (assuming 10lbs of fat). An athlete may be<BR>
able to store as many as 4000 calories as carbohydrate due to training<BR>
adaptations, but this is still limited compared to the 10000-30000 calories<BR>
stored as fat. In any case, glycogen is limited and ,if carbohydrate is
not<BR>
supplied regularly, stores become rapidly depleted. Ideally, during<BR>
exercise, only fat would be used as it is essentially limitless.<BR>
Unfortunately, this is not chemically possible as some carbohydrate must
be<BR>
available for fat to be oxidized.<BR>
<BR>
Another use of carbohydrate (and one which is related to energy needs) is
to<BR>
spare protein. When I talk about protein and nitrogen balance, this will<BR>
make a little more sense. For now, let me say that inadequate carbohydrate<BR>
intake will raise protein requirements.<BR>
<BR>
Another form of carbohydrate (which I didn't mention in part 1) is fiber.<BR>
There are two types of fiber (soluble and insoluble). Fiber serves many<BR>
purposes in the body including softening the stool and decreasing blood<BR>
cholesterol levels (I'll go into more detail in the section on fats).<BR>
Another function of fiber is to slow gastric emptying and digestion. This<BR>
serves to slow the release of carbohydrate into the bloodstream and helps
to<BR>
keep insulin levels steadier. Recommendations are 25-30 grams per day.<BR>
Average intake is around 10-15 grams per day.<BR>
<BR>
Ok, well what about carbohydrate recommendations for athletes and other<BR>
folks. With all the recent fervor over heart disease, the trend has been
to<BR>
increase carbohydrate intake in this country in lieu of fat. General<BR>
recommendations are for 65-75% of total calories to come from carbohydrates<BR>
with no more than 10% in the form of simple sugars. Actual American intake<BR>
hovers around 45% of total calories. There is no RDA for carbohydrates.<BR>
<BR>
Next time, I will get into more specific details regarding carbohydrates
for<BR>
athletes including when to take in carbs relative to training and also what<BR>
kind of carbs.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Well, before I talk about specifics about carb intake, let me talk a little<BR>
about insulin. Insulin is a hormone which is released from the pancreas<BR>
after carbohydrate is digested. Insulin has a couple of functions. One is
to<BR>
drive glucose into the muscle cells by increasing glucose transport. Another<BR>
is to drive glucose and fat into fat cells by stimulating an enzyme called<BR>
lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Thus, insulin is a double edged sword when it<BR>
comes to athletic performance. Without it, glucose cannot reach the muscle<BR>
cells where it is needed, but an excess will contribute to fat storage.<BR>
<BR>
Well, depending on certain factors (which I'll cover in the next post),
you<BR>
may or may not want a high insulin level. The amount of insulin released
is<BR>
basically a factor of how quickly glucose is released into the bloodstream.<BR>
Rapid release will result in a large insulin response. Sometimes, too much<BR>
insulin is released leading to low blood sugar as too much of the ingested<BR>
carbohydrate is shunted into the muscle/fat cells which results in hunger<BR>
and impaired performance.<BR>
<BR>
The general thinking was always that complex carbohydrates (rice, potatoes,<BR>
etc) released less insulin than simple carbohydrates (fruit, etc). However,<BR>
in the last 10-15 years, this idea has been challenged by the introduction<BR>
of something called the glycemic index (GI). The GI was developed for<BR>
diabetics who need to keep a lid on their insulin release as their bodies<BR>
are not capable of dealing with the excess (or any) insulin. Basically,
the<BR>
GI is a measure of how much insulin is released by a given food. Glucose
is<BR>
defined as 100 and all values are relative to it. Unfortunately, only a<BR>
handful of foods have even been tested as it is quite expensive to do. Also,<BR>
there is a lot of individual variability so treat these numbers as<BR>
guidelines only.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that these values only apply if the food in question is eaten
by<BR>
itself. As soon as you combine foods off of this list, the value changes.<BR>
And, if the food in question is eaten with fat, protein or fiber, the GI<BR>
drops as digestion, and hence, gastric emptying is slowed lessening the<BR>
insulin response. Oh, yeah, number closer to 100 release more insulin than<BR>
numbers farther from it.<BR>
<BR>
Sugars Grains/cereals Legumes<BR>
glucose 100 white bread 69 beans<BR>
fructose 20 wheat bread 72 soy 15<BR>
maltose 105 brown rice 66 baked 40<BR>

<BR>
You may notice that fructose (fruit sugar) has a very low GI. This has<BR>
prompted some to suggest it as the optimal form of carbo for exercise. This<BR>
is not the case as too much fructose in one's diet can cause diarrhea and<BR>
elevate blood triglycerides. Next time, I will talk about the consequences<BR>
of the GI for both athletes and sedentary people.<BR>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Last time, I introduced somthing called the Glycemic Index (GI) which is
a<BR>
measure of how much insulin is released by a given carbohydrate food<BR>
(relative to glucose). Now, I want to talk about the consequences of the
GI<BR>
at different times during the day.<BR>
<BR>
Sedentary person: Let's say you eat a carbohydrate meal during the day.
If<BR>
you eat a high GI food, you will get a high insulin response and, since<BR>
glycogen levels are high, glucose will be stored equally to skeletal muscle<BR>
and adipose (fat) tissue equally. So, you should try to stick with low GI<BR>
foods for most of your meals.<BR>
<BR>
Before exercise: For a long time, it was thought that taking in carbs before<BR>
exercise might be detrimental as it would cause an insulin burst and<BR>
ultimately lower blood glucose levels. This was found in several studies.<BR>
However, if carbs are taken in at least an hour before exercise, insulin<BR>
levels have a chance to return to normal and exercise performance is not<BR>
impaired. (1) Also, low GI foods (beans, etc) make an excellent pre-exercise<BR>
carb source as they don't realease much insulin anyway.<BR>
<BR>
During exercise: At this time, the situation changes and some interesting<BR>
things are going on hormonally. The body releases epinephrine and<BR>
nor-epinephrine which increase heart rate in addition to other things and<BR>
also inhibits insulin release. This causes insulin levels to drop increasing<BR>
the mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. Since glycogen
is<BR>
being used up, there occurs an increase in glucose transport to the muscle<BR>
which is insulin independent. Thus, it is best to drink a high GI fluid<BR>
(preferably glucose or glucose polymer) as it will empty from the stomach<BR>
quickly and reach the muscles faster than a low GI carbohydrate would. This<BR>
applies for any exercise session lasting 1.5-2 hours.<BR>
<BR>
If you are exercising more than two hours, something else is going on. In<BR>
addition to depletion of muscle glycogen, liver glycogen is also being used<BR>
up. Thus, it is best to combine glucose (or polymer) with fructose (which<BR>
preferentially increases liver glycogen) and drink it constantly during<BR>
exercise.<BR>
<BR>
But, how much carbohydrate should be used during exercise? The composition<BR>
of drinks during exercise has been the study of much research and<BR>
advertising. The first drink on the market was Gatorade and it has been<BR>
joined by dozens of others (Cytomax, Endura, and Hydra Fuel to name a few).<BR>
Without going into too many details regarding the research that has been<BR>
done which deals with not only concentration, type of carbohydrate,<BR>
absorption, gastric emptying and a lot of other stuff, I'll cut to the chase<BR>
and make recommendations.<BR>
<BR>
The first problem during exercise that must be dealt with is fluid<BR>
replacement. Without adequate fluids, dehydration sets in rapidly and fluid<BR>
loss can be 1 liter/ hour during intense exercise. So, adequate fluid intake<BR>
is crucial to athletic performance. At a dehydration level of 1%,<BR>
performance suffers by 3%. At a dehydration level of 5% or more, death can<BR>
result.<BR>
<BR>
The second is maintaining carbohydrate levels during exercise. Well,<BR>
unfortunately, the addition of carbohydrate to water tends to retard gastric<BR>
emptying of the water and thus impairs fluid replacement. A good guideline<BR>
is to take in 100-200 calories of carbs (25-50 grams) every half hour split<BR>
into 2 8oz feedings. Basically, this works out to a 5-8% concentration of<BR>
carbohydrate which has been found to maximize gastric emptying while still<BR>
maintaining blood glucose levels. Up to 2-3% of this may be fructose. Higer<BR>
fructose concnetrations may cause gastro-intstinal upset (i.e. diarrhea)
and<BR>
should be avoided. Most commercial drinks fall somewhere into this<BR>
concentration range. (2)<BR>
<BR>
Also, many drinks add electrolytes (sodium and potassium) to their drinks.<BR>
This has been found to increase glucose and water uptake and also increases<BR>
the palatibility of the drinks making it more likely that the athlete will<BR>
drink them frequently.<BR>
<BR>
As to which drink is the best, that's a tough call. Most have some reason
to<BR>
claim being the best. Cytomax has alpha-poly-lactate which is supposed to<BR>
buffer lactic acid. Endura has extra magnesium as they claim endurance<BR>
athletes are chronically depleted. Basically, pick one that you like the<BR>
taste of. No matter how good one of these drinks is, they are useless if
you<BR>
don't like the taste and don't drink it.<BR>
<BR>
To digress slightly, protein is not needed during exercise unless it is<BR>
extremely intense and of long duration (i.e. Tour De France, Race Across<BR>
America, etc).<BR>
<BR>
Next time I will talk about one of the most controversial areas of<BR>
carbohydrate intake which is carbohydrates immediately after exercise.<BR>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Continuing from last time, I would like to talk about carbo intake<BR>
immediately after exercise.<BR>
<BR>
At this point, assuming you have worked out a sufficient amount, muscle<BR>
glycogen is depleted immediately after workout, even if you took in carbs<BR>
during exercise. This has a couple of consequences. First, and foremost,<BR>
glucose transport is high due to low levels of muscle glycogen. Also,<BR>
glycogen synthase (the enzyme responsible for turning glucose into glycogen)<BR>
activity is high. Now, two things can happen.<BR>
<BR>
1. If you don't take in any carbs after your workout, the body will take<BR>
protein (muscle) and lactate and go through a process called gluconeogenesis<BR>
(literally the making of new glucose) and convert it into glucose. This
is<BR>
bad as it has the potential to break down muscle tissue.<BR>
<BR>
2. You can take in carbs, satisfying your muscle's needs and avoid muscle<BR>
breakdown. This is the better choice.<BR>
<BR>
But, what kind of carbs are best for glycogen repletion? My professor<BR>
suggested that low glycemic index carbs be used so that an insulin response<BR>
would be avoided which would impair muscular glycogen repletion. However,<BR>
glycogen synthase activity only stays elevated for 2 hours after exercise
so<BR>
low GI carbs may be too slow in digestingto be of any use. Michael Colgan<BR>
suggests glucose polymers with a little pure glucose so that insulin will
be<BR>
stimulated to increase glucose transport into the cell. He contends that
the<BR>
high insulin response won't push glucose into the fat cells since the<BR>
muscles will take it up too quickly (1). One study found that simple<BR>
carbohydrates (high GI) were better than complex, fiber-rich carbs (low
GI)<BR>
for glycogen repletion after six hours but that no difference was found<BR>
after 20 hours for muscle glycogen (2). Another study found that combining<BR>
112 grams of carbs with 40.7 grams of protein maximized muscle glycogen
due<BR>
to a higher insulin response when compared to either the carbs or protein<BR>
taken separately (3). And, finally, a recent muscle magazine suggested<BR>
taking in simple carbs while doing low intensity exercise so that insulin<BR>
independent glucose transport could occur withoutfear of insulin response<BR>
(4). To me, this last suggestion makes the most sense. With it, you neither<BR>
risk an insulin response (which may or may not drive some glucose into fat<BR>
cells) and get good quick glucose uptake and synthesis by the muscles. The<BR>
key is to make the exercise intensity low enough that you aren't depleting<BR>
more carbohydrate than you are ingesting.<BR>
<BR>
The magazine suggests 10 minutes of easy exercise during which time 75-100<BR>
grams of simple carbs (like fruit juice) are sipped.<BR>
<BR>
In actuality, a study was done that backs this up indirectly (5). The study<BR>
was looking at carbs immediately prior to exercise (which as stated has
been<BR>
found to cause an insulin response and reactive hypoglycemia or low blood<BR>
sugar) to see if mild exercise would blunt the insulin response. A warm
up<BR>
done consisting of 5 minutes easy spinning, and 20 minutes of slightly<BR>
harder riding with 10 sec intervals thrown in. During this time, a variety<BR>
of carb drinks were ingested at either 300 or 600 ml. At the onset of<BR>
exercise, increased blood glucose levels were found with only a<BR>
slightincrease in insulin levels after a seven minute break. So, carbs taken<BR>
during light exercise have the capacity to increase blood glucose (and<BR>
presumably muscle glycogen when it is depleted) without an insulin response.<BR>
The magazine suggests 10 minutes of easy exercise. Every supplement company<BR>
makes some type of post-workout carb drink. Personally, I've used Twinlab<BR>
Ultra Fuel and Gatorlode. Gatorlode is good because it's cheap but it<BR>
doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles like chromium (which may help)<BR>
or even fructose as it is mainly glucose polymer. Another option is plain<BR>
fruit juice although you have to drink quite a bit to get a lot of carbs<BR>
(figure 3-4 cups to get 60-90 grams of carbs). Also, it may not be a bad<BR>
idea to use a drink containing some fructose (or add some yourself) to help<BR>
replenish liver glycogen which can be very depleted following exercise.<BR>
<BR>
When I talk about protein, I'll complete this explanation and talk a little<BR>
more about protein after exercise. Next time, carbohydrate needs for<BR>
athletes.<BR>

Ok, to wrap up carbohydrates, let me talk a little about how much<BR>
carbohydrate athletes need. For endurance athletes, it's a little more clear<BR>
cut than for weight training in terms of how much one needs. However, when
I<BR>
talk about fats, we'll see that the old ideas regarding carb intake may
not<BR>
necessarily be correct.<BR>
<BR>
The general thinking is that carbs should make up anywhere from 65-75% of<BR>
the diet of an endurance athlete. Since may calories are expended during<BR>
training, sufficient carbs must be ingested to maintain muscle glycogen
so<BR>
that training can continue. One study found that people ingesting 40%<BR>
calories from carbohydrates slowly depleted their muscle glycogen to the<BR>
point that they could not exercise. By contrast, a group eating 70% carbs<BR>
was able to maintain muscle glycogen levels even with daily training.<BR>
<BR>
What about for strength athletes? Well, here the waters muddy a bit and,<BR>
quite honestly, I haven't seen a lot of research. One theory has it that,
as<BR>
with endurance athletes, the majority of calories should be in the form
of<BR>
carbs. Other sources suggest that only enough carbs should be taken in to<BR>
prevent ketosis (buildup of incompletely burned fatty acids) with the<BR>
remainder of calories coming from protein.<BR>
<BR>
Ultimately, the amount of carbs necessary to maintain athletic performance<BR>
will vary with the athlete and the type and amount of training. The 65-75%<BR>
of calories should provide a good guideline. As a brief teaser, let me<BR>
mention that there is some more recent research that indicates that less<BR>
carbs and more fat may be more conducive toathletic performance and bodyfat<BR>
loss but you'll have to wait a little for me to get to that.<BR>
<BR>
Next time, protein and athletes.<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
It's been a while since I've written anything. Everything has been going<BR>
well here. I'm off the Prednisone now finally and everything is fine, I
have<BR>
UC for those who are new or don't remember. I came off of the prednisone
<BR>
fine the first time also but then flared 3 months later. I was on Asacol<BR>
then and eating a lot of wheat bread, so it wasn't doing it's job.<BR>
That's when I decieded to try the diet..starting in May. My doctor has <BR>
now switched me to Pentasa. I also ran out of Pentasa pills one weekend<BR>
waiting for the pharmacy to get some more. I had 8 pills for the weekend<BR>
and was supposed to be taking 16 a day so...I was a bit worried but <BR>
everything was fine. I took one a time instead of the four and had <BR>
no problems at all. That was also my first days off of Prednisone too.<BR>
So maybe in a few months I'll ask to reduce my Pentasa. I'm starting to
<BR>
wonder if it's doing anything for me at all. I occassionally miss <BR>
taking it at all and have no problems then either.<BR>
<BR>
I did a bit of experimenting last week with recipes. I added a bit<BR>
of cinnamon to the muffins, which was a good change. I also used the<BR>
sweet and sour lentil recipe but instead of using lentils I used a combination<BR>
of some green beans, peas and some onions. I cooked the beans and<BR>
peas in the microwave, sauteed the onions in the butter and combined everything<BR>
together for a few minutes till it was hot then I put it in the refrigerator<BR>
to make a cold &quot;three&quot; bean like salad. It was good.<BR>
<BR>
I got a couple of recipe books at the library this week and I'm finding<BR>
some that look good. Some were allergy cook-books for people with various<BR>
sensitivities to wheat, milk, eggs, sugar etc. So I'll let you <BR>
know if any of them turn out any good. <BR>
<BR>
Most everyone says that the Lois Lang bread is good. Has anyone tried<BR>
that with pecans instead of almonds? I can't find almonds locally around<BR>
here and don't have enough storage place to store 25 lbs worth.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine questions?? What's the status of that? It sounded like a great idea<BR>
to me. I'd like to ask Elaine about Pentasa. What she thought of it and<BR>
whether we need to get off of it to make the diet truly &quot;successful&quot;.
If<BR>
we do get off of it what should we be taking instead?<BR>
<BR>
Well that's about all for now.<BR>
<BR>
Take care everyone,<BR>

From: michael cabarles,cabarles@geko.net.au,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to all the new one's<BR>
<BR>
I've written about this before but I feel I should repeat this warning<BR>
since I didn't take my own advice and found myself in this life threatening<BR>
situation.<BR>
<BR>
KETOSIS - BEWARE!<BR>
The introductory diet in Elaine's book is dangerous if followed for more<BR>
than a 5 days as recommended. If not closely monitored as to caloric<BR>
requirements, It may not include enough carbs to sustain life indefinitely.<BR>
I was on this diet for more than 2 weeks and went into KETOSIS (lack of<BR>
carbs) where the body starts burning fats and protein. This is the essence<BR>
of the Atkins diet and there are numerous warnings on the net about this<BR>
diet. Ketosis can lead to a drop in PH (acid) in the blood (not good for<BR>
those with IBD whose acid levels are already high. this forces the kidneys<BR>
to compensate to neutralise this acid by producing large amounts of<BR>
bicarbonates and the lungs hyperventilate to remove the CO2 in an attempt<BR>
to buffer the large amounts of acid being produced. In addition a rise in<BR>
potassium occurs in the blood which may if exceeding 6.5 cause cardiac<BR>
arrythmias and death (even in healthy young individuals) many in the 70's<BR>
died as a result of this compensatory mechanism. The danger remains today!<BR>
<BR>
I was suspicious of my carbohydrate intake because I was constantly tired<BR>
depressed. So I got some keto tabs from the chemist and to my surprise by<BR>
glucose was fine but my ketones were way up to 4 (Though this a mild<BR>
reading the danger lies in staying at this level over a period of weeks)<BR>
you should be at 0 level for normal metabolism functioning. As soon as I<BR>
moved to correct this My energy level shot up my depression cleared (things<BR>
just seeemed bearable even though my condition did not change drastically<BR>
and the most notable thing was that my circulation improved, My hands and<BR>
feet warmed up considerably) I added fresh squeezed and strained fruit<BR>
juice to breakfast, carrots and zuchhini, swedes to lunch (all pressure<BR>
cooked or well steamed) and pumpkin to dinner (cooked till really soft)<BR>
It's a bit monotonous but I feel much more able to cope with my job and<BR>
life in general!<BR>

Subject: Re: Hello, UC question.<BR>
From: ShodanRT@aol.com,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Dear Meg &amp; Matt, I also have UC &amp; have been helped tremendously
thru Elaine's<BR>
diet. I've been on it since Apr.1,1995. Prior to that, I'd been on<BR>
azulphadine since diagnosed approx. 8 years ago. From almost day 1 on the<BR>
diet, I noticed major changes. It took a couple of months from there, but
the<BR>
healing was progressive from the beginning. I've had a couple of minor<BR>
backslides (some diahrea, blood) but they usually followed a food risk I<BR>
took, and were shortlived. Prior to the diet I had 10 years of severe<BR>
diahrea and major bleeding. The azulphadine kept it mildly controlled, but<BR>
even with that I was definately sick. I looked sick (gray palor, puffed,<BR>
bloated) I felt and I acted sick. By contrast, if you met me today (a year<BR>
and a quarter into the diet), unless I told you I had a chronis disease,
you<BR>
wouldn't know. I live a full active life, work full time, play hard (I've<BR>
been pacticing martial arts for 13 years) and am able to share and enjoy
more<BR>
fully, my marriage to my husband and best friend of almost 30 years and
my<BR>
relationship with my 2 adult children. Has the diet helped me? Its given
me<BR>
my life back! I have a question for those who share that the diet hasn't<BR>
really worked for them. This is not a judgement, just curiousity. Has the<BR>
effort been 100%? Even Elaine says the diet doesn't work for everyone, its<BR>
just that it works so well for me, I can't understand how or why it doesn't<BR>
work for all. I know that there are varying degrees to this illness but
I was<BR>
awfully sick and seemed to be at high risk of bleeding to death, not to<BR>
mention always having to be in a 30 second sprinting range of the nearest<BR>
bathroom. I guess what I'm saying to those who have tried it and don't<BR>
believe it works, is that if your initial attempt wasn't 100% wholehearted,<BR>
maybe this lifesaving diet is worth a second try. Wishing you all luck and<BR>
love, Rachel<BR>
