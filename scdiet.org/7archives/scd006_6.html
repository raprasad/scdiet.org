Bill L or any other new members:<BR>
<BR>
If you have questions about the diet you would like to ask Elaine, post
<BR>
the questions as you do any other topics and put &quot;Questions for Elaine&quot;
<BR>
as the subject. I will collect these questions together and fax them <BR>
to Elaine. She has offered to answer questions from the group and I <BR>
think it is probably easier for her than answering the same question <BR>
for 20 different people. Posting them to the group instead of just <BR>
e-mailing them to me directly gives other people the opportunity to see
<BR>
the questions and to possibly respond if they already have some <BR>
information.<BR>
<BR>
We have sent one set of questions to Elaine, if anyone would like a <BR>
copy of questions and answers let me know and I can forward them to <BR>
you.<BR>

Thanks for the welcome!<BR>
<BR>
I think I'm going to miss more than just donuts and junk food, I'm <BR>
seriously missing pasta and bread right now (my main staple along with <BR>
cheese, fruits and veges when I was well) and I'm always sooooo hungry.
<BR>
It feels like I'm missing some really important part of my diet...and so
<BR>
many eggs are bad!<BR>
<BR>
I haven't been able to make the yoghurt yet and this has been really hard
<BR>
for me because I hate gelatin and am dying for something to eat...<BR>
<BR>
Good health to you...<BR>
<BR>
Take it easy,<BR>

Marla,<BR>

I remember!!!! The first few months on the diet were murder, can't deny<BR>
it. I thought I would go crazy going down supermarket aisles, passing the
potato<BR>
chips and bagels. My weight dropped from 148 lbs. (a little high) to 128
lbs<BR>
(bye bye bustline.)<BR>
What's worse, I didn't really see a big improvement past the first few<BR>
weeks. I was always hungry. And I was cooking for my family, turning out<BR>
luscious meals that I then sat and watched them eat while I munched lettuce
and<BR>
cooked peas. I really never went more than a few days without at least a
bit of<BR>
a cheat, such as a helping of something from supper. That stunted my progress<BR>
too. Finally I decided to can it, I didn't feel my progress was good enough
to<BR>
bother any more and I bought a bag of potato chips and ate them all. They<BR>
didn't taste as good as I thought they would, and the next day I had a whole<BR>
bunch of horrible symptoms return that I had forgotten about, fatigue, gas,<BR>
diarrhea, nausea, and more. So back I went on the diet again. This has been
a<BR>
repeating cycle for me, I'm a very slow learner!! But nonetheless I was
able to<BR>
let go of food in this way, eating something and then suffering for it,
you get<BR>
conditioned like Pavlov's dogs I think. As time has gone on my cravings
for<BR>
carbohydrates have eased up. I have no desire for sugar at all as it makes
me<BR>
super sick within one half hour, I have to go to bed for the rest of the
day and<BR>
all night and will be groggy the next day as well. I have established a
certain<BR>
number of foods that I actually like alot and I keep those on hand so I
can<BR>
really fill my face when I need to. I eat a whole lot of eggs, three for<BR>
breakfast at least and then make my nut muffins with them as well. I used
to be<BR>
strict vegetarian, so eating eggs is still not easy for me, but I do it
because<BR>
there isn't always a lot of other quick, easy, and filling things available,<BR>
especially first thing in the morning. Well I could go on but the bottom
line<BR>
is this. For me, I no longer have an option as far as I am concerned. <BR>
Here are some of the things I rather like that help me through. I make<BR>
yogurt from 18% table cream and eat lots of it, just plain. Lots of fat
there<BR>
but it keeps my weight from dropping below 130 so I do it regardless. Also<BR>
someone in the group pointed out that the amount of fat in the yogurt is
not all<BR>
that high. I make meatballs and roll them in parmesan and cayenne, then
bake<BR>
them in the oven. I put half of them in spaghetti sauce for the family but
I<BR>
keep half for me and they are really great with a crispy coating like that.
I<BR>
cook lots of red lentils and keep them in the fridge and have them any time<BR>
during the day with any variation such as curry spices or just plain butter.
I<BR>
fall back on those a lot, they are filling. Nut muffins are good, and with<BR>
honey and butter they are totally satisfying. I eat lots of avocadoes mashed<BR>
with mayonnaise. I sprinkle pork chops with cayenne and salt and fry them,<BR>
makes once again a nice crispy coating. I mix club soda with apple juice
and<BR>
grape juice, that's good too. I keep dry wines on hand for when I need to<BR>
forget all of this, it soothes my soul. That's important too! <BR>
For all of this my reward is that I step out of the house and never think<BR>
where the next bathroom is. Bloating is gone. Oversleeping too. Periods
are<BR>
definitely easier. I never go to the doctor anymore. <BR>
I would like to be cured, not just controlled. My success is tenuous, I<BR>
can be thrown off by factors unknown. So I am always trying many herbal<BR>
remedies, I spend a lot of money trying to find a cure. If I find something<BR>
that really works, I will share it and then we can all hit our favorite<BR>
restaurants and eat all those foods like normal people do. In the meantime,<BR>
stick to the group and we might be able to see you through this!<BR>
<BR>
Good health to you,<BR>

Hello Marla ... and welcome to the group.<BR>
I read your note to Carol 8/24/96 Soooo hungery.<BR>
<BR>
WEll it certainly can be a nagging feeling that tuggs at your tummy all
day.<BR>
As we find the other foods to replace the multitude of sugars and starches<BR>
we grew accustom to,the hunger does subside. I still find myself looking
for<BR>
something to eat durring the day, but generally it is my own doing, not<BR>
having taken time to make something to eat. It does take one a while to
kick<BR>
the habit of the quick and convenient starch and sugar mentallity. So the<BR>
fridge must always contain foods I can either snack on, or make myself a<BR>
meal in a hurry. Here are some thoughts you may wish to try. <BR>
<BR>
Snacks:<BR>
Fresh washed small carrots any time of day.They are generally sweet.<BR>
Apples, a variety always washed and in the fridge ( 2-3 dozen)<BR>
Oranges, grapefruit, plums, (grapes if you can eat them)<BR>
Any other fruit if you find you can tolerate it.(Diarrhea)<BR>
I love grapes, but can only handle approx. 3 or 4 in a day. (gas)<BR>
Fresh tomatoes, cucumbers,celery if you can handle it.<BR>
I keep some dates and walnuts or almonds as well to snack on.<BR>
They are tastey when eaten together <BR>
Bananas when they are ripe. Black spots on skin.<BR>
<BR>
Breakfast:<BR>
Slice up one or two ripe bananas, into a bowl, pour some home made<BR>
yoghart over add one teaspoon of honey. <BR>
Or mix bananas with sliced apples or oranges, and honey.<BR>
<BR>
Lunch:<BR>
I often use this for a fast and easy meal.<BR>
2-3 tablespoons of OLIVE oil in a fry pan, dice 1/2 a green bell<BR>
pepper 4-5 green onions, or spanish, 2-3 stocks of boy-choy or celery<BR>
either green tomatoe, or if ripe add to pan late.<BR>
2 or 3 slices of egg plant or zucchini.<BR>
2 scrambled eggs in a seperate pan.<BR>
<BR>
I am not overly concerned about eating 2 or 3 eggs a day, as my<BR>
cholesterol (spelling) is lower now than before I was on the diet. <BR>
Eating a large amount of fruits and veggies, seems to take care of<BR>
that. As well exercise.<BR>
I drink weak blk tea or some coffee with a teaspoon of honey, or lemon<BR>
In the restaurants I cut the coffee with half water.<BR>
There is not much food to be found in a restaurant for me, other than<BR>
some fruit salad,or veggies with some shrimp and egg. I avoid them as<BR>
much as possiable.<BR>
<BR>
The Last Meal of the Day<BR>
<BR>
Always all the veggies I want to eat, (with butter on them) with<BR>
either beef, fish, chichen, turkey. No sauces.<BR>
I try to have some left over meats from this meal for next midday.<BR>
Fish is a meal I find very easy to digest.With butter and lemon. <BR>
<BR>
Hope you can find something in the above you can use. <BR>
Next Feb. will be four years for me. Still alive and kicking. <BR>
If I can do anyone can. Good health<BR>

Subject: questions and answers, including some for Elaine<BR>
From: TRG,tguar@icom.ca,Internet<BR>
scd@filmgraphics.com,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Michael:<BR>
I have only sent one letter so far by the server and I got a copy sent to
me<BR>
as well, is this normal? Does this mean something, like my letter couldn't<BR>
be sent or anything like that?<BR>
Also, I asked you before about the amount of sucrose in fruit. Does that<BR>
list that you have include the amount in grams? Could you give me some<BR>
numbers just to get an idea? Maybe for one fruit that is relatively high<BR>
and one that is about mid range?<BR>
<BR>
Marla:<BR>
Welcome to the group. I just had to write because your situation sounds
so<BR>
similar to mine. I am a future grad student at McMaster University. I have<BR>
been accepted but the supervisor I was suppose to work with ran out of<BR>
funding and so I have to find another one. I have had UC for 2 years and
it<BR>
is limited to the last 10&quot; of my colon, so probably in the same area
as<BR>
yours. My predominant symptom is definitely bleeding, and as the flare up<BR>
gets worse pain and diarrhea usually follow. My medications include Asacol<BR>
(4 (400mg)/day when in remission and up to 8/day when having a flare) as<BR>
well as Salofalk every night during a flare up. It sounds like you may be<BR>
taking a little more Asacol than me, and do you take the Salofalk every<BR>
other day even when not flaring up? I would imagine that you have some kind<BR>
of drug plan through the school, but if you haven't, have you heard of the<BR>
Trillium program? Both of those drugs are covered under it.<BR>
I've been on the diet now for almost 5 months and have seen steady<BR>
improvement from about week 3 until just recently when I have been having
a<BR>
flare, but I think I have figured out what has been causing it so I will<BR>
soon me back to normal. I started the diet after suffering a flare up for<BR>
over 5 months that my usual medications were not able to help.<BR>
I can't answer all your questions but I might be able to help with some.
I<BR>
was worried about the amount of eggs and butter as well. I try substituting<BR>
for these with fruit puree (baby food prunes or applesauce, unsweetened
of<BR>
course). And even using olive oil sometimes because at least the fats in
it<BR>
are monounsaturated. It doesn't work with all recipes but I find out by<BR>
experimenting. I also use the eggs that Michael mentioned which are lower<BR>
in satured fats and cholesterol, but higher in the omega-3 fatty acids and<BR>
vitamin C. The brands that I have found available up here are the<BR>
Bonn-ee-best, Nature Egg and the Born 3 eggs. Eating a lot of fiber also<BR>
helps with this, and this diet is definitely high in fiber for those who
can<BR>
manage it.<BR>
I found a recipe for pasta that included Xanthan gum to be used as sort
of a<BR>
glue to hold things together but found out that this is not allowed on the<BR>
diet so I am still searching. Right now I am attempting to find a version<BR>
of gnocchi that might work, so I will let the group know when I discover<BR>
anything.<BR>
I am still confused about Lactaid myself. Elaine says that it can be<BR>
damaging to the liver. I don't really understand why, but it has something<BR>
to do with too much galactose getting into our blood. She says there are<BR>
some books about this and I think I will ask her for the references.<BR>
As for going out to eat, I don't really do it anymore. I don't know much<BR>
about how sushi is prepared so if you do, then maybe you can still eat it,<BR>
or maybe it would be okay with a slight variation. I have found one or two<BR>
restaurants that have some dishes that I am pretty sure are okay. But look<BR>
on the bright side, think how much cheaper it is to just eat at home.<BR>
I was also worried about calcium. But yogurt has just as much as milk so<BR>
lately I try to eat some yogurt almost every day. Yogurt of course has many<BR>
other benefits, like providing good bacteria and protein. But almonds also<BR>
have calcium not in very high amounts but if you are eating the nut muffins<BR>
or bread you are actually going to get a lot of calcium. I can't remember<BR>
the amount but I will let you know when I find out.<BR>
Well, hope this helps.<BR>
<BR>
Carol:<BR>
Just to let you know that I have appreciated the humour in your last couple<BR>
of letters. That comment about us picking guinea pigs on a rotating basis<BR>
still makes me chuckle.<BR>
<BR>
Bill L:<BR>
Just wondering if you are planning to stay on the diet for the rest of your<BR>
life or if you will someday introduce the forbidden foods back into your<BR>
diet as suggested in the book? Or have you tried this already with no success?<BR>
<BR>
Kevin:<BR>
Have you started introducing any new foods yet? Just wondering how it's<BR>
been going. Hope you are still symptom and drug free.<BR>
<BR>
Christine:<BR>
I have some questions for Elaine.<BR>
The first one is something that has already been asked and answered but
I am<BR>
still confused on the issue. Maybe someone in the group can explain it to<BR>
me better. If the problem with Lactaid milk is that the lactose is already<BR>
broken down into galactose and glucose and this makes the galactose levels<BR>
to high to be safe, then why is yogurt okay? Yogurt has all it's lactose<BR>
broken down into those same sugars. The only difference is that in yogurt<BR>
this break down is achieved by bacteria and in Lactaid it's by a digestive<BR>
enzymes. Elaine also mentions that some books have been written on this<BR>
topic. Can she give me the references?<BR>
Also, does she know about the sucrose in fruits and does she think we should<BR>
try to minimize the amounts of fruits in our diets that are high in sucrose?<BR>
<BR>
Well, that's all for now. Take care everyone.<BR>

Here's one diet posted on the alt.support.crohns-colitis newsgroup:::<BR>

&gt;I've been diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis for about one and half years<BR>
&gt;now. I'm currently having my second major flare-up attack........I know<BR>

&gt;dismiss that as nonsense. Any similar experiences, or advice re: getting<BR>
&gt;on a special diet please e-mail: NGrupp@aol.com.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I was diag, with UC in 1979 &amp; the 1st thing the Dr, said was, you will<BR>
have to change your diet entirely. I wish I could find the orig. diet for<BR>
you, but that was many moves ago. No. 1 priority was no sweet milk or<BR>
other dairy EXCEPT: buttermilk, &quot;natural&quot; aged cheddar cheese
(experiment<BR>
with plain yoghurt). This is due to acid of a certain type in these foods.<BR>
No. 1a (still dealing with acid) was: No ripe tomato products (raw or<BR>
sauces) or citrus fruits or juices. Green (or almost green) tomatoes are<BR>
OK. The only fruit to eat MORE of is apples (in moderation - they<BR>
irritate some colons). Apple juice = very good! Experiment with grape<BR>
juice, bananas. INCREASE: intake of vinegar/pickles, mint &amp; mint tea
for<BR>
comfort (check there is no citric acid in it). Another problem: leavening<BR>
agents or baking powder/soda, experiment with those. In flares or if you<BR>
have an irritable bowel anyway, corn and other roughage can irritate;<BR>
carefully experiment with these. No carbonated drinks, especially during<BR>
flare.<BR>
I WAS AT THE POINT OF EMERGENCY SURGERY; THIS MAN SAVED MY LIFE (&amp; saved<BR>
me from colectomy). He practices in Pittsburg, I sure miss him (Dr.<BR>
Krishnan A. Gopal) but he was my guardian angel when I needed him. He also<BR>
told me that most doctors don't believe diet matters, which I was told by<BR>
many subsequent doctors! But I never have a flare anymore unless I break<BR>
my diet (I am a pizza &amp; spaghetti lover ~ they are killers). I've kept
my<BR>
colon for 17 years thru this diet. <BR>

NOW, HERE'S another diet letter<BR>
Date : 1 Apr 1996 20:02:45 GMT<BR>
From : Gordon, Sandra at University of Saskatchewan<BR>
Subject: Foods : To Eat or Not to Eat<BR>
<BR>
Well I am pretty lucky for foods. There is three catagories that I use:<BR>
NEVER unless I want to be ill<BR>
Lamb, MAJOR no no<BR>
Pork that is not super lean<BR>
Slurpies from Mac's (7-11 is okay)<BR>
Real Whipped cream<BR>
Deep fried foods (If I deep fried them things seem to go better, <BR>
could <BR>
be I pay more attention to the oil temp and the type of oil)<BR>
<BR>
If I am feeling okay I can tolerate small amounts<BR>
Milk to drink<BR>
ice cream<BR>
nuts and berries<BR>
fruit (I don't actually like that many)<BR>
Fast food<BR>
<BR>
If I am felling terrible I live on the following<BR>
Chicken breasts (any cooking method is okay)<BR>
Eggs, however I can get them<BR>
Bread bread and more bread<BR>
Potatoes (I could just live on these alone if I had to!! )<BR>
White rice<BR>
soda crackers<BR>
<BR>
That is most of it, I don't find any trouble with spices or strange sauces.
I <BR>
don't like cheese and I can only ever have one glass of milk to drink in
a day.<BR>
I keep milk in my diet (in ceral, mashed potatoes etc) for the added fat
and <BR>
nutrients even if I don't feel well. I find eggs are the best if you are
going<BR>
out somewhere and you want an easy on the gut meal that won't cause problems.<BR>

My no-nos include: ice cream, milk and most milk products except for <BR>
hard cheeses like cheddar and colby, wheat, rye or any other type of <BR>
bread other than bread made from almond flour, soy, chocolate (boo hoo)
<BR>
and even carob (sob) and most things high in sugar. Honey seems fine. <BR>
Not too many citrus fruits can pass through this plumbing without a <BR>

&gt;Hi everyone,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I've been reading all these emails about the homemade yogourt and how
good it<BR>
&gt;is, but some people have mentioned that they are Lactose and still eating<BR>
&gt;yogourt? Are you all taking Lactaid before? or is this yogourt made
with some<BR>
&gt;kind of substitute? Could someone please tell me, because I love yogourt,
but<BR>
&gt;am Lactose and really don't want to be taking Lactaid. I've found that
by<BR>
&gt;cutting out dairy products I have seen a significant change in my health,
e.g.<BR>
&gt;not having to go to the bathroom twenty times a day and not having that
feeling<BR>
&gt;of bloatness.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Anyone who has ulcerative colitis and is trying this yogourt can you<BR>
&gt;please give<BR>
&gt;me some info?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;thanks,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;vicki<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hi Vicki,<BR>
<BR>
Lactose is a disacharide sugar found in milk and most other dairy products.<BR>
This means that it is composed of two monosacharide sugars joined together.<BR>
They are glucose and galactose. The glucose is immediately available to
the<BR>
body but the galactose must be processed by the liver to form glucose as<BR>
well. By saying you are lactose, I'm assuming you mean that you are<BR>
&quot;lactose intollerant&quot; that is to say that you lack the digestive
enzymes<BR>
needed to spilt lactose in half. That means that it proceeds undigested<BR>
into the lower parts of the digestive tract where it provides food for<BR>
bacteria that produce gas and other toxins. Most people from Asia and<BR>
Africa are genetically deficient in this regard and so have a problem with<BR>
lactose intolerance. Most of them don't realise it because their diets are<BR>
not high in lactose-containing products. but when they begin to adopt a<BR>
Westrern diet, then they begin to have problems with mucus and bloating<BR>
that you described. I have UC and have always had a problem with dairy<BR>
products. Cream and icecream milk and chocolate in particular. Cheeses<BR>
mentiioned in the book are ok in moderation, but the home-made yoghurt is<BR>
definitely a winner with me. I have it every day and since begining the<BR>
diet, the persistent nasal congestion I had is no longer with me. (I don;t<BR>
know if this is related but, even though I've had the flu of late, my nose<BR>
has not dripped at all (just headache and fever). I highly reccommend the<BR>
yoghurt and for best results, (food combining-wise) have it on an empty<BR>
stomach as a snack by itself of mixed with dry curd cottage cheese.<BR>
<BR>
happy yogging (borrowed from deb I think)<BR>
<BR>

Marla:<BR>
Tell your friend in nutrition that you are getting carbohydrates, but only
a<BR>
specific type. It is generally believed that people should get 55% of their<BR>
calories from carbohydrates, and I'm not sure if you can actually achieve<BR>
that, but you should be able to come close. Besides, that reccommendations<BR>
are for healthy people who are able to eat a normal diet. They also<BR>
reccommend getting 25-30g of fiber a day, but I know my doctor put me on
a<BR>
very low fiber diet when my diarrhea was at its worst without any hesitation.<BR>
As far as I know there are no vitamins or minerals that are only found in<BR>
the bread and cereals group. Although your friend may be able to answer<BR>
that better. As long as you eat as much variety as possible then you should<BR>
be okay nutritionally. When I really think about it, I probably eat a lot<BR>
healthier than I use to. No more junk food, although I never really ate<BR>
that much ot it. And not being able to eat pasta, corn and potatoes has<BR>
forced me to be more creative and add a lot more variety to my diet.<BR>
I started the introductory diet for my first attempt at the diet. After
2<BR>
days I was so tired and hungry that I gave up. For my second attempt at
the<BR>
diet I just followed the reccommendations about when to add nuts and seeds<BR>
as well as beans. Other than that I ate whatever I wanted. I tried some
of<BR>
the recipes in the book and that is why I was able to stick to the diet
the<BR>
second time.<BR>
Hope you're still hanging in their, but don't be discouraged if you cheat.<BR>
I think we have all done it, and as you can see, you can always just start<BR>
right back up again with lots of success.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Tina<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Thanks everyone for ideas on what you eat in a day. I'm all thumbs in <BR>
the kitchen and love some of the simple ideas. Avocadoes with the <BR>
mayonaise sound great and I really like the crunchy almond chicken. My <BR>
problem at the moment is that there are foods <BR>
on the diet that I don't seem to tolerate and these limitations seem to
<BR>
be expanding. I've been on the diet a year and never have gotten the <BR>
yogurt to work for me. Lentils seem to be no good and recently I've <BR>
noticed that grapes and salads cause me problems while I could eat them
<BR>
before. I am much much better than my pre diet times but I just don't <BR>
seem to be able to go for more than a couple of weeks without diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
Marla - I was worried about the eggs and meat. I eat a dozen eggs a week
<BR>
and meat most evenings. My doctor was appalled and insisted on a <BR>
cholesterol test after he'd muttered that I was trying to kill myself. <BR>
My cholesterol levels are lower than normal, my Calcium is fine, so is my
<BR>
Vit B 12. These were all concerns for me. Occasionally I get cramps in <BR>
my leg muscles which I take to be lack of Calcium so as a supplement I <BR>
take Jamieson Mega-Cal Calcium - no sugar,starch, salt, ueast, gluten or
<BR>
lactose. I tolerate this fine and I've written to the company for <BR>
conformation of no disaccharides. My hunger pangs became much less when
<BR>
I introduced nuts at 3 months. Eating out is always at a restaurant with
<BR>
a salad bar and I ask lots of questions about how their meat or fish is
<BR>
cooked, also I take my own nut bread.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks everyone for all the support being offered. Amanda<BR>

It seems that I am hearing that people talk about having problems =<BR>
sticking to the diet. I have been trying different diets and things over
=<BR>
the years and this diet is easier than the others that I have tried. I =<BR>
have more recently checked into a fasting program where people don't =<BR>
consume anything except pure water for the period of around 30-40 days.
=<BR>
The longest was 52 days I believe. I tried the fasting myself =<BR>
unsupervised (which you are not supposed to do) while I was working (not
=<BR>
supposed to do that either) for 6 days. I was getting too weak because I
=<BR>
was still working. Yes it is true that you can go 52 days with only and
=<BR>
still stay alive. It is a very interesting program and is a bit =<BR>
complicated to explain but is not practical for me but cures many =<BR>
diseases but possibly not this one. Some diets I made up myself thinking
=<BR>
that I could fix myself but didn't understand enough about the disease =<BR>
to really be able to help myself. I have been on this diet for about a =<BR>
month and personally it has been pretty easy. This is only because I =<BR>
have been on so many diets though. The real trick I think to having =<BR>
discipline on this diet is making the way we eat a habit. Once we form a
=<BR>
habit eating certain things and not eat the &quot;forbidden foods&quot;
we soon =<BR>
forget what the &quot;forbidden foods&quot; taste like and no longer miss
it. The =<BR>
longer we go without the &quot;forbidden foods&quot; the easier it gets.
The more =<BR>
times that we say &quot;sorry I can't eat that because I am on a special
=<BR>
diet&quot; the easier and more normal it gets for us. I am going to stick
to =<BR>
this diet for two years regardless of the results I get from now till =<BR>
then. When I get there I will then decide wether this diet helped or =<BR>
not. Also, pain is a pretty good motivator and I want to get well and =<BR>
get on with my life because I have so many things that I want to do. Of
=<BR>
all the diets and programs that I have been on this one makes more sense
=<BR>
than all the others combined. I tell my self that If I cheat then it =<BR>
will be that much longer to heal and I want to be healed as soon as =<BR>
possible. So...for what it is worth that is my advice take it or leave =<BR>
it. Hope it helps someone.=20<BR>

Jim the problem with commercial y0oghurt is the Lactose. AND of course any<BR>
other sugar they may add. The lactose is in the milk they use to make the<BR>
yoghurt. Commercial yoghurt is only incubated for 6-10 hours. Home-made<BR>
yoghurt made according to the SCD method is incubated for 24 or more hours.<BR>
This removes the lactose only by converting it to more easily digested<BR>
sugars - glucose and galactose.<BR>
<BR>
At present, home made yoghurt is the only alternative.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>RE: Yoghurt - the book indicates that store-bought yoghurt isn't cooked
<BR>
for long enough to kill off enough of the lactose to make it acceptable
<BR>
for your intestinal tract. The lactose, as the theory goes, being a <BR>
complex carbohydrate, will not be properly broken down by the damaged <BR>
scilia(?) of the cells lining your colon, and will remain festering in <BR>
your system as food for the &quot;Bad&quot; bacterias that in force will
further <BR>
damage your cells to the point where they can no longer absorb even <BR>
simple carbos and you will become malnourished, lose weight, bleed <BR>
profusely, and, well, it's just better to make your own yoghurt according
<BR>
to instructions.<BR>

Hello:<BR>
<BR>
I have just joined the list, and would like to inquire about the back <BR>
issues and other mailings mentioned in the 'Welcome to SCD' message I <BR>
received.<BR>
<BR>
I have been religiously on the diet just four weeks now, and am amazed <BR>
at the results. I suspect I have many of the usual questions that <BR>
newcomers to the diet have: how to maintain your weight, how to get <BR>
the right kind of dry curd cottage cheese, sources for bulk nuts in my <BR>
area (Wash D.C.), etc.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance, and thanks for the list!<BR>

<BR>
<HR>Yes, I seem to have managed to have figured it out. I'm back to university<BR>
again full time and feeling great and am no longer in need of the group.<BR>
Thanks to all who have supported me over the past few months. Special thanks<BR>
to Deborah for having the kindness of heart to put this group together.
I<BR>
could never have braved the diet if I had been alone. Good luck to all and
I<BR>
hope you each find health soon.<BR>

&gt;Hi everyone,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I decided to try using my stove with a 60 watt bulb to make the yoghurt<BR>
&gt;and in the meantime look furiously for a yoghurt maker. I *think* that
the<BR>
&gt;temp is okay with the bulb. However, I had one problem in preparation:<BR>
&gt;when it says to mix 1/4 cup of commercial yoghurt with 1/2 cup cooled<BR>
&gt;milk into a paste I seem to get stumped. When I mix them together it<BR>
&gt;doesnt' turn into paste..how can it with more liquid than a solid? Is<BR>
&gt;there something special I was supposed to do? Or is the book incorrect<BR>
&gt;(unlikely)....someone help.....<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Take it easy,<BR>
&gt;Marla<BR>
<BR>
Marla,<BR>
<BR>
This just means mix a little milk into the yoghurt first to thin the<BR>
yoghurt from being custard-like to being more liquid to make it mix more<BR>
evenly into the milk when you pour it back into the bowl of milk. The idea<BR>
is to thin the yoghurt not to thicken the milk at this stage. I have 2<BR>
really basic hints that took me a while to figure out. They are common<BR>
sense really, but I didn't hae much experience in the kitchen when I<BR>
started all this.<BR>
<BR>
1) get yourself a milk pot. This has a spouted section on the rim of the<BR>
saucepan for easy pouring.<BR>
<BR>
2) when the milk is just boiled. place the pot in a sink of water that<BR>
comes half way up the side to speed cooling. This tip (thanks to kevin I<BR>
think) has allowed me to make yoghurt in the morning before work.<BR>
<BR>
3) I have a rice cooker that I use to sterilise the jars and lids before
I<BR>
start. just half an inch of water is all you need. I sterilise the beaters<BR>
of the electric mixer and the candy thermometer (make sure it has a range<BR>
above 100 degrees celsius(boiling))<BR>
<BR>
4) I leave the milk in the pot, and just add the yoghurt when the<BR>
temperature is right and mix with the electric beater in the pot. (beat
on<BR>
low speed, and not longer than 20-30 secs otherwise the milk will froth
up<BR>
and won't fit in the jars. Also the yoghurt will be runny)<BR>
<BR>
Hope these hinits help.<BR>

Still more on yoghurt.<BR>
<BR>
More reasons to be making your own yoghurt, even more so if you are bleeding.<BR>
It turns out yoghurt contains vit.. &quot;k&quot;. Also found in alfalfa,egg
yolks,<BR>
and leafy green vegetables. Essential for the formation of blood clotting<BR>
subtance in our blood, to aid in the control of internal bleeding.<BR>

I found a good site for yogurt production at<BR>
http://www.ext.missouri.edu/publications/xplor/hesguide/foodnut/gh1183.htm<BR>
<BR>
I have copied just a sample of the page and remember to view with<BR>
skepticism anything that condtradicts what Elaine says.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Table 3. Yogurt problem solver.<BR>
<BR>
Water separation of curds and whey:<BR>
<BR>
Incubation time too long, allowing formation of too much acid.<BR>
<BR>
Shorten incubation time and refrigerate yogurt as soon as it<BR>
becomes firm.<BR>
<BR>
Insufficient heat treatment of milk.<BR>
<BR>
Either milk was not heated to 200 degrees F or it was not held<BR>
at 200 degrees F as<BR>
directed for thin or firm yogurt. Heat treatment changes the<BR>
milk proteins so that the<BR>
yogurt is firmer and whey does not separate so easily from<BR>
curds.<BR>
<BR>
Yogurt does not become firm:<BR>
<BR>
Inactive culture.<BR>
<BR>
Commercial, unflavored yogurt used for starter must be fresh<BR>
and contain live culture.<BR>
<BR>
Incubation temperature too high or too low.<BR>
<BR>
Temperature must be between 108 degrees F to 112 degrees F for<BR>
yogurt culture to<BR>
grow properly. Temperatures above 115 degrees F cause<BR>
separation or curdling and<BR>
can destroy the active yogurt culture, while temperatures below<BR>
100 degrees F stop<BR>
the growth.<BR>
<BR>
Interfering substances such as detergent.<BR>
<BR>
Wash and thoroughly rinse all yogurt-making equipment and<BR>
container(s) before<BR>
making yogurt.<BR>
<BR>
Off flavors:<BR>
<BR>
Off-flavored milk.<BR>
<BR>
Use fresh milk with a good flavor and fresh dry milk powder.<BR>
<BR>
Bacteria that cause off-flavors can grow along with the yogurt<BR>
culture.<BR>
<BR>
To prevent the presence of unwanted bacteria, use a fresh,<BR>
active yogurt culture (see<BR>
recipe for plain yogurt), thoroughly wash and rinse all<BR>
yogurt-making equipment and<BR>
container(s), hold container(s) in hot water while preparing<BR>
yogurt and keep container<BR>
covered during incubation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I also found this rather scientific explanation of yogurt making at the<BR>
following site http://www.engr.umd.edu/~nsw/ench485/lab8.htm<BR>
<BR>
Bests wishes for all!<BR>

Hi anna,<BR>
<BR>
I have a similar condition to yours and was disappointed at first to hear<BR>
from Ellaine, that this is hardest type of UC to treat with the diet. for<BR>
this reason I have decided to aim all guns at this problem. I am taking<BR>
(asulphadine) as salazopyrin. which is a form of 5-ASA with sulpha. also<BR>
cortisone enemas locally. I have wanted to steer clear of the cotisone<BR>
tablets and along with the diet and quite a few set backs, I 've just had<BR>
the first properly formed stools in about 4 months. I had very slow to no<BR>
results for the first 2 months on the diet. I've added some chinese<BR>
acumassage and some supplements. Then increased my calorie intake (see list<BR>
of high calorie vegetable) then I started making progress. the real<BR>
progress I found in the last week and a half when I cut out my meat protein<BR>
intake. on the suspicion that I had a 'carnivorous' bacterium since Elaine<BR>
spoke about those who don't respond to the diet as having a bacteria that<BR>
was &quot;not a big carbohydrate eater&quot;. I switched to a combination
of dried<BR>
Lima beans or red lentils every day for lunch and or dinner, mixed with<BR>
tahini to form a complete protein. I use this instead of meat. I still have<BR>
the yoghurt every day and also a good helping of the cottage cheese perhaps<BR>
for dinner (I like it plain with grated carrot and sultanas) the odd egg<BR>
boiled. Also I have nut bread or muffins now almost every day (I'm hooked)<BR>
these have egg.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps<BR>

Hello to the group<BR>
<BR>
Amanda: <BR>
About cramps in your legs.<BR>
<BR>
I have had cramps in my feet or legs so bad, always about the same time
in<BR>
very early hours approx. 3 - 5 in morning while in bed. They not only wake<BR>
me up but can be extremely painful, to the point of being sore and limping<BR>
on the leg durring the day. The last few years my hands have began cramping<BR>
as well while using small tools, or writing. I am remodelling my kitchen
so<BR>
you can get some idea of the type of work I am doing with my hands. <BR>
<BR>
I had been using Tums, for a number of years. Which are calcium carbonate
at<BR>
the rate of approx two every second day. And I will admit they seem to<BR>
improve my condition.But I am concerned about using the antacid tablet<BR>
because of my U.C.<BR>
<BR>
The is a Senior Citizens webb page I down loaded that suggests you should<BR>
use Quinane Sulphates. <BR>
<BR>
Just recently, last week in fact,I came across a article that sounds so<BR>
simple I thought it couldnt possiabley work. I have just started it the
last<BR>
five days, havent had a single cramp anywhere since I used it. Here it is.<BR>
Two tablespoons of vinegar (I used white) mixed with one tablespoon of honey,
into a cup or glass of warm water. It is so simple and it worked. So try
it and<BR>
let me know if it will help you. I have only taken the mixture the one time,<BR>
to date.<BR>
