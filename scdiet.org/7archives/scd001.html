          meals not at meals. Liquid at meal times dilutes the gastric acid. Avoid 
          meaty soups. If you do have them, eat the meat and the broth at different 
          meals.</P>

        <P><IMG SRC="../images/pil.gif" WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="7" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

          fully in acid in the stomach. The veges and the rest don't need the 
          acid and can sit like a blanket on top. Hence no 3.</P>

        <P><IMG SRC="../images/pil.gif" WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="7" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

          up and down, or moving around during the meal. Sit down, enjoy your 
          family and friends company for at least half an hour after the meal 
          this will aid digestion immeasurably.</P>

        <P><IMG SRC="../images/pil.gif" WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="7" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

          <B>separate</B> your meals. Have a meat and vege meal (no carbs) then 
          a carb meal (no meat) later</P>

        <P><IMG SRC="../images/pil.gif" WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="7" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P></P>

<P>The whole theory behind the Specific Carbohydrate Diet is to aim for
complete digestion before the food hits the large bowel. The body has a
better chance of digesting six half-size meals per day than three big ones.
In this way the acid can work to completion of a moderate portion of meat.
Also your pancreas and saliva can cope with secreting enough enzymes to
do the job.</P>

<B>Enzymes</B><BR>
Anna reported that Dr. Andrew Weill did not think digestive enzyme
supplements were worth much. In my research, I've found those that take
THERAPEUTIC DOSES of digestive enzymes to be either wildly enthusiastic with
their healing powers or "it's a waste of money...did nothing." The
naturopaths and doctors I interviewed all seemed to recommend them, and some
found they were useful for healing other things in the body (ie, clear the
mucus from asthmatic lungs, heal inflammation, sports injuries, etc.).
Different enzymes worked on various health problems...amylase for the mucus
problem, protease for inflammation and skin problems. <BR><BR>

Here is a great article about digestive enzymes..and from a digestive
disorder perspective...The Olde Crohn site....worth visiting regardless...<BR><BR>

Acidophilus bacteria are best taken first thing in the morning with water
and an empty stomach the water is to dilute the stomach acid to ensure they
get to where they are going unharmed. powder is better than capsules which
are better than tablets. tablets will not be as effective since many of the
bacteria are destoyed when processing the tablets. also tablets contain
binders of unknown composition that may or may not be harmful. powder is
the purest form of lactobacillus there is since the other forms are made
from the powder. you get more live cells for your money than with tablets
or capsules.<BR><BR>

<B>Fresh air</B><BR><BR>

With any affliction of the intestines, fresh air and activity (to get the
circulation going), are vital. This brings oxygen to the affected part
which enlivens the cells, kills anaerobic bacteria and helps regulate
pressure by means of stimulating regular peristalsis. Moderate (not power)
walking with sinulataneous deep breathing is the best form of exercise -
try it 15 mins in the morning and see how much better your days are!<BR><BR>

&gt;Hi all:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Does anyone have some suggestions as to which vegetables to introduce
<BR>
&gt;first?  I am at the moment stuck on peeled over-cooked zucchini.  I
<BR>
&gt;tried pureed butternut squash, but I am sure that it upset my stomach.
 <BR>
&gt;Broccoli killed me.  Any ideas?  Thanks.<BR>

Carrie,<BR>
I always found carrots to be the easiest veggie.  Peel them, chop them,
and<BR>
boil them till VERY soft.  Add butter, s &amp; p (if tolerable).  Chew well.
   If<BR>
you have problems with cooked veggies, try pureeing them in a food processor
or<BR>
blender and eat like baby food.  Keep experimenting.  Good luck!<BR>

<BR>
Carrots and Zuchini are the first to be introduced<BR>
<BR>
Then Pumpkin (well cooked - baked or soup or pressure cooked) other squash
and then cautiously add others.<BR>
<BR>
Avoid green veges raw or cooked until you can tolerate them. Take a vitamin
C supplement until you add more green veges.<BR>
<BR>
Stay mainly with fish chicken and a little lean pork<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Do not underestimate the power of the body to heal itself. Add to diet, some moderate exercise, 
eg walking or swimming and cycling. Do EVERYTHING you can to detox your 
body - herbal remedies, esp massage to the torso and legs and flush your 
kidneys with loads of water. If you don't have diarhea, make lightly 
steamed chinese green veges a part of your daily diet so as to counter a 
high acid level in the body. <BR>The greatest inhibition to the bodies healing 
process is a back log of waste in the body. This is your enemy to the 
instructions coded in your DNA. For every cell in your body contains 
information of how you bowel SHOULD look. Remove the obstacles and the body 
will correct itself. <BR>
        The bowels are essentially muscle tissue and as Arnold Schwazzenegger 
        will tell you, muscles can be trained and shaped. This is done through 
        fibre. Slippery Elm 4 times a day and Psyllium 2 The high protein content 
        of the diet will supply the body with the building blocks you need to 
        re-build you bowels.<BR>
<BR>
The worst thing for IBD is any packaged cereal and white or bogus 
&quot;wholemeal&quot;bread these products get caught in the intestines and
lodge 
themselves there for up to years, like cement where they ferment and 
putrify. What the IBD patient with a tender bowel needs is a diet high in 
water soluble fibre. Vegetables such as pumpkin and carrots and squash just 
slide through the system whilst also supplying a great deal of energy to 
the body.<BR>
<BR>
        Speak to Elaine about it as well.<BR>
<BR>

Stress has a large part to play in both these diseases.<BR>
<BR>
I tracked when my worst flares were over the years:<BR>
changing schools- grade 7- got the disease<BR>
business school and tons of work- really bad flare<BR>
working at a client at least 100 hours a week, under lots of pressure-<BR>
hospitalized<BR>
<BR>
My doctor recommends massage and relaxation therapy. I have started yoga<BR>
and medidating. It was hard at first because I am so hyper. My sister<BR>
who is more sedate does not have as much trouble with the disease.<BR>

Hi Shannon.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; This is particularly for UC people.  Dave was doing really well and then<BR>
&gt; on Friday his Mom died.  He isn't doing as well and now he has a sore<BR>
&gt; throat and fever.  Has this happened to anyone else under stress?<BR>
<BR>
I'm so sorry about Dave's Mom.<BR>
<BR>
It's a well known fact that stress does zap the immune system, and can also<BR>
aggravate any intestinal diseases (their is a definite brain - bowel<BR>
connection).  I would recommend he cut out all sugar (honey and fruit) and<BR>
take extra Vitamin C for a while...<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

<B>To Everyone with a bad flare:</B><BR>
<BR>
Besides this diet, REST is key to getting better.  Though you may not 
want 
to, or think you can't possibly miss work, you MUST take time off and 
rest 
if you want to get better.  Your body is telling<BR>
you something, and it is saying &quot;I need a rest!&quot;  Don't deny it, and try 
to 
force yourself to carry on with your regular duties.  Get help from 
families, friends, neighbors, parents, etc.  It is well worth it in the 
end.<BR>
It took me a long time to learn this, but once I did, I realized that 
REST 
makes all the difference in the world when trying to heal.  You can 
always 
get caught up later, when you are WELL and have the energy.<BR>

Dear Mark {mpetee},<BR><BR>

Besides this list for support I have been working on becoming more self reliant
by reading and actively putting effort into healing myself. Adhering to SCD way
of eating and the practice of yoga is part of  the attitude change that is
helping me.<BR>
I read a description recently about healing ourselves and how relevant our
personal efforts affect our life.<BR>
Hope this helps renew your commitment to healing yourself .<BR><BR>

<B>Yogic Cure For Common Diseases</B><I><BR>
By Dr. Phulgenda Sinha</I><BR><BR>

In any medical system the primary reliance is on medicine.  It is assumed that
a particular medicine will cure a particular disease.  The medical doctor does
the diagnosis, identifies the disease and prescribes a suitable medicine.  The
patient in this system has to do very little or nothing at all.   The task of
correcting the disease and disorder and restoring health is assigned to the
medicine.<BR><BR>

Seen in this context, there is a contrast between the medical system and the
yogic (or in our case SCD) system of treatment.  Whereas in the medical system
an external agent (medicine) does the corrective work, in the yogic (SCD)
system you are responsible for this work. Eventually this external agent is not
needed at all. It is the patient himself whose personal understanding, practice
and care cures his disease in the yogic (SCD) system.<BR><BR>

Many Patients who encountered suffering from chronic disease have lost faith in
the medical system because in spite of years of treatment they had not achieved
permanent and satisfactory cure.  In certain cases the medicine provided them
immediate relief, but not a lasting cure.  On the other hand a great number of
patients achieved permanent cure through therapeutic yoga(SCD).<BR><BR>

This limitation of the medical system should not mean that it is inferior to
the yoga system; rather it is only a matter of the limitation and scope of a
given system of healing. There are areas where only medical science and not
yoga can come to the rescue of the patient. Similarly there are certain
disease, which though regarded incurable through medical systems are definitely
cured through yoga (SCD).  This shows that every system of treatment has
certain unique points and limitations.<BR><BR>

Take care of yourself.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR>Hi all,<BR>
Just picked up a new book and the first page I turned to really spoke to 
me concerning the unbelievable changes that have occurred in my life 
since committing myself to the SCD. Thought I'd share this with you.<BR>
<P><TT>
Until one is committed<BR>
There is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness<BR>
Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one element 
of truth<BR>
The ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans:<BR>
That the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves 
too.<BR>
All sorts of things occur to help one that would never have otherwise 
occurred<BR>
A whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in one's 
favour all<BR>
Manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance 
which<BR>
No man could have dreamed would have come his way.<BR>
Whatever you do, or dream you can, begin it.<BR>
Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.<BR>
Begin it now.<BR></TT>
