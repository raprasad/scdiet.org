More on worms, with an SCD-friendly twist at the end...<BR>
Wonderful worms<BR>
(New Scientist article)<BR>
Andy Coghlan<BR><BR>
REGULAR DOSES OF WORMS might rid people of inflammatory bowel disease,
say researchers in Iowa.  They believe this distressing condition,
which is increasingly common in the developed world, is caused by the
absence of intestinal parasites.  &quot;We're living in sterile boxes,
breathing sterile air and drinking sterile water,&quot; says Joel
Weinstock, who led the research.<BR><BR>
Weinstock and his colleagues at the University of Iowa have already
fed six sufferers eggs that hatched and developed into parasitic
worms.  The results were so dramatic that they are planning a larger
trial this autumn.  Between the second and third week after treatment,
five of the six patients went into complete remission,&quot; says
Weinstock.  A single dose of worms eased symptoms for about a month.<BR><BR>
Inflammatory bowel disease--an umbrella term for ulcerative colitis
and Crohn's disease--appears to be caused by an overactive immune
system.  Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bowel obstruction
and bleeding.<BR><BR>
Weinstock noticed that the rise in inflammatory bowel disease was
preceded by a decline in intestinal worm infections.  Seventy years
ago, he says, 40 per cent of American children had worms such as
Ascaris lumbricoides, which grow up to 20 centimetres long.  As
recently as the 1940s, many were infected with smaller whipworms
(Trichuris trichuria).  &quot;By the 1960s, kids no longer had it,&quot; says
Weinstock.<BR><BR>
&quot;The worms living in the gastrointestinal tract have been with us for
3 million years or longer,&quot; he says. &quot;Our immune systems have grown
used to their presence.&quot;  And without such parasites, Weinstock
believes the immune system is more likely to produce powerful
inflammatory agents such as gamma-interferon, which fire up the
activity of white blood cells called macrophages.  &quot;As we've
de-wormed, people have developed immune systems which are not damped,&quot;
he says.<BR><BR>
The six patients in the initial trial were chosen because steroids and
other drugs designed to dampen down the immune system had not helped. 
Working with his colleagues David Elliott and Robert Summers,
Weinstock gave each patient a drink containing microscopic eggs of a
species of intestinal worm that doesn't normally infect people. 
Although these worms can survive in the human gut, growing to about 1
centimetre, they cannot reproduce and are eliminated after a couple of
months.<BR><BR>
Balfour Sartor, an expert on inflammatory bowel disease at the
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, is intrigued by
Weinstock's experiment.  &quot;It's an appealing way of using something
that's of fairly low toxicity to treat a set of diseases that for now
we don't have a cure for,&quot; he says.  Sartor is himself experimenting
with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium gut bacteria, again with the
idea that they may have dampening effects on the immune system.<BR><BR>
However, there is still a long way to go before doses of worms or
bacteria emerge as an accepted treatment for inflammatory bowel
disease.  Larger controlled trials are needed to show that the results
obtained so far aren't merely due to the placebo effect.<BR><BR>

of Nutrition & Dietetics, 1999, no 84, page 19-73, and in the book 
'Evolutionary Aspects of Nutrition and Health -

The book is a compilation of articles showing
how humanity's genetic makeup has been directly influenced by 
nutritional selective pressures and how our present day diet may be
discordant with our stone age genome. 
The book is rather expensive and very technical and scientific in its language, 
but the description on the page is worth reading.<BR>

Here's a roundup of what CCFA is featuring on their site,

<BR>
* CLINICAL TRIAL ALERT: An ongoing clinical trial is enrolling
patients to
test an experimental drug as a treatment for Crohn's disease. The drug is
called ISIS 2302. It is being developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals, a
biotechnology company pioneering in a new area of drug discovery called
antisense-technology.  ISIS 2302 works through an antisense mechanism. This
drug works at the genetic level to inhibit the production of proteins that
plays a role in Crohn's, as well as other inflammatory diseases.  That
protein is called ICAM-1. More information can be found at:<BR>

* THE 1999 CCFA RESEARCH REPORT: A researcher once said that studying
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is &quot;like looking for a needle in a
haystack.&quot; Actually, it's more like looking for several needles, in
haystacks of all shapes and sizes. But, we have made great strides in the
past decade. A hypothesis is forming to explain inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). Check out this story at:<BR>

Subject: <B>Crohn's Disease on Increase</B><BR>
<P>The results of a retrospective study of the incidence of 
paediatric IBD over an 11 year period have recently been made public. 
<BR>The research taken at the University Hospital of 
Wales in Cardiff, revealed that the incidence of Crohn's 
disease more than doubled from 1.3 cases per 100,000 
childhood population per year in the period 1983-1988, to 
3.11 cases per 100,000 population per year in the year 
1989-1993. In contrast, the incidence of UC remained the same 
throughout the study period at 0.71 per 100,000 per year. 
Results from an English study in 1983 showed similar trends.
<P>These findings are in direct contract to figures published 
in mid-80s on children in Scandinavia. The annual incidence of 
crohns disease was only 2.5 per 100,000 per year, but the 
incidence of UC was much greater than 4.3 per 100,000 per 
year. In Norway and Sweden, the incidence of UC was greater 
than that of CD. The reasons for such a variation in the 
incidence of CD in some areas is unknown.
<P>In 1993, the prevalence of CD in the childhood population of 
Wales was 16.6 per 100,000 and of UC, 3.42 per 100,000.
<P>How interesting!

Subject: <B>Infectious Microbes Under Suspicion</B><BR>
<P>On the front page of the <A HREF="http://www.iht.com/">International Herald Tribune</A>, 
Tuesday, March 2, 1999,
an article titled &quot;Can a Person 'Catch' Heart Disease? Maybe -- Infectious
Microbes Under Suspicion&quot; states that a growing number of scientists believe
that many illnesses long presumed to have roots in genes or lifestyle might be
caused largely by infectious agents. <BR>
The article describes new research developments concerning heart disease, but the
news, I think, could be interesting for people with other chronic diseases as
well - like Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis.<BR>
As stated in the article:<BR>
&quot;That prospect is raising the intriguing possibility that people can
&quot;catch&quot; kidney stones, cerebral palsy, Alzheimer's disease.&quot;<BR>
Some quotes from the article:<BR>
&quot;Researchers announced last week that they had discovered a molecular
mechanism by which mice can get heart disease from a bacterium. <BR>
And high-tech tests have been picking up previously undetectable bacterial
&quot;fingerprints&quot; in people with other chronic conditions, strengthening the case
that microbes are the hidden perpetrators.<BR>
The implications of the new theory are enormous, researchers say. Most important,
it suggests that vaccines or antibiotics might have an unexpectedly big role to
play in the treatment of chronic diseases that today are treated with only modest
success through lifestyle changes, such as exercise and improved diet.&quot;<BR>
&quot;The revolution began about five years ago, when definitive evidence arose
that stomach ulcers are caused not by excess stomach acid, as had long been
presumed, but by the bacterium Helicobacter Pylori. It was not easy persuading
the scientific community to accept the new model.<BR>
Barry Marshall, an Australian scientist with a flair for theatrics, resorted to
swallowing a beaker of the bacteria to help settle the question. Today, ulcers
are treated primarily with antibiotics instead of acid-blocking drugs.&quot;<BR>

<BR>Subject: <B>Fiber, Sugar and the Risk of Colorectal Cancer</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Hi everyone in the group,
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>I came across an article, &quot;Dietary Fiber and the Risk of Colorectal Cancer
 and Adenoma in Women&quot;, in the last issue of The New England Journal of
 Medicine (January 21, 1999, Volume 340, Number 3) which I find interesting
 in regard to Gottshall's and Lutz's findings of the many negative effects
 sugar has on our bodies. 
<BR>
<BR>
 This is a quote from the editorial of the issue which is entitled &quot;Fiber
 and Colorectal Cancer -- Where to Now?&quot;:
 &quot;Is it really a surfeit of sugar, not an absence of fiber, that causes the
 risk of colorectal cancer to increase? Somewhat ignored, sugar consumption
 is consistently associated with the risk of colorectal cancer, and in a
 dose-response fashion. 
 Perhaps a high intake of calories, aberrant responses to carbohydrates,
 and a lack of physical activity are also relevant.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
 This being said in regard to cancer, not to colitis. 
 However, concerning sugar as well as physical activity, these new findings
 are - as far as I can see - confirming why we SCD'ers are on the right
 track.
<BR>
<BR>
 In Denmark, results of another survey were published recently, stating
 that scientists now have evidence that four hours of exercise a week
 (approx. half an hour a day) has a significant effect on the healing
 process for patients with colon cancer.
<BR>

Linda, <BR>
The best medical overview of Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis I have<BR>
found is Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis by Dr. Fred Saibil. It is an<BR>
excellent reference of what the diseases are and what treatments are<BR>
available. However, he does not deal with the SCD diet or alternative<BR>
medicines at all. The book can be bought at Amazon.com. There are also<BR>
plenty of reviews there to judge for yourself.<BR>

<BR>
I thought some people might be interested in a recent review article that<BR>
I've found.  So far I have only read the abstract, but I will be getting<BR>
the article to read soon.<BR>
The reference is:  Nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease. <BR>
     Inflamm Bowel Dis. 1998 Feb;4(1):45-53. Review. <BR>
<BR>
Here is a copy of the abstract:<BR>
&quot;The value of nutritional support in the prevention and treatment of<BR>
malnutrition in Crohn's disease is undisputed but its role in<BR>
primary therapy continues to be debated. Controlled trials have<BR>
demonstrated that enteral nutrition induces remission rates<BR>
comparable to that of corticosteroid therapy in Crohn's disease and remains<BR>
the treatment of choice for specific subgroups such<BR>
as children with signs of growth impairment and patients with intolerable<BR>
steroid-induced side effects. The mechanism by which<BR>
an enteral diet induces remission in Crohn's disease is unclear. Bowel<BR>
rest, reduced antigenic load, nutritional effects, the<BR>
provision of trophic amino acids, modification of gut flora, intestinal<BR>
permeability, or fecal pH have been proposed. Equally, the<BR>
fat profile of the feed may reduce pro-inflammatory ecosanoid synthesis and<BR>
thus modify disease activity. Maintaining long-term<BR>
remission remains a challenge in the management of this disease. Cyclic<BR>
administration of enteral diets, maintenance drug<BR>
therapy, fat manipulated formulas, or fish oil therapy may be strategies to<BR>
prolong diet-induced remission. In the future, nutrient<BR>
derivatives that play a role in the protective processes of the intestinal<BR>
mucosa may have application in nutritional therapy in<BR>
Crohn's disease. &quot;<BR>

I will try to clear up the issue of what exactly the people in the study on<BR>
diet and Crohn's were eating when I get my hands on the actutal article.<BR>
Unfortunately, the library at the University here does not carry it, so I<BR>
will have to do some looking around.<BR>
The thing I found most significant about the abstract was the statement<BR>
that these type of diets might work because of their effect on gut flora.<BR>
Since this is what we are doing with our diet, I thought it was important<BR>
that a study out there actually recognized that fact.<BR>

Scientists isolate immune system 'on/off switch'<BR>
<BR>
 By Jonathan Birt LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Scientists have isolated a<BR>
gene<BR>
which they believe acts as an on/off switch for the body's<BR>
immune system, promising new ways of treating conditions ranging<BR>
from cancer to Crohn's Disease, the British company behind the<BR>
breakthrough said on Tuesday.<BR>
            Researchers at the U.S. arm of Chiroscience Group Plc are<BR>
also close to locating a second gene which could reverse bone<BR>
wasting caused by osteoporosis, a condition which affects<BR>
millions of people over 60 and leads to more than one million<BR>
fractures in the U.S. every year.<BR>
            Research and Development Director Robert Jackson said<BR>
uncovering the gene which regulates the body's immune response<BR>
could one day lead to development of a whole new range of drugs.<BR>
         ''Sometimes you want to turn it off and sometimes you want to<BR>
turn it on,'' Jackson told Reuters.<BR>
            Turning the immune system on or up could help in conditions<BR>
like AIDS and cancer, where the body's efforts to fight off<BR>
tumours are currently too weak.<BR>
            ''If we could strengthen that, we could develop drugs to<BR>
help the body react to tumours,'' Jackson said.<BR>
            But switching it off or down might be useful in a range of<BR>
diseases caused by an overly fierce immune response -- such as<BR>
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, Crohn's Disease,<BR>
ulcerative colitis and allergy.<BR>
            Gene-based research at the former Darwin Molecular<BR>
business<BR>
in Seattle, Washington, which Chiroscience bought in 1996, is<BR>
also close to locating a mutant gene which may offer a way of<BR>
reversing the effects of osteoporosis for the first time.<BR>
            Scientists are studying around 100 people and their<BR>
families<BR>
in South Africa with extremely strong bones caused by a mutant<BR>
gene which causes bone density to increase as people age -- the<BR>
exact opposite of osteoporosis.<BR>
            ''We are close to identifying a unique bone structure gene<BR>
for osteoporosis,'' Chief Executive Officer John Padfield told<BR>
Reuters.<BR>
            ''All other treatments try to stop bone loss getting<BR>
worse.<BR>
What our gene appears to do is increase bone density very<BR>
substantially -- if this turns out to be true when we test a<BR>
drug, that would be a revolutionary treatment for<BR>
osteoporosis.''<BR>
            The company announced the discoveries as part of a<BR>
day-long<BR>
update on its research and development activities. Shares in<BR>
Chiroscience were up seven percent or 17 1/2 pence in early<BR>
afternoon trading in London.<BR>
            Chiroscience said it will also work with the small British<BR>
genome company Gemini Research, which has built up a database of<BR>
genetic information based on identical twins. The two companies<BR>
are to look for mutant genes linked to obesity.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Crohn's Disease Drug Approved</B><BR>
About 400,000 Americans have Crohn's disease, a severe gastrointestinal<BR>
tract inflammation that causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and<BR>
weight loss. <BR>
The Associated Press<BR>
W A S H I N G T O N, Aug. 24 - The Food and Drug Administration today<BR>
approved a revolutionary treatment for the debilitating bowel disorder<BR>
Crohn's disease: A biologically engineered antibody that attacks a<BR>
protein responsible for much of patients' misery. <BR>
Centocor Inc.'s infliximab is a part-human, part-mouse antibody, to be<BR>
sold under the brand name Remicade. <BR>
About 400,000 Americans have Crohn's disease, a severe gastrointestinal<BR>
tract inflammation that causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and<BR>
weight loss. In severe cases, patients develop intestinal blockages and<BR>
ulcer-like channels called fistulas that burrow through the bowel wall. <BR>
It mostly strikes women, usually between ages 20 and 35. There is no<BR>
cure. Most patients are treated with steroids to reduce the<BR>
inflammation; some require repeat surgeries to remove damaged parts of<BR>
the intestine. <BR>
Remicade is a monoclonal antibody, a biologically engineered drug that<BR>
sweeps through the body hunting down and neutralizing tumor necrosis<BR>
factor, a protein that causes much of the intestinal inflammation. <BR>
In a study of 108 moderate to severe Crohn's patients, 82 percent who<BR>
received an injection of Remicade improved, including 48 percent who<BR>
went into remission. That compares with 16 percent of patients who<BR>
improved while taking a placebo. <BR>
Heals Fistula Sores <BR>
In the worst-case patients, Centocor says Remicade is the first medicine<BR>
documented to heal open fistulas: 68 percent had at least half of their<BR>
ulcer-like sores close during therapy, vs. 26 percent of patients who<BR>
received dummy injections. <BR>
But the benefits wear off: patients benefited most within the two to<BR>
four weeks after a single dose, the government said, and the percentage<BR>
of patients who saw benefits then fell over the next few months. <BR>
As part of the drug's approval, Centocor agreed to study whether the<BR>
drug also works over a longer time period, and whether it is safe for<BR>
long-term use, the government said. <BR>
Side effects included hives, shortness of breath or reduction of blood<BR>
pressure during the drug's infusion. Patients also may suffer nausea,<BR>
fatigue and infection, the company warned. <BR>
Centocor says pharmacies should have supplies of Remicade in early<BR>
October. A price was not immediately announced. Patients may also know<BR>
the drug as Avakine, the name Centocor first used when testing it.  <BR>

Isis Crohn's Disease Drug Shows Evidence of Durable Remission,<BR>
Steroid-Sparing And Fistula Healing Effects<BR>
<BR>
Results of Phase II Trial Show Inhibition of ICAM-1 and Other<BR>
Inflammatory Markers,<BR>
Supporting Antisense Mechanism<BR>
<BR>
CARLSBAD, Calif., June 10 /PRNewswire/ -- In the June 1998 issue of<BR>
Gastroenterology, Isis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:<BR>
ISIP - news) and Crohn's disease academic researchers report on the<BR>
results of a well-controlled 20-patient Phase II trial of<BR>
ISIS 2302 in the treatment of Crohn's disease. These results show a<BR>
statistically significant lowering of steroid requirements<BR>
(p=0.0001) in ISIS 2302-treated patients, and show that by the end of<BR>
the one month treatment period, ISIS 2302 produced<BR>
disease remission (Crohn's Disease Activity Index &lt;150) in 47% of<BR>
patients treated with the drug. The mean duration of<BR>
remission was prolonged; at the end of the 6-month trial, 5 of the 7<BR>
ISIS 2302-treated remitters were still in remission following<BR>
a single course of treatment. In addition, at the end of 6 months,<BR>
corticosteroid treatment was completely discontinued in 33%<BR>
(5 of 15) of the ISIS 2302 treated patients and in no placebo patients.<BR>
Long-term steroid use can cause severe side effects<BR>
including osteoporosis, immune suppression and endocrinological changes.<BR>
<BR>
This publication includes data on the 20-patient, double-blinded,<BR>
placebo- controlled, randomized (3:1; ISIS 2302: placebo)<BR>
Phase II trial which were previously presented at two scientific<BR>
conferences, as well as data supporting that ISIS 2302 is<BR>
working through an antisense mechanism.<BR>
<BR>
The publication is entitled, ''A Placebo-Controlled Trial of an ICAM-1<BR>
Antisense Oligonucleotide in the Treatment of Crohn's<BR>
Disease.'' The authors are Bruce R. Yacyshyn, M.D., Mary Beth<BR>
Bowen-Yacyshyn, Ph.D., Lawrence Jewell, M.D., of the<BR>
Department of Gastroenterology, University of Alberta, Edmonton; Joseph<BR>
A. Tami, Pharm.D., C. Frank Bennett, Ph.D.,<BR>
Daniel L. Kisner, M.D., and William R. Shanahan, Jr., M.D., of Isis<BR>
Pharmaceuticals.<BR>
<BR>
ISIS 2302 is an antisense inhibitor of intercellular adhesion molecule<BR>
-1 (ICAM-1), a cell adhesion molecule implicated in a<BR>
wide range of inflammatory diseases and conditions. The drug is a key<BR>
asset in the cell adhesion collaboration between Isis and<BR>
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH. A 300-patient pivotal quality trial of ISIS<BR>
2302 in patients with steroid- dependent Crohn's<BR>
disease is underway in North America and Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Fistulae Healing<BR>
<BR>
Two patients who had an open fistula when they entered the study and<BR>
were treated with ISIS 2302 experienced healing of<BR>
their fistula. Fistulae are open channels from the bowel to the skin and<BR>
other organs through which fecal matter can drain,<BR>
causing soiling, pain and infection. In addition, both patients in this<BR>
study with gastroduodenal Crohn's disease (located where<BR>
the stomach meets the intestine) were treated with ISIS 2302, and both<BR>
experienced resolution of upper gastrointestinal<BR>
obstructive symptoms during the course of treatment. These two patients<BR>
remain free of their obstructive symptoms after over<BR>
one year following treatment with ISIS 2302.<BR>
<BR>
''The ability of ISIS 2302 to produce durable remissions in patients<BR>
with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease, to heal fistulae<BR>
and to reduce and, in many patients, eliminate steroid use, strongly<BR>
suggests that ISIS 2302 can be an important treatment for<BR>
Crohn's disease,'' said Bruce R. Yacyshyn, M.D., Division of<BR>
Gastroenterology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, and lead<BR>
author on the paper.<BR>
<BR>
Antisense Mechanism Supported<BR>
<BR>
Newly released findings reported in the Gastroenterology article suggest<BR>
a strong correlation between treatment with ISIS<BR>
2302, reduction in ICAM-1 expression in affected bowel tissue and<BR>
apparent release of proinflammatory lymphocytes from the<BR>
gut. In the intestinal mucosa of patients treated with ISIS 2302,<BR>
decreases in ICAM-1 expression (CD54) were seen in<BR>
significantly more of the ISIS 2302-treated patients than<BR>
placebo-treated patients, and higher doses of ISIS 2302 produced<BR>
greater effects. In addition, an increase in peripheral blood T-cells<BR>
bearing the adhesion molecules alpha-d and beta-7, which<BR>
are involved in lymphocyte homing to the intestine, was observed. The<BR>
correlation of ICAM-1 inhibition and the apparent<BR>
release of immune cells from the intestine suggest that suppression of<BR>
ICAM-1 results in an interruption of the immune cell<BR>
intestinal trafficking and retention that are critical to the<BR>
perpetuation of the inflammatory disease process. This interruption may<BR>
allow restoration of normal bowel mucosal integrity and immune function,<BR>
thereby resulting in prolonged disease suppression.<BR>
<BR>
''In patients treated with ISIS 2302, the changes observed in peripheral<BR>
blood lymphocyte and intestinal mucosal expression of<BR>
adhesion molecules strongly suggest a therapeutic effect with ISIS 2302<BR>
achieved through an antisense mechanism of action.<BR>
These data provide the first evidence of an interplay in inflammatory<BR>
disease between specific cell adhesion molecules, with<BR>
potential implications for designing antiinflammatory drugs in the<BR>
future,'' said Dr. Yacyshyn.<BR>
<BR>

Anti-Milk Group Exposes Claim That Normal Pasteurization Kills<BR>
Dangerous Bacterium in Milk <BR>
<BR>
Tuesday, July 14 9:07 AM ET<BR>
<BR>
AntiDairy Coalition Faults FDA and USDA for Misinterpreting Scientific<BR>
Study<BR>
<BR>
NEW YORK (BUSINESS WIRE) - The AntiDairy Coalition has denounced a<BR>
claim, based on a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) study,<BR>
that normal pasteurization practiced by dairy producers nationwide<BR>
inactivates a dangerous bacterium routinely found in raw milk.<BR>
<BR>
In his weekly AntiDairy Coalition Newsletter column on the Internet,<BR>
Coalition executive director Robert Cohen says the USDA study, which<BR>
was reported in the May 10, 1998 issue of Hoard's Dairyman, a trade<BR>
publication, has been completely misrepresented by the agency and by<BR>
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in claiming that normal<BR>
pasteurization (72 degrees centigrade for 15 seconds) destroys<BR>
mycobacterium paratuberculosis, the bacterium linked to Johne's<BR>
disease in cows and Crohn's disease in humans that produces persistent<BR>
and severe diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
Cohen, author of &quot;Milk - the Deadly Poison,&quot; says that the USDA study<BR>
actually revealed that the dangerous bacteria were not totally<BR>
inactivated until after 15 minutes of pasteurization at 72 degrees<BR>
centigrade.<BR>
<BR>
That's &quot;very bad news for all milk drinkers,&quot; says Cohen. &quot;Normal<BR>
pasteurization at this temperature calls for only a 15-second<BR>
treatment, not 15 minutes. We believe the government and Hoard's<BR>
Dairyman are misleading the public into thinking pasteurized milk is<BR>
safe from mycobacterium paratuberculosis when the USDA's own scientist<BR>
is saying that pasteurization inactivates the bacterium only when the<BR>
process maintains at least 72 degrees centigrade for at least 15<BR>
minutes. That's 14 minutes and 45 seconds longer than the normal<BR>
commercial pasteurization of milk in the United States.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The USDA study is entitled &quot;Heat Inactivation of Mycobacterium<BR>
paratuberculosis in Raw Milk: Are Current Pasteurization Conditions<BR>
Effective?&quot; Based on this study, Hoard's Dairyman told its<BR>
100,000-plus milk producer subscribers, &quot;Heat treatment<BR>
(pasteurization) destroys this dangerous disease.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Cohen says the FDA supports the same conclusion. He refers to a letter<BR>
addressed to government officials from Joseph Smucker, team leader of<BR>
the Milk and Safety Team at the Center for Food Safety and Applied<BR>
Nutrition, a branch of the FDA. The letter says: &quot;After a review of<BR>
the available literature on the subject, it is the position of FDA<BR>
that the latest research shows conclusively that commercial<BR>
pasteurization does indeed eliminate this hazard.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Cohen says every assertion about pasteurization's effectiveness is<BR>
refuted in the abstract of the USDA study, which states: &quot;Currently,<BR>
it is not known whether commercial pasteurization effectively kills<BR>
mycobacterium paratuberculosis in contaminated raw milk.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This sentence,&quot; Cohen says, &quot;contradicts every conclusion made from<BR>
this very same paper!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The senior author of the abstract is Judy Stabel, Ph.D. On the second<BR>
page of Dr. Stabel's paper (published in the December 1997 issue of<BR>
Applied and Environmental Microbiology), she reveals: &quot;Bacteria were<BR>
not totally inactivated until after 15 minutes of incubation<BR>
(pasteurization) at 72 degrees centigrade.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In her paper, Dr. Stabel also writes: &quot;There is no definitive evidence<BR>
to date that viable M. paratuberculosis is present in retail<BR>
pasteurized dairy products.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When she was asked why there was no evidence and if milk samples had<BR>
ever been tested at retail sites, Cohen says her response was &quot;No.&quot;<BR>
When asked &quot;Why not?&quot; she replied, &quot;I don't know.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
However, Cohen contends that British scientists have taken milk<BR>
samples at the point of retail purchase and have cultured live<BR>
tuberculosis bacteria from these samples.<BR>
<BR>
Cohen concludes that the FDA and USDA have misinterpreted Dr. Stabel's<BR>
paper, and scientific evidence suggests that this dangerous bacterium<BR>
survives pasteurization. &quot;This is just another example of how<BR>
Americans are being betrayed by regulatory agencies like FDA and<BR>
USDA,&quot; Cohen warns.<BR>

Subject: <B>diet linked to colon cancer</B><BR>
<BR>
Monday July 13 6:23 PM EDT<BR>
<BR>
Western diet linked to colon cancer risk<BR>
<BR>
NEW YORK, Jul 13 (Reuters) -- Diets rich in meat and low in fruits and<BR>
vegetables may increase the risk of colon cancer,<BR>
concludes a report.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The dietary pattern associated with the greatest increase in risk is<BR>
the one which typifies a Western-style diet,&quot; say researchers<BR>
led by Dr. Martha Slattery of the University of Utah Medical Center in<BR>
Salt Lake City.<BR>
<BR>
According to the American Cancer Society, colon cancer kills over 46,000<BR>
people every year in the United States, making it<BR>
the country's second leading cause of cancer death, after lung cancer.<BR>
Experts have long speculated that certain foods and diets<BR>
may influence colon cancer risk.<BR>
<BR>
In their study, published in the current issue of the American Journal<BR>
of Epidemiology, the investigators used detailed<BR>
questionnaires to ascertain the long-term eating patterns of nearly<BR>
4,400 American adults. Half of those interviewed were colon<BR>
cancer patients, while the other half were healthy &quot;controls.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Men and women who ate what the researchers labeled a &quot;Western&quot; diet --<BR>
high in red and processed meats, refined grains and<BR>
sugars, and low in fresh fruits and vegetables -- doubled their overall<BR>
risk for colon cancer. This type of diet was also strongly<BR>
associated with higher daily cholesterol and energy intake, weight gain,<BR>
and obesity.<BR>
<BR>
In contrast, individuals who stuck to what the researchers labeled a<BR>
&quot;prudent&quot; diet -- low in red meat and sugars but high in<BR>
fish, poultry, fresh fruits and vegetables -- achieved a nearly 40%<BR>
reduction in their colon cancer risk. These individuals also<BR>
exercised more and had an average lower body weight than those on more<BR>
&quot;Western&quot; diets.<BR>
<BR>
A third type of diet, where individuals substituted whole grains for<BR>
processed grains, poultry for red meat, and margarine for<BR>
butter, provided about a 15% reduction in risk, but statistical analysis<BR>
shows that this difference may have occurred by chance.<BR>
The researchers point out that these 'substituters,' &quot;while adopting<BR>
many healthy eating patterns, did not include vegetables as<BR>
part of their dietary pattern and (therefore) did not experience the<BR>
reduced risk of colon cancer observed in those with the<BR>
prudent diet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Slattery and her colleagues believe the study &quot;lends further support to<BR>
the commonly held belief that a Western-style diet<BR>
contributes to colon cancer risk and that a prudent diet, one enriched<BR>
with vegetables, refined grains, fruits, fish, and poultry,<BR>
may help prevent colon cancer.&quot; SOURCE: American Journal of Epidemiology<BR>

and I have permission to distribute it to people on this group. If
anybody would like a copy, please send me an email. I could post the
whole thing, but it's about seven pages long so I wouldn't want to waste
space if only a few people are interested.
<BR><BR>
Here's an introduction to the article:
<BR><BR>
&quot;With the advent of biochemical and microbial stool
analysis panels, an increasing number of physicians are
seeking a clearer understanding of the relationship between
the ecology of the digestive tract and local and systemic
factors affecting health and disease.  It can be described as
being due to either putrefaction, fermentation, deficiency, or
sensitization.  A number of inflammatory diseases within the
bowel or involving skin and connective tissue have been
reported in association with dysbiosis.  This article details
the relationships, causes, and treatment options for
dysbiotic-related conditions.&quot;

Here is an excellant article on reactive bowel disease and diet.  There
are a few references in it that back up Elaine's hypothesis for the
elimination of dairy and cereal grains.  For example:<BR><BR>

&quot;In a study by V. Alum Jones et al, 67% of patients with IBS improved
after one week on a strict diet. The GIT disturbance was related to
increased levels of Prostaglandin E2 and not related to IgE-mediated
hypersensitivity. Nanda et al implicated dairy products and cereal
grains in IBS; almost half of the 200 patients were treated with diet
revision, and almost half improved. Pagenelli showed similar improvement
on a restricted diet and increased GIT permeability to
beta-lactoglobulin was demonstrated in 3 patients using serum
measurements with a sensitive immunoradiometric assay after milk
challenge.  Circulating immune complexes after challenge with milk were
demonstrated in 9 of 13 patients before diet revision. The addition of
cromolyn sodium ( Nalcrom), a mast-cell stabilizing agent, improved
symptom remission in some patients.&quot;<BR><BR>

<B>Question</B><BR>
Mon,  7 Jul 1997  9:34:03 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I found an article on &quot;Current Medical Therapy for Inflamatory Bowel<BR>
Disease&quot; on the net lately<BR>
(Full text under: <A
HREF="http://www.sma.org/smj/96jun2.htm">http://www.sma.org/smj/96jun2.htm</A>).<BR>
<BR>
Especially the part on &quot;Short-Chain Fatty Acids&quot; (see below) aroused
my<BR>
interest. Does anyone of you know a brand name of such a medicament?<BR>
Pharmacists and doctors here haven`t heard of it at all.<BR>
<BR>
Miroslav<BR>
Germany<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;Short-Chain Fatty Acids</B><BR>
<BR>
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, are the preferred<BR>
energy substrate for distal colonic epithelial cells. Decreased fecal<BR>
concentrations of SCFA have been shown to occur in patients with<BR>
ulcerative colitis but not Crohn's colitis. Table 3 summarizes clinical<BR>
studies on the use of SCFA enemas for active distal ulcerative colitis.<BR>
The clinical response rates of 56% to 90% are slightly lower than those<BR>
reported for hydrocortison or mesalamine enemas. The uniqueness of SCFA<BR>
therapy is that the presumed mechanism of action is feeding the colon<BR>
rather than altering its immune response. SCFA therapy given<BR>
concurrently with other agents might offer even more promise. In fact,<BR>
one small uncontrolled trial reported a 100% response rate using a<BR>
combination SCFA/5-ASA enema therapy in patients with previously<BR>
refractory distal ulcerative colitis.&quot;<BR>

Hi, Miroslav.  I've been trying to find out about this, too, without much<BR>
success (haven't had too much time).  I also came across a paper that said<BR>
they were studying aloe vera for SFA's.  SFA's (like butyric acid) are also<BR>
produced in a normally-functioning bowel from enzymes working on fibre.<BR>

I am using Medline as often as possible and did find another interesting

<I>Klin. Wschr. 54, 367-371 1976.</I><BR>
<BR>
Conclutions from reading:<BR>
<BR>
There was an significant difference in intake of refined suger between 63<BR>
patients and a control group of 63: 482 gram/week against 285 gram/week.<BR>
Before the disease was recognized the patients consumed even greater amount:<BR>
742 gram/week!!<BR>
<BR>
Martini and Brandes suggests that: &quot;It is possible that the increased<BR>
consumtion of suger for many years may lead lead to changes in the<BR>
intestinal bacterial flora and general milieu in such a way that the mucosa<BR>
may be damaged...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This trial from 1976 (!) has certainly been IGNORED by school medicine.<BR>

    Dietary habits as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease.<BR><BR>

by Tragnone A, Valpiani D, Miglio F, Elmi G, Bazzocchi G, Pipitone E,
                            Lanfranchi GA<BR><BR>

   Division of Internal Medicine, Bellaria Hospital, University of
                           Bologna, Italy.<BR><BR>

   OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of dietary factors in Italian
   patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. <BR>DESIGN: We
   studied dietary habits immediately prior to the onset of disease in
    104
   patients enrolled in a prospective, epidemiological study of the
   incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in Italy. <BR>METHODS: Each
   patient was interviewed using a recall questionnaire to provide
   information
   on the daily intake of nutrients. The differences in diet between
   patients and healthy subjects matched for age, sex and city of
   residence were determined. <BR>RESULTS: Our data confirm that patients
   with
   Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have a high intake of total
   carbohydrate, starch and refined sugar. This resulted in a
   significantly higher relative risk (P &lt; 0.001) in both ulcerative
   colitis and Crohn's
   disease patients. Total protein intake was significantly higher in
   ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease patients, than in
   controls. Fibre consumption did not differ between patients and
   controls.<BR>
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that carbohydrate consumption is
   significantly higher in IBD patients than in healthy controls.
   Ulcerative colitis patients also consumed more total protein than
   controls.
   The pathogenetic significance of these findings, however, remains
   unclear.

Two recently published papers provide solid evidence that Mycobacterium 
paratuberculosis is involved in at least a proportion of Crohn's disease. 
Crohn's disease is so similar to mycobacterial diseases 
that it is often confused with one of them, intestinal tuberculosis. 
Alan Kennedy maintains a very interesting web site on the
subject: <A HREF="http://iol.ie/%7ealank/CROHNS/welcome.htm">
&quot;Does Mycobacterium paratuberculosis cause Crohns disease?&quot;</A> -- a

Hi SCD Group,<BR>
<BR>
Some news from the Danish Colitis-Crohn Associations magazine:<BR>
<BR>
The Danish Crohns-Colitis Association recently donated app. 11,000 US dollars 
for a research project which is to either confirm or kill the theory that
there 
could be a relationship between the mycobacterium &quot;Paratuberculosis&quot;
and 
Crohns.<BR>
This mycobacteria can possibly affect the human immune-defense system, 
triggering the infection in the intestines. Since it is a bacteria that
grows 
very slowly, it doesn't &quot;show up&quot; when our doctors and scientists
look for it 
with the standard test methods.<BR>
Two Danish doctors are going to join a professor from University of Wisconsin 
in Madison, USA, in researching, using a new DNA technology.<BR>
<BR>
Also, Danish scientists are presently looking into the effect of yoghurt 
&quot;lactobacilles&quot; which - if used in large quantity - can heal a
wound in a week.<BR>

<P><B>Independent research supports SCD</B><BR>
Fri, 2 May 1997 20:43:45 GMT<BR>
<BR>
New research from nutrional scientists here at the University of Illinois
is published in the following papers:<BR>
<BR>
Campbell et al. 1997. An Enteral formula containing fish oil, indigestible
oligosaccharides, gum arabic, and antioxidants affects plasma and colonic
posphollipid fatty acid and prostaglandin profiles in pigs. <BR>

bowel mass, cecal and fecal short-chain fatty acids, ph and microflora in
rats. <BR>
Journal of Nutrition Science 127:130-136.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These researchers found that commom simple-sugar molecules found in certian
fruits and vegetables promote healthy intestinal function in part because
they provide substrate for beneficial bacteria (bifidobacteria and lactobacilli)
in the lower gut and create an increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
that have anti-inflamatory properties. They specifically note that these
SCFAs &quot;play a critical role in mucosal cell differentiation and, therefore
integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa&quot; and &quot;may be useful in
promoting gastrointestinal health via restoration of normal flora following
antibiotic therapy&quot;. Finally &quot;...the data demonstrate that clinical
studies utilizing human subject are warrented with the UCNF (ulcerative
colitis nutritional formula) to further examine its impact on inflamatory
responses in IBD patients&quot;.<BR>

This is important stuff, folks - because this is controlled research done
at a respected university by researchers with no knowledge of the scd (I
spoke with one of them) that validates much of the scd approach. Something
for the SCD-naysayers to think about!<BR>
<BR>
Hope I've brightened your day,<BR>

P.S. A third study is in the pipeline that says that artichokes, chickory,
onions, garlic, leeks, shallots, chives, peaches, and bananas contain high
levels of desireable oligosacharides. <BR>

Yes, except the SCD explicitly excludes FOS - Fructo Oligiosacharides.<BR>

<B>A certain protein</B><BR>

<BR>
To all:<BR>
I have the opportunity to be involved in a study being done here in Edmonton,
Alberta Canada at the university Hospital. I talked to the research nurse
and in very short terms what it involves is this: The research team has
found that people with Crohn's/colitis are lacking a certain protein and
when this protein is injected back into the body ( much like diabetics do
with insulin), the bowel actually heals. I realize this is an extremely
simplified explanation but my appointment regarding this is tomorrow morning,
so as soon as I have more info I will pass it along. Regardless of<BR>
the outcome, I am going to stick with the diet as I truly believe it has
the potential to heal just like this protein possibly does.<BR>

<B>Interleukin-10</B><BR>

<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Hello everyone:<BR>
I went for my appointment with the research nurse regarding participating
in the treatment study for interleukin-10. She gave me an info sheet so
I thought I'd pass it along.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></TT><B>WHAT IS INTERLEUKIN-10?</B><BR>
Interleukin-10 is a protein which normally circulates in the human body.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF INTERLEUKIN-10 IN THE HUMAN BODY?</B><BR>
All of the functions of Interleukin-10 have not yet been discovered.<BR>
Indeed, Interleukin-10 was only discovered in1988 by a doctor who works
at the University of Alberta. The main function of Interleukin-10 appears
to be in helping control the body's immune system. In particular, interleukin-10
is important in reducing the amount of inflammation in your body and
counteracting
any stimulus that serves to increase inflammation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WHY DO WE THINK INTERLEUKIN-10 WILL WORK IN INFLAMMATORY BOWEL
DISEASE?</B><BR>
First, inflammatory bowel disease is a disease with increased inflammation.<BR>
If interleukin-10 is capable of reducing this inflammation it may have a
beneficial effect. Second, we have discovered that mice deficient in
Interleukin-10
develop inflammatory bowel disease and when they are given Interleukin-10
the inflamatory bowel disease improves.<BR>
<BR>
<B>HOW IS INTERLEUKIN-10 GIVEN?</B><BR>
Interleukin-10 is a protein which is destroyed by stomach acid and thus
cannot be given by mouth. Interleukin-10 is therefore given by an injection
identical to that used for insulin.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WHAT IS THE SIDE EFFECTS OF INTERLEUKIN-10?</B><BR>
Your white blood cell count may fall very slightly while you are receiving
Interleukin-10 . This fallen white blood cell count will not cause you any<BR>
problems. There are no other adverse effects of interleukin-10 that have
been identified.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Well, that's it. I'll know by next week whether or not
I'll be participating, but I suppose it doesn't matter either way because
I'm sticking with the diet but what's the harm in trying something that
naturally occurs in the body anyways ( along with the diet) for an added
benefit or to aid in the healing process.<BR>

Dear Allan and Martine,<BR>
If you are on the SCD all the time, then how will they know whether it's
the diet that's working or the interleukin-10?<BR>

Dear Anna,<BR>
I have been on the diet for about 14 months, however the first seven months
were without any medication and I made very little progress. Improvements
since starting medication in September in conjunction with the SCD have
been steady, but my quality of life is by no means where I would like it
to be.<BR>
A colonoscopy will be done prior to starting the Interleukin-10 treatment
and one after. Therefore any major healing that takes place in that time
was obviously mostly due to the Interleukin. BTW, I had a colonoscopy done
about two months ago that showed quite extensive inflammation in the colon.<BR>
As I mentioned earlier, I have no intention of going off of the SCD and
feel that Interleukin-10, which naturally occurs in the body, can be of
added benefit while sticking to the diet. After all, people take medications
containing some forbidden substances ( i.e. Asacol has lactose) while on
the diet and go into remission. So Interleukin, being totally legal on the
SCD can do no harm and I think it's worth a chance. Ultimately, this study
may benefit the countless number of people suffering from inflammatory bowel
disease today.<BR>
<BR>
Dear Lorraine,<BR>
Welcome to the group! I know you will find it to be very encouraging! It
has been of immense help to me while following the diet religiously. You
mentioned some interest regarding Interleukin-10. I think that it is quite
exciting and if it can aid and perhaps speed up the healing process in
conjunction
with the diet, I am all for it. Approximately 300 patients at 35 multinational
centers will be studied so if you are in Canada it might be worth a shot
to discuss this with your specialist!<BR>
Wishing you all the best on the SCD!<BR>
<BR>
Good health to you all!<BR>

Those in UK maybe interested to know that Guys Hospital with Kings College
Hospital in London are engaged in a research project looking at IBD in families.
Both my brother and myself have UC. They reckon they are about 6 to 12 months
away from discovering the rogue gene which they believe causes the problem.Stress
being the trigger! Despite all the experts telling me that Stress does not
cause it! It won't help provide a cure but at least we can do something
about helping the family line in the future.<BR>
If anybody on e,ail in UK is in this situ, i.e family with UC or Colitis
etc please email me for further details.<BR>
