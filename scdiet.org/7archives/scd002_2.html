&gt;From: Amanda McKee &lt;ajmckee@idirect.com&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Dear Elaine<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have followed your diet carefully for over a year. In the last 2 months<BR>
&gt;it has become apparent that I don't tolerate fruit although I used it<BR>
&gt;successfully at the beginning of the diet.  Any suggestions?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks Amanda<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Can we have cocoa? I mean: not chocolate, but raw cocoa powder. (For
instance,<BR>
&gt;it is delicious to mix cocoa with the yoghurt and honey ... but is it
&quot;legal&quot;?)<BR>

&gt;Subject: Cocoa &amp; carob<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;In the book, chocolate and carob are listed as forbidden foods with
no<BR>
&gt;further explanation. So, I am wondering a) why carob? and b) by chocolate<BR>
&gt;do you mean sweetened forms or do you mean cocoa? and c) If you mean<BR>
&gt;cocoa, what is bad about it?<BR>
&gt;<BR>

To: scdquestions@filmgraphics.com<BR>
<BR>
Some of us are wondering about mayonnaises such as Hain and Spectrum<BR>
that contain grain vinegar. All the other ingredients sound o.k.<BR>
<BR>
There is a Breakstone dry curd cottage cheese that has 'skim milk<BR>
added.' We have been thoroughly rinsing this cheese with water<BR>
through a fine strainer before use. Does this sound o.k.?<BR>

Subject: Question for Elaine<BR>
X-URL: http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/scd002.html<BR>
<BR>
I wrote this question to the SCD group a couple of weeks ago but did not<BR>
have any responses so maybe Elaine could help:<BR>
    Do you know of anyone with CD who has been on the diet whose biggest<BR>
    problem is cramps and nausea due (in my case) to a 20 cm stricture on
the<BR>
    small intestine from both scarring and inflammation. I have an ilieostomy<BR>
    so diarrhea is not a problem nor is bleeding. Currently I seem to do
best<BR>
    symptom wise on very low residue (almost no fruits or vegetables) and
milk<BR>
    products are not a problem and pass through well.  I feel the diet may
have<BR>
    helped me if I had started it before the stricture but now that I have
it<BR>
    is too late. Thank you, Barbara<BR>
<BR>

Subject: Prednisone-related ulcers<BR>
<BR>
I put my eleven year old son on the diet who has twice been hospitalized
for 30+<BR>
days and given cyclosporine in order to avoid surgery. He showed immediate
signs <BR>
of improvement (4 days into diet) and felt great for next four weeks. Then
he <BR>
got extreme stomach pain with no associated urgency.  After about three
weeks of <BR>
pain his doctor at Mayo gave him ulcer medication and the pain went away.
He is <BR>
on 10mg of pred. and Asacol and 6MP. Have you ever heard of the diet causing<BR>
anyone to get pred. related ulcers?<BR>
<BR>
After two weeks of the stomach pain we took him off the diet even though
his <BR>
doctors did not think the diet caused ulcers.  They also do not put much
stock <BR>
in the diet but the diet's effects were so powerful that I have no doubt
it <BR>
needs to be studied.  So far his urgency has not returned but if it does
I will <BR>
reintroduce the diet for more than the 1-2 months he was on it prior to
the <BR>
stomach pain.<BR>

Subject: Daughter's Crohn's<BR>
<BR>
Ms. Gottschall,<BR>
I'm very grateful for your diet. My 10 year old daughter was recently diagnosed<BR>
with CD. It was, and is, a very scary time for us.  Being holistically oriented,<BR>
I opted to try the SCD before drugs. Initially, my daughter had remarkable<BR>
success in a very short period of time -- the first month was great. After
that<BR>
(this is going on the 4th month), she downslided and now is better than
before<BR>
the diet, but not well enough to feel confident or at all good about the
future. <BR>
I am scared to death of prednisone, but I am tired of my daughter's suffering.
<BR>
She has been amazing in her commitment to this diet, but she, too, is losing
<BR>
confidence (&quot;Mommy, will I need to take that awful drug that will make
my face <BR>
swell?&quot;). The biggest problem is the growth suppression -- she has
barely grown <BR>
in over 2 yrs. She has gained some weight on this diet (her appetite is
<BR>
fantastic now), but no height. I am very scared for her.  I feel torn and
<BR>
confused and I dread doing drugs and surgery and doubt that they will help<BR>
beyond the immediate suppression of symptoms. I need so much to believe
she can <BR>
get well. Do I need to be patient with her growth?  The info in the medical
<BR>
texts on this subject is not conclusive or clear.  Please share any insights
or <BR>
experiences with me that might help me understand better what to expect.
<BR>
Thanks and God Bless. Joyce<BR>

A RECENT REPLY FROM JOYCE HERSELF FOLLOWS:<BR>
<BR>
From: &quot;Joyce Lavery&quot; &lt;joycekling@hotmail.com&gt;<BR>
To: scd@filmgraphics.com<BR>
Subject: Daughter's progress<BR>
<BR>
I sent a message to this group about a month ago re: my daughter's CD and
my<BR>
concern for her growth (or lack thereof). Good news: after 4 months on the<BR>
SCD, she has gained 7 lbs and grown 1 inch. Her skin color looks great once<BR>
again, no diarrhea, no pain -- her entire body has begun to look healthy
again!<BR>
She still has a long way to go, but I doubt she'd have gotten this far without<BR>
the SCD and if I went the traditional medical route.  So far, we have abstained<BR>
from the prednisone her doctor insisted she needed or she'd be asking for
a <BR>
bowel resection! <BR>
<BR>
The lesson: be patient with this diet -- my daughter is 10 and has kept
<BR>
faithfully to this diet because she knows how much it helps her.  <BR>
<BR>
Some breakfast ideas: we use a turkey sausage (Shelton's from the health
food <BR>
store) for breakfast, yogurt (made w/ half&amp;half) &quot;sundaes&quot;
(yogurt, crushed <BR>
nuts, fruit, honey), toast (Lois Lang's recipe) or a nut muffin with lots
of <BR>
honey butter, and we found one brand of bacon w/o sugar we use occasionally.<BR>
<BR>
For sodas: R.W. Knudsen makes natural sodas made with only fruit juice and<BR>
carbonated water. She tolerates it well and it makes her feel less &quot;odd&quot;
when<BR>
she finds one in her lunch-box. She also loves all the desserts. <BR>
<BR>
This diet is a wonder, but it takes commitment and some hard work (and I
do find <BR>
it much more costly) -- but worth it and do-able.  The supplements she uses
are <BR>
prescribed by a holistic MD are all starch-, sugar-, and yeast-free.  She
takes <BR>
SuperEPA, castor bean oil (a natural anti-yeast supplement), acidophilus,
<BR>
polyenzymes, and a multi, occasionally C, magnesium, and B's. It's been
a hard, <BR>
often lonely road, but I know she is getting better.<BR>

From Michael:<BR>
Great North Beans are supposed to be a variety of haricot (navy) beans,
are they <BR>
OK? likewise with Canellini is this variety of navy bean OK?<BR>

<BR>
<B>Answers from Elaine Gottschall</B><BR>
Fri, 3 Jan 1997 5:31:41 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I would like to start out by saying that I did not develop this diet.  It
was<BR>
developed by doctor Sidney Valentine Haas who was an internationally acclaimed<BR>
celiac specialist and who cured my daughter of ulcerative colitis in New
York<BR>
City in the 60's.  At that time, we availed ourselves of every specialist
in the<BR>
area with no success and only the suggestion that the colon would have to
be<BR>
removed.<BR>
<BR>
When she was cured, I entered university and spent almost 12 years in<BR>
an effort to understand how something as simple as a diet could cure such
a<BR>
serious disease.  After doing 7 years of research at the cellular level
I did 6<BR>
years of consulting and found that the diet can reverse many of the other
bowel<BR>
problems.<BR>
<BR>
I do not have the analysis of every food in the world and when I do not
know for<BR>
example all the components in the food I say, &quot;avoid it&quot;.  I cannot
draw <BR>
chemical structures and try to explain every question you have.  If you
cannot <BR>
follow the diet just as it is in the book then don't bother with it.<BR>
<BR>
If you knew how much genetic breeding is going on with vegetables and fruits
and<BR>
how nobody is interested in whether or not the new cultivar (product) is<BR>
digestible or not, then you could appreciate the fact that when certain
beans<BR>
are specified and not others, it is because of the fact that some of these
beans<BR>
have starch in them that is not digestible and can interfere with the diet's<BR>
effectiveness.  <BR>
<BR>
I can assure you that you will have tremendous variety and a healthy nutritious
<BR>
diet if you make certain variations to the basic recipes in the book.  But
the <BR>
diet takes time &amp; if you cannot give it time then forget it.<BR>
<BR>
As I say in the book: after one month you will know if it is good for you.<BR>
Please do not keep asking me if you can have chocolate, cocoa and carob.<BR>
I have specified in the book that THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED.<BR>
<BR>
You are to make your own mayonnaise &amp; can use grain vinegar.  You cannot
trust <BR>
any labels and when you ask about HAIN and SPectrum, you are contradicting<BR>
the advice in the book. - you are to make your own.<BR>
<BR>
To Barbara who asked about the strictures: sometimes surgery is needed as
the <BR>
diet cannot reverse scar tissue in the muscle wall, but many people have
found<BR>
that after a couple of months, all of the symptoms go away and you can avoid<BR>
surgery. (Editor's note: not a cure of the scar tissue, but an alleviation
of<BR>
the symptoms).  Each person is different.  EVERYTHING ON THIS DIET IS WHOLESOME<BR>
FOOD.  The food that brought about Crohn's disease is in most cases pure
junk<BR>
food and the shameful thing is that no health professional ever showed any<BR>
interest in guiding you properly.<BR>
<BR>
To the person that asked about the diet causing prednisone-related ulcers:
no, <BR>
I have never heard of good nutritious food causing prednisone-related ulcers.<BR>
<BR>
If a person cannot tolerate fruit, then eliminate it.  But if the fruit
is<BR>
prepared properly and the person has eliminated ALL the NOT PERMITTED foods,<BR>
most often cooked, peeled fruit can be tolerated.  (Editor's note: personally
I,<BR>
Michael, can tolerate stewed peeled, cored apples at the moment but not
stewed<BR>
pears - too much fibre).  I cannot tell you more than that.  Usually when
the<BR>
person talks to me personally, I find that there are many other factors
entering<BR>
into the problem. Perhaps if you discontinue the fruit for a while, then
you can<BR>
try it later.<BR>
<BR>
To the person who thinks it is too late for the diet since she has developed
a<BR>
stricture please be assured that 100's of people have had this same condition.
 <BR>
Often a resection is needed to get rid of the stricture, but they follow
the <BR>
diet for a couple of years and regain their health and know how to prevent
any <BR>
further problems.  Dr Bayer (on the back cover of the book) is one of the
100's <BR>
who found this out.<BR>
<BR>
To Michael - Great North Beans are OK but I cannot answer your question
about <BR>
Cannellini. Kidney beans are OK too. Why not stick to what we know?<BR>
<BR>
I know the diet works in many cases but not all. You are eating good nutritious
<BR>
food on the diet, but some of you are still addicted to the very junk that
<BR>
caused the problem.  This is especially true in small intestinal Crohn's
but not <BR>
so much the case in Ulcerative Colitis.  But please do not trust the labels
and <BR>
try to get someone to help you with things like the ketchup and the mayonnaise
<BR>
if you do not have the time or the patience.<BR>
<BR>
One thing necessary is a food processor. When I had my daughter on the diet,
<BR>
I only had a blender and one can manage with that, but food processors are
a <BR>
good investment and will save you time.<BR>
<BR>
Bart: Try and get the real dry curd cheese. But you can treat the cheese
you are <BR>
using with &quot;Lactaid&quot; drops.  However it is so wasteful to use
that watered-down<BR>
cheese. Surely someone in the group lives near you and is able to get dry<BR>
farmer's or baker's cheese as it may be called.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to all, and a happy and healthy 1997.

<B>Fax from Elaine Gottschall </B><BR>
Fri, 20 Jun 1997 13:12:48 GMT<BR>
<BR>
FROM: Elaine Gottschall<BR>
<BR>
Subject: <B>Careless adherence to diet outlined in &quot;Breaking the vicious
cycle&quot;</B><BR>
<BR>
First of all, I am happy that the group has been reestablished. I know how
helpful it is to communicate with others as you try to get over inflammatory
bowel disease along with related problems.<BR>
<BR>
However I have received a few letters and telephone calls which have caused
me a lot of aggravation. I want all of you to get better so badly that when
something happens that I know will retard your progress, I am saddened.<BR>
<BR>
My understanding is that the issue of canned foods has come up, and I would
like to address it. In the 1900's Dr. Haas told us not to use them and I
would never have thought of doing so.Additionally, in the last 30 years,
things have gotten much worse in the processing of foods. If you use canned
foods, the diet will not be as effective, or it may not work at all. THE
LABELS ARE MOST OFTEN DECEPTIVE. The companies have continuously put cornstarch
and refined sugar in canned food and have not labeled accordingly.<BR>
<BR>
Some acquaintances who work for canners tell me that carloads of sugar stand
by the tanks where vegetables and fruits are being prepared, and as the
chemist tests for sweetness, in goes the sugar, down the chutes into the
vats. It is not on the label.<BR>
<BR>
Just because you buy something in a health food store does not guarantee
the label is correct.. An aquantance of mine told me about the &quot;wonderful&quot;
dried cranberries she was snacking on. She took me to the health food store
in Toronto and showed me the product. I tasted it; it was sweet. On the
box it said &quot;no sugar added&quot;. I said to the owner &quot;did you
ever taste a cranberry? it is more sour that rhubarb - why and how did it
get so sweet?<BR>
He turned red and was going to call the packer.<BR>
<BR>
I would also be careful of ordering nuts from Dutch Valley. I tried to check
it out and came to the conclusion that it is not up to standards.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to quote from a part of Dr. Haas's book, The Management of
Celiac Disease:<BR>
Among milder cases of bowel disease, there is a degree of tolerance for
carbohydrates which allows for careless treatment with fair results, but
cure requires two or three times as long as would be the case if a strict
diet were followed. In some cases the symptoms are a little relieved, but
physical progress is maintained, so as to obscure the fact that a cure was
not obtained. Fortunately, time eventually seems to help these cases to
get well, although many of them go through life with a tendency toward loose
stools... The SCD with the proper type of carbohydrate to be fed is of the
utmost importance, as experience in these cases shows that even the smallest
quantity of the forbidden carbohydrate will precipitate diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
                                    ***<BR><BR>
                                    
This is the fax that Elaine sent to me and I pass it on to you. If nothing
else, it certainly makes clear her position on canned foods.<BR>
<BR>
Love to all, Rachel<BR>

To: scd-list@longisland.com<BR>
Subject: <B>Talked to Elaine</B><BR>
<BR>
I spoke to Elaine this week. <BR>
<BR>
1.  After two weeks on the diet, I had terrible heartburn and was<BR>
sticking to the original 5 day diet.  She said she never intended for<BR>
anyone to be on it for more than 5 days and it was only to clean out<BR>
your system from grains.  She had me stop the yogurt for a few days and<BR>
&quot;eat everything except the muffins.&quot;  She said to have a couple spotted<BR>
bananas and a couple baked apples/applesauce a day.  And for the time<BR>
being, only cooked vegetables.  And she recommended avocado.  Too bad I<BR>
can't stand avocado.  The heartburn cleared in 24 hours so the initial<BR>
diet was hurting me.<BR>
<BR>
2.  She thought that probiotics were important.  She recommended Natren<BR>
brand and gave a phone number 1-800-992-3323, extension 132, Connie. <BR>
She recommended a lactose base saying the acidophilus thrived on it and<BR>
it was such a small amount that it shouldn't cause problems.  I called<BR>
and it is $109 for the powder which Connie said worked for most, $144<BR>
for 90 capsules which she recommends for UC people.  <BR>
<BR>
3.  For someone with diarrhea this is a recipe she gave for homemade<BR>
pedialite (spelled wrong most likely).  1 quart water, 2 tablespoons<BR>
honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda.  This can be kept<BR>
one day and then a new batch has to be made.  Because of the honey it<BR>
will grow bacteria if left longer.<BR>
<BR>
4.  We talked about my specific case, that I had UC because of giardia<BR>
and Lyme Disease.  She said both would certainly cause that.  She said<BR>
most people didn't experience &quot;die-off&quot; so she didn't know whether I<BR>
should expect to or not.<BR>

Further comment by Elaine:<BR>-->

<BR>
V-8 has, of late, used concentrate for its tomato juice.  I still think I<BR>
would use it since it is relatively a small amount and there are so many<BR>
other ingreditents. <BR>
<BR>
I'm sorry I'm dubious about some questions.  The cheeses should be checked<BR>
out if they are questionable.  Write to the company.  Generally speaking,<BR>
if they have a bacterial culture added, they are ok - like camembert.<BR>
<BR>
The canned fishes are giving some people strange symptoms.  A doctor's wife<BR>
(a celiac who has been on the diet 4 years and thriving) told me she<BR>
reacts.  [She] thinks it is because of raising some fish in fish farms and<BR>
using antibiotics as they are overcrowded.<BR>
<BR>
I think sunflower oil (or olive oil) is safer than canola.  I use sunflower<BR>
for my mayonnaise.<BR>

Subject: <B>Answers from Elaine to recent questions</B><BR>
<P>Here are the answers to the recent questions compiled Shannon and Michelle and
faxed to Elaine.  Michelle faxed the answers to me to transcribe because she
is very busy.  There were 2 spots where I had to guess a little due to a
couple of letters getting cut off or not being able to interpret a handwritten
note on the fax.  I noted these areas and Michelle and Shannon can correct if
necessary (Questions 6 and 7).  
<P>brian (<A HREF="mailto:BluesVan@aol.com">BluesVan@aol.com</A>)
<P>Here it is.
<P><B>From Shannon:</B>

<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Elaine, here are a set of questions from the e-mail group on-line.  Once
again, we are sending them as one fax, saving your from receiveing all the
questions individually.  Thank you in advance for your answers.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR><BR>



<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 1:  Can we have figs?</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> If you have diarrhea (movements still not formed and water brown) do
not eat them.  And when you are really getting well, you can eat the dried
ones although they sometimes are very tough.  I'd try and get a softer fig
than the ones on the string at the supermarket.
<BR><BR><BR>



<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 2:  Can we use flax/linseed oil? </FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> It can be used but don't go overboard.  I would say no more than 1
teaspoon a day.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 3:  I know raw sauerkraut is SCD safe but is it an acidophilus
alternative for someone who can't eat yougurt?  Would probiotics be necessary
instead?</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> When Dr. Haas said sauerkraut was OK, we had to go (in 1960's) to ONE
ONLY German deli to buy it.  So be careful of what brand you buy.  It is not
an alternative for L.acidophilus and L.bulgaricus although some of the same
bacteria may be present.  Especially for UC patients, the probiotics can be
very helpful.  I am not a supporter of bifidis or some of the other strains -
L.acid. and L.bulgaricus are good for UC;  for Crohn's I am not so sure.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 4:  Is taro root acceptable?</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> NO NO NO  It is a starchy tuber.  You can bet that any such product
has the worst possible starch in it for the IBD sufferers.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 5:  &quot;Some companies are producing sour cream which contains
virtually
no lactose.&quot; (page 56)  What amount of lactose is acceptable?  
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> About 1-2% lactose is acceptable.  But often these sour creams have
lots of other things in them which are not acceptable.  I realize that 1/2 +
1/2 has carageenan in it but use it anyhow.  When I use half and half or
cream, to make my youghurt, I get a superb sour cream.  Yes, I know it takes
time but it is my first priority.  That is why I did not think I could answer
your fax until after Christmas.  I was trying to make my super-duper veggie
soup and with interruptions it took me about 5 hrs.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 6:  You recently said during your speech in Vancouver, B.C. that the
diet helped arthritis.  Is this Rheumatoid Arthritis or some other forms? (I
have an aunt with Rheumatoid Arthritis.)
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> Yes, this same diet is being used by Dr. Allan Springer 
in England for RA and the most prestigious
medical journals have supported this.  What has she to lose - just 3 weeks and
she'll know.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 7:  Beans: Several questions here.  
<P>Question 7A:  The book states theat legumes must be soaked for &quot;at least
10-12
hours.&quot;  Is longer than 23 hours preferred?  What is optimum?
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> I have always  been told to soak overnight - about 12 hours.  I
imagine that is good enough.
<BR><BR><BR>





<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 7B:  Would changing the soaking water several times during the
soaking help?
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> If your have a few beans in a large bowl, it may not be necessary to
change water.  But if they are crowded, yes, change it - what can it hurt ! !
!
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 7C:  Do lentils and split peas also need to be soaked?  (There is a
confusing note on the web site about not soaking some lentils.  Split peas are
dried peas - we eat peas fresh from the vine.)
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> Yes - maybe not as long as beans.  2 to 3 hours is OK.  
I would soak them (lentils).  The peas we
grow inour gardens are not the same strain (genetically) as those which are
grown for dried peas.  That means that the starch component is quite different
from the peas we grow in the garden.  For example, Kellogg's have the farmers
grow a special strain of corn for cornflakes which is called waxy maize which
is indigestible by our digestive systems and by animals as well.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 8:  Is the herb echinacea (sold by both dry and in liquid form) SCD
safe?
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> When taking these herbs I would try and get the liquid form in
alcohol as the pill forms are packed in lactose usually.  I use aconite in
alcohol distillate.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 9:  Are fresh plantains allowed? (not the chips)
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> Not really, they have far more natural starch than bananas and I
think they have to get almost black before all the starch turns to acceptable
sugar.  But in medical history, doctors used dry plaintain flour for celiacs
and others with intest. problems in order to bake (w/the flour from
plantains).  Even in the 1900's (early, they knew grain flour was BAD).
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 10:  Is regular table salt acceptable?  There has been discussion on-
line about iodized salt containing dextrose and thus not being SCD safe.  Is
that true?  (Of course, this salft is unavoidable when eating out.)
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> Dextrose is an acceptable sugar it is synonomous with glucose.  It is
OK to use it.  We have always used iodized salt even years ago when Judy was
on the diet.  But you are correct in watching labeling because things are
always changing.  But, yes, I think it is OK - don't worry about it.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 11:  The book says, &quot;If you forget to remove it [the yogurt]
after 24
hours, and the fermentation goes on longer, all the better.&quot;  Some are
leaving
theirs 36 or even 48 hours.  Is this acceptable or too long?
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> I think up to about 36 is maximum.  I don't think 48 is wise.  I
believe it it can get yeasty quicker even after refrigeration if you ferment
beyond 24-36 hours.
<BR><BR><BR>




<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Question 12:  On the phone, ou said my husband could have psyllium.  Now,
there seems to be some confusion.  Is it acceptable?  Would it be acceptable
for someone with severe constipation to use flax or psyllium?  If not, what
would you recommed for her?
</FONT>
<P><B>Elaine's Reply:</B> Do not use ground flax, it is too much roughage.  Some people when
they first go on the diet are taking sugarless Metamucil either for diarrhea
onr constipation.  I usually say keep it up.  It sometimes prevents urgency by
bulking up the stool.  In the long term, I do not think it is necessary as the
diet addresses severe constipation provided that enough bulky foods like
bananas and baked squash and muffins are eaten.

<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
<P>Thank you very much for your time.  We know you are a busy person.  Enjoy your

<B>Note at end from Elaine:</B><BR><BR>

Dear All - I fortunately had 12 hours of sleep last night or I would have shot
the bunch of you.  Kidding aside, I love hearing from you but with all the
cooking, shipping out of books, answering the phone (6 calls and 4 faxes to
answer yesterday am) and taking care of the house and garden and running into
Toronto to lecture, I do get tired.  But I would be complaining if it were
otherwise.  Have a wonderful Christmas, Hanakuh and/or holiday season.

On Fri, 12 Feb 1999, Elaine Gottshall writes:


<P>Before I attempt to answer your questions, I would like to mention 2
recent articles:   <BR>
(1) in Feb., 1999 The Atlantic Monthly, written by J.
Hooper and called  A NEW GERM THEORY:  <BR> 
<A HREF="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99feb/germs.htm">
http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99feb/germs.htm</A><BR>
The scientists developing this
theory suggest that most diseases such as lupus, MS, hea(r)t disease,
etc., are caused by bacteria/virus.  It is not an easy article to
understand although it is written for non-scientists.  <BR>
Schizophrenia is
also included as pathogenically caused. There's a lot of good factual
matter which support the diet but it would take pages to communicate it.
<P>The other article is one that appeared in SCIENCE Sept. 11, 1998
entitled GRAIN FEEDING AND DISSEMINATION OF ACID RESISTANT ESCHERICIA
COLI FROM CATTLE.  <BR>
I am going to include these findings in the upcoming
new printing of my book following the discussion of lactic acid on page
18.   <BR>
It will read something like this: <BR> <BR>


<P>In 1998, a group of researchers at Cornell University reported in
SCIENCE a similar phenomenon occurring in cattle as a result of the
overfeeding of grain starch.  An overwhelming amount of grain starch fed
to cattle produces fermentation of the disaccharide maltose (a
degradation product of starch) and produces the volatile fatty acids
show in Figure 4 on page 17.   <BR>
This acid environment in the colon results
in making E. coli bacteria ACID-RESISTANT by lowering the acidity of the
bacterial environment in the intestine. . As a result the normal acidity
of the human stomach which normally destroys harmful bacteria would have
no effect on these pathogenic acid-resistant E. coli.   <BR>
I have a notion
that when bacteria become acid-resistant because of fermentation acids,
there may be a change in the DNA and turn them from non-harmful
intestinal bacteria into pathogens.  But for this latter point, I must
get to people who are working on this and that is always a problem. <BR>

<P>1.  Are macadamia nuts acceptable? <BR>
2.  Are pine nuts acceptable?</FONT>

<P>Macadamia and pine nuts are fine as long as they do not go through a
roasting process which invariably (commercially) coats them with starch.
 I roast my own blanched whole almonds, walnuts, etc., by spreading on a
cookie sheet with dabs of butter and roast at 350 until they start
showing a little brown.  I turn them onto a paper towel, pat them dry
and salt them.  Jar them and use when wanted.

3.  Is okra allowed?

starch which is probably bad for IBDers.

6.  As I understand it, tomato juice was preferred over canned tomato
products because it wasn't from concentrate but it often is now.  Is it
still safe? </FONT>


<P>I do believe that tomato juice is OK whether it be from concentrate or
not.  Just get the kind with only salt added.

7.  So many juices, even those in cartons, are from concentrate.  Are
frozen or canned on the shelf fruit juices allowed on the diet?  Is
orange juice with calcium acceptable?
</FONT>

<P>Calcium in orange is OK.  I just looked my Tropicana carton and it has
nothing added altho it gives the analysis of the amount of some minerals
such as potassium, calcium on the label.  I would stick with the juices
in the book - no canned except the pineapple I mentioned and the Welch's
grape juice (purple).  DO NOT USE THE SMALL JUICE BOXES - I have heard
too many stories about their manufacture.  Do not believe labels - just
use either your own squeezed juice, the pineapple, the grape and a good
quality orange juice such as Tropicana.

<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
8.  Are raw vegetables and salads okay if bowel movements are solid but
still seeing some blood and mucous and experiencing a feeling of urgency?
</FONT>

<P>I wouldn't go hog-wild on raw veggies (salads such as lettuce and
tomatoes are OK) such as cabbage slaw or grated carrots if there is a
lot of blood and mucous. 
They can be physically irritating to the mucous layer even though the
biochemistry will not grow microorganisms.


<BR><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
9.  Someone found a recipe for a homemade cheese like DCCC.  You put
lemon juice in the milk and it curdles, then you drain it and rinse. 
Would this be SCD safe?
</FONT>

<P>I do not think the homemade DCCC is terribly risky but if you look at
page 145, it states that along with this process, it is followed by
application of a bacterial culture such as found in yoghurt. .


<BR><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
10.  Someone spoke with you at a book signing and asked if she could
treat cream with lactaid drops, then use it in her coffee.  You said
&quot;yes.&quot;  Could this cream be used in soups and other things?  Could
untreated cream be used in this way? (some on the bulletin board say it
has less lactose than milk)</FONT>


<P>The person as the book signing must have reported great improvement
before I would say she could treat cream with lactaid drop and use a
small amount in coffee.  Absolutely not to be used in large amounts in
soup.  It's the old &quot;saw&quot; - &quot;give a person a finger and they want the
whole hand.&quot;  That is exactly why I am so very adamant about following
the book methodically and fanatically.


<P>Untreated cream can be made into yoghurt and it will be a wonderful sour
cream.  Do not use cream just with lactaid drops - there are other
reasons for this which would have to be talked about but I could not do
justice to it by writing about it.


<BR><BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" FACE="arial, helvetica">
11.  You said we could use date sugar.  It isn't necessarily made from
California dates.   Are California dates specified because genetically
they are better for us or because of how they are treated? (i.e. no
sugar added in processing, etc.)  My  organic food catalog lists dates
but none that are specifically &quot;California&quot; so thought perhaps other
kinds that were organic would be allowed.
</FONT>

<P>Yes, date sugar must come from California dates.  They are specified
because they never have corn syrup added such as the Mid-east ones which
clump together.  Every carton of dates I have ever bought has
&quot;California&quot; on the label (and that spans 45 years).  If your organic
catalogue does not specify where the dates are from, I would not order
from them.

12.  Is light rum allowed?  (I read that dark rum can have caramel added
for coloring so know that is no)
</FONT>

<P>Yes, light rum is OK.  I do not know if all dark rum is artificially
colored but stay with light.

13.  Is dry vermouth allowed? 
</FONT>

<P>Vermouth, I believe has some sugar in it . . I just called my liquor
store and dry vermouth has considerable sugar in it.

14.  Is red wine vinegar allowed?
</FONT>


<P>Yes, red wine vinegar is not only allowed but great!  However, I have
had trouble with cider vinegar so I would be careful with it.

15.  One of the members on the board just posted her recipe for sour
cream.  Is this acceptable?


<P>&quot;It's the same as making yogurt, but you use either the powdered 'sour
cream/buttermilk starter/ OR regular commercial buttermilk from the
supermarket with no additives.  The difference is, you don't need to use
the yogurt maker because the temperature required for fermentation is
room temperature!  It's actually easier to make than yogurt because of
this. . .


<P>I will list the exact instructions for those interested:
<P>- bring to boil one litre/quart half and half cream.
 <BR>-allow it to cool to room temperature.
 <BR>-strain out any skin that has formed on the top.
 <BR>-remove about a cup or so of the cooled cream, and add to it 1/3 cup of
commercial additive free buttermilk, OR freeze dried powdered sour
cream/buttermilk/fresh cheese starter (this is what it should say on the
envelope).
 <BR>-stir for at least 2 minutes until completely dissolved
 <BR>-pour the cup of cream mixture back into the container of the rest of
cooled cream.
 <BR>-stir well to combine.
 <BR>-pour into 2 or more containers (such as glass jars, or plastic sour
cream or yogurt containers)
 <BR>-cover tightly and place in an undisturbed spot in the kitchen, such as
the back corner of the counter top.
 <BR>-leave it to incubate for 24-30 hours.  It should be done in 24 hours
but it won't hurt to leave it up to 30, but then it should be
refrigerated to prevent mold, and spoilage.
 <BR>. . . The homemade kind has no lactose, as far as I know (and it has
never bothered my stomach), and it is perfectly thick and tastes exactly
like real sour cream, not yogurty.&quot;
 <BR> <BR></FONT>

<P>Sorry, I do not like the sour cream recipe.  Any bacterial action at
room temperature is suspect.  I do not know why the yoghurt recipe in
the book and using half-and-half product or whipping cream would not
work well.


<P>This type of &quot;French Cream&quot; does not taste yoghurty.
