My sense from hearing about candida (which, by the way, is more <BR>
properly pronounced CAN-dida, not can-DEE-da) for years and years is <BR>
that it's a more prevalent problem than the hardcore medical line <BR>
would say, but not nearly as ubiqitous as the many authors and product <BR>
sellers and certain practitioners would have us believe. There's a lot <BR>
of literature out there connecting every problem under the sun to <BR>
candida without a whole lot of solid data to back it up. It's hard to <BR>
diagnose, hard to say whether it's a cause or a result of another <BR>
problem, and beware especially of self-diagnostic questionnaires.<BR>

Hi Ted,<BR>
<BR>
Where have you been lately?<BR>
<BR>
I've been having a lot of problems with candida, my suggestion is that you<BR>
get a FEW books on the subject. They vary widely. The best I've seen is
a<BR>
virtual encylopedia and the source of almost all my orthomolecular<BR>
knowledge. It's called &quot;It could be allergy and it can be cured.&quot;
It's not<BR>
based around the scd diet, but the scd diet can be adapted to fit and the<BR>
additional information on vital topics is very well covered: environmental<BR>
factors, candida associated allergies and intolerances, the importance of<BR>
rest, oxygen and sleep, as well as what medications to use and how to tell<BR>
your doctor what to do ; just to name a few.<BR>
Phillip Alexander is the author.<BR>
<BR>
Any good book on the subject should cover the following principles of treatment:<BR>
<BR>
1.Suppression of the yeast infection with a specific anti-candida medication.<BR>
<BR>
Nystatin at low to increasing dosage<BR>
Caprilic acid<BR>
Garlic<BR>
Fungilin<BR>
Nizoral<BR>
<BR>
2: Starvation of the yeast by diet modification:<BR>
<BR>
Elimination of Simple carbohydrates<BR>
<BR>
Honey,<BR>
Lactose,<BR>
Fruit Juices<BR>
<BR>
3: Avoidance of Yeast Promoting medications<BR>
<BR>
broad spectrum anti-biotics.<BR>
immunosuppressants such as cortisone and imuran<BR>
<BR>
4: Resting the immune system by avoidance of yeast foods<BR>
<BR>
reducing the workload on the immune system enables it to have the energy
to<BR>
kill candida. This is a key factor. All the others just weaken the yeast.<BR>
The immune system is the one that finishes it off, but only if it is<BR>
energised enough. Eating yeast foods, tires out the immune system since
it<BR>
is forced to &quot;shadow box&quot; these invaders that mimic the candida.<BR>
<BR>
yeast foods include: bread, all hard cheeses (only the DCCC allowed and
the<BR>
yogurt) wine beer and vinegar.<BR>
<BR>
5:Identification and avoidance of chemicals and other allergens<BR>
<BR>
reduce load on immune system caused by :<BR>
<BR>
car fumes; chemical pollutants; insecticides colours; preservatives;<BR>
emulsifiers and food allergens as well as inhaled allergens.<BR>
<BR>
6: Avoidance of yeast spores.<BR>
<BR>
Mould spores are released invisibly by the millions into the air by mould<BR>
in areas such as bathroom, kitchen and around leaking pipes in walls.<BR>
Remove the mould or move out to a dry sunny spot.<BR>
<BR>
7: Vitamins and mineral supplement are vital for the program since candida<BR>
taxes the bodies own reserves of vitamins and minerals.<BR>
<BR>
It's not something to be rushed into.<BR>
<BR>
To do this on the diet, you must be on beans and lentils and peas. Daily<BR>
and rotated to avoid getting an allergy and to get enough carbohydrates.<BR>
<BR>
you should build up a reserve of minerals for 4-6 weeks prior with the<BR>
metabolism balancing diet (or a scd modified version there of) then get<BR>
ready to follow all 7 factors at once. Only in this way can it be beaten.<BR>
<BR>

Ted, I did some preliminary research on Candida albicans when I was trying<BR>
to clean it out of my system. I did this with the help of a naturopath<BR>
about two years ago.<BR>
<BR>
Candida, as you probably know, is a stubborn little fungus that creates
a<BR>
number of toxins in your blood stream, including manufacturing alcohol.<BR>
According to the naturopaths, these toxins are responsible for a great<BR>
deal of side effects, including irritible bowel syndrome and inflamatory<BR>
bowel disease. Women also have the unique pleasure of having a propensity<BR>
toward yeast infections in addition to all the junk men have to suffer.<BR>
<BR>
Candida growth is promoted by the consumption of many of the things that<BR>
are proscribed by the SCDiet. For example, sugar and starches.<BR>
Additionally, you are supposed to avoid consumption of funguses and booze,<BR>
because each of these things helps the fungus do its dirty business.<BR>
Plus, the usual suspects, stress and general poor health, do wonders for<BR>
Candida. And avoid antibiotics and steroids like the plague!<BR>
<BR>
So, what to do? Well, some herbs kill candida (I'm thinking of pau<BR>
d'arco); other herbs reduce inflammation (slippery elm), and aloe vera is<BR>
supposed to be good for everyone's guts.<BR>
<BR>
I should mention that I had little or no success on the candida diet,<BR>
which I attribute to my own lack of discipline, rather than a failure of<BR>
the protocol.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck and I hope this helped.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<B>Ted,</B><BR>
I am most definitely a candida sufferer, having a visible coating on<BR>
my tongue for the last 30 years, bouts of athlete's foot, microscopic<BR>
verification using a saliva test, and many other hallmark symptoms. I did
a<BR>
search on the net using &quot;candida&quot; and found a very thorough description
of<BR>
this syndrome under the heading of Citricidal. Their outline of the<BR>
symptoms of Candida is exhaustive and brilliant but their product has not<BR>
helped me at all.<BR>
I have also tried Colloidal Silver which is a highly controversial<BR>
and highly touted cure all. A search on the net will bring up an<BR>
unbelievable amount of info on this product with some very severe warnings<BR>
on possible long term toxicity. I can't really say whether the silver has<BR>
helped me or not. I have lately been doing unusually well. But my tongue<BR>
is still coated.<BR>
Good luck in your search. The candida link is explored on the<BR>
Crohn's Colitis site. I have investigated the ideas of Dr. Hulda Clark.<BR>
Her claim is that our bodies are comprised of 85% good bacteria and 15%
bad<BR>
bacteria, virus, fungi, etc. The good bacteria, particularly in the<BR>
digestive tract, are well able to control the bad bacteria. When you toss
a<BR>
few antibiotics down there in the normal course of your life, you knock
out<BR>
some of the good bacteria. According to the medical profession, this is
not<BR>
a major concern, although scientifically correct. According to Hulda Clark,<BR>
the body does not recover well from this assault. The balance is changed,<BR>
now there are maybe 70% good bacteria and 30% bad. Add some sugar, which<BR>
fungi thrive on, and you change the balance more. Dr. Clark declares that<BR>
many of us are running on 85% bad bacteria and 15% good. Makes perfect<BR>
sense to me. Great Smokies Labs will analyze this balance for those who
so<BR>
desire. One fellow on Compuserve was shocked to learn he had no<BR>
Lactobacillus Acidophilus in his sample at all, despite months of intense<BR>
supplementation with probiotics. The bad bacteria clearly had the upper<BR>
hand in his case.<BR>
I believe if you can regain the proper balance, you can get the<BR>
Candida back under control and once again enjoy good health. Easier said<BR>
than done. Elaine states that the diet will do this, but such has not been<BR>
the case for me, at least not quickly. I am of the opinion that this<BR>
disorder requires a comprehensive approach as previously outlined by our<BR>
resident encyclopedic, Michael. I have found that the skin needs to be<BR>
treated as well, particularly hands and feet. Perhaps reinfection is<BR>
occurring through these modes. Particularly hands. I rinsed my hands<BR>
using 6% hydrogen peroxide. I rinsed them twice and rubbed them together.<BR>
On the second rinse, I was shocked to see white patches come up, exactly
the<BR>
same as comes up on my tongue with a hydrogen peroxide swishing. Finding<BR>
the cure for these fungal patches has been a challenge, and of course is<BR>
ongoing.<BR>
At any rate this is the SCD site and not the candida site. I don't<BR>
often post anymore as the diet was not the definitive answer for me.<BR>
However it still forms the basis of everything else that I do while my<BR>
personal search continues unabated. Also I find tremendous help from the<BR>
various postings. My health improvement from the diet has been most<BR>
remarkable, but has not been complete.<BR>
Lately I have been doing really well in all aspects but have not<BR>
been able to pinpoint exactly where the improvement is coming from, and
also<BR>
am not sure that it is permanent. I am keeping a detailed journal, and just<BR>
hoping that this will keep up. As Rachel has stated, I am suspicious that
I<BR>
am predisposed to this disorder and may actually never be free of it. I
am<BR>
also by nature a renegade and have been exploring alternatives not<BR>
acceptable to any intelligent and clear thinking being, especially not<BR>
Elaine! but something is going right, at least for now.<BR>
<BR>
Amanda,<BR>
<BR>
I wish the naturopath had been of more help to you, but your experience
is<BR>
the same as mine. I have been to several. One put me through an interview<BR>
of more than an hour and then prescibed a homeopathic remedy which did<BR>
nothing. They mean well and try hard and charge lots but that's about it,<BR>
from my perspective. I agree with you that in following the diet, empty<BR>
calories are eliminated. The food is packed with nutrition.<BR>
Sheila's suggestion on using Ann Louise Gittleman as a focal point for<BR>
diagnosing parasites is an interesting one, I have considered it and have<BR>
sent away for the info but the cost is high for having a sample evaluated<BR>
and then... will the remedies really work. I am all done with those<BR>
avenues but hope you will give it a try and report back!!<BR>

&lt;I'm wondering if the scd is the diet of choice for those with Candida?<BR>

&lt;UC/Crohn's and others with chronic D?<BR>
<BR></FONT>
According to Elaine, the diet will address candida and the problems<BR>
associated with it.  This is a problem which I suffer from, and if the diet<BR>
cures it, it doesn't do it very quickly!  However, I have found nothing
else<BR>
that works any better, or even comes close,  so I stay with the diet.  While<BR>
not cured, many of my yeast related problems are now history and I will<BR>
forever be grateful to Elaine for that and to the group as well.  Also,
my<BR>
daughter follows the diet loosely and it has been enough to get rid of some<BR>
of her yeast related problems as well.  <BR>
<BR>
I think there was a post from someone objecting to &quot;candida&quot; as
a subject<BR>
but my personal opinion is that this subject is acceptable since this is
in<BR>
fact not a crohn's site but an scd site, and Elaine has stated that the
diet<BR>
will address candida.  I hope that was stated gently enough to not be<BR>
offensive, I'm afraid I'm not very tactful! <BR>
<BR>
I am always searching for backups to the diet that will put an end to this<BR>
miserable disorder, specifically I still battle IBS.  It seems to me that
on<BR>
days when I take the time to exercise, at least 1/2 hour and enough to work<BR>
up a bit of a sweat, that the diet becomes more effective and I am better<BR>
off for a few days.  I know this is only common sense but maybe will help<BR>
someone who is teetering on success as I am, but tottering plenty too.

In the book, those with Candida are told to drastically reduce the amount<BR>
of honey used.<BR>
<BR>
From what I have read in another book the following also should be followed:<BR>
<BR>
No bananas, melons or grapes or any dried fruits<BR>
no canned or bottled fruit juices - only fresh squeezed (in moderation)<BR>
fresh fruit (only 2 pieces per day).<BR>
yoghurt (in small quantities)<BR>
<BR>
In general increase your intake of whole food complex carbohydrates (from<BR>
vegetables)<BR>
<BR>
and yes the oxygen, not the sweat is more desirable, deep breathing (as
for<BR>
yoga) whilst gently walking is what is needed to deeply oxygenate the<BR>
tissues without burning too many calories ( losing weight )<BR>

I don't know, but the fungus loves it!! So many people are not aware of
these little gangsters called CANDIDA. They sit in the gut and are just
waiting for a chance to colonize the colon and ileum. That's what the
youghurt is all about, get the good bugs in and let them conquer Candida and
others. The most famous one - Candida Albicans - produce acetaldehyde from
suger. And, here is one problem, many people don't even know that
acetaldehyd is far more toxic than alcohol. Symtoms are headeach, joint
pain, premenstrual syndrom. The target organ is the brain. Some people get
scizzofrenia from this little fungus.<BR><BR>

Now Candida Albicans is a nice guy as long he is the minority, but as soon
as he gets into position, he will change and grow ROOTS in the gut. And
through the holes he creats in the gut, undigested food will come in contact
with the immune defence behind the mucosa. The resoult is food allergi.<BR><BR>

Maybe I am just boring you with stuff you already know to well, but in my
opinion there is time to focus on other words like SCD and carbohydrates on
this list and also on the IBDLIst!<BR><BR>

 I can't seem to beat the Candidaisis, and can't bear the thought of<BR>
 giving up fruit, cheese, etc. for a long time, so I thought I'd give Pro<BR>
 Biotics a try.   I've been taking Nature's Biotics for about 3 weeks or<BR>
 so, increasing the dosage as suggested on the bottle.   For the past week<BR>
 or so I seem to be having a bit of a relapse.  No -D-, but not normal<BR>
 either.  I'm also sore in the areas were I know my crohn's is.  Could<BR>
 this be the 'die off'  I've heard several of you mention?    I hadn't had<BR>
 any symptoms for about 9 months, so I'm fairly certain the Biotics are<BR>
 the cause, but I don't know if this is 'good' - cleaning out yeast, or a<BR>

I too experienced exactly what you describe. The manufacturer suggests <BR>
that you reduce the frequency of the capsules rather than eliminate them<BR>
entirely.  You should have gotten an instruction sheet explaining this.<BR>
From the instructions, &quot;As Nature's Biotics begins working in the body, <BR>
some people experience various stages of the natural healing process. This<BR>
means that your body is doing its own work, so if you notice any signs<BR>
of flu-like symptoms, fatigue, constipation, or diarrhea, etc., do not become<BR>
discouraged and discontinue using the product. Simply reduce your dosage <BR>
for a few days until you have moved through the condition. Rember, Nature's<BR>
Biotics has no toxic side-effects. Any symptom described is a pro-benefit, in<BR>
that it means your body is responding to the product and working to repair<BR>
itself.&quot;  You may want to review the instruction sheet.   <BR>
I have been taking Nature's Biotics since Nov. 14th  last year and continue<BR>
to do so with great success. <BR>
If  yeast has been isolated from lab tests, taking the Nature's Biotics<BR>
doesn't<BR>
give you a license to cheat from the anti-candida diet. Eating fruit will<BR>
defeat<BR>
the purpose of the probiotic if you have yeast .  The probiotic should<BR>
displace<BR>
the yeast. Feeding the yeast while trying to elliminate it is not a good idea.<BR>
My experience with Nature's Biotics can be found on my web page:<BR>

<BR>
A white tongue is not always a yeast indicator.  I'll quote from Pre. for<BR>
Nut. Healing:  &quot;Fungal infection of the mouth is referred to as oral<BR>
thrush, a condition in which creamy-looking white patches form on the<BR>
tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth.  If the patches are scraped<BR>
off, bleeding may result.&quot;  A COATED  tongue, on the other hand, is also<BR>
white looking but not patchy and not on mucous membranes (cheeks, etc.) <BR>
This can be an indication of the body trying to detox; some say it<BR>
indicates liver function.  (This could very well be the result of a<BR>
diseased gut, or drugs- usually quite hard on the liver.)   Hope this<BR>
clears up any possible confusion.  <BR>

<P>Joyce,
<P>I too was convinced that at least part of my problems were due to
candida. But everything I tried to fight candida failed to do any good,

problems with candida can really exist, I suspect that a lot of cases
are actually something else.
<P>Have you tried the CDSA test from Great Smokies lab? It said that I have
no problem at all with candida, and also identified other organisms that
are indeed causing me problems. The treatment for those organisms helped
right away whereas no candida treatment ever helped me.

Subject: <B>Re: Parasites</B> <BR>
<P>For those of you looking for a lab to test for parasites. The Institute of
Parasitic Disease in Arizona has a great reputation for finding &quot;bugs&quot; that
other labs do not detect, and much less expensive then Great Smokies Lab.  I
originally sent them a stool specimen about 7 months ago and and they found 2
different parasites and a slight overgrowth of candida.  2 Months prior to
that, I was tested by a hospital lab which found nothing.  I took an herbal
formular called Botanefuge for 3 months, was retested and there was no sign of
parasites.  Unfortunately although giving up fruit and honey for 2 months and
of course strict adherence to the SCD minus any yeast foods, such as
mushrooms, alchohol, vinegar...and taking natural remedies for candida
(caprylic acid), I still tested with a slight overgrowth.  I've now been off
of all fruit and honey .... for 4 months.  I am going to be retested again
next week to see if there is any progress in the candida area.  To order a
test kit call (602) 545-9236.  It's about $15.00.  You take your stool
specimen and send to The Institute of Parasitic Disease.  Their phone is (602)
955-4211.  They will fax the results to any doctor you choose including a
holistic doctor.  The actual test is about $70.00.  If you have any questions,
e-mail me.   <BR>
Hope this helps, Lois (UC)  <BR>
