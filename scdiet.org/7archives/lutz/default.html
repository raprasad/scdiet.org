<BR>
W. Lutz's book &quot;Life Without Bread&quot; has seen nine German editions
and is now available in English.  Although its provocative theories have
found not only agreement but also opposition it nevertheless always offers 
stimulating reading . The twentieth century has been dominated by the &quot;lipid
theory&quot; of arteriosclerosis.  This theory assumes that the leading
causes of death (heart attacks, strokes) which are complications 
of arteriosclerosis are adversely affected by lipids such as cholesterol
and &quot;saturated&quot; (animal) fats but are counteracted by unsaturated
vegetable fats.  The theory is accepted by leading scientific organizations
and supported by powerful commercial interests . Lutz's ideas have challenged
the lipid theory which also some others (like myself) believe to be bullton
sand.  Lutz's treatment of the subject of carbohydrates vs protein-fat consumption
is quite ingenuous.  He studied 
the evolutionary development of food consumption and concludes that during
the last 5,000 years a relatively sudden change has occurred by the introduction
of high amounts of starches.  On this basis he favors the return to the
early practices to which man was accustomed. He claims that a protein-fat
diet has advantages in the treatment of many conditions.  Lutz's approach
is controversial but his ideas deserve to be tested.<BR>

<LI><B>Foreword to the Fifth German Edition</B></LI><BR>
<BR>
The first edition of this book appeared in 1967.  It was a courageous feat, at a
time when fat was held to be responsible for coronary infarction and many  other
diseases, to recommend the restriction of nutritional carbohydrate to 60 - 70
grams per day.  An organization supported by the German government had even
stated, without offering plausible supporting evidence, that an office employee
&quot;requires&quot; 350 grams of carbohydrate daily ...  Lutz stirred up a hornet's nest!
In the ensuing years evidence from other sources and his own extensive
experience  have confirmed the value of his concept.  &quot;Leben ohne Brot&quot; has
become almost a slogan and the appearance of this fifth edition is convincing
evidence of the impact caused by  Lutz's ideas on the medical and lay public.
<P>
This book is intended primarily but not exclusively for the medical profession.
Observations on his own person combined with clinical experience were the 
starting point for the &quot;Life without Bread&quot; programme.  Even those who can not
entirely accept Lutz's concepts and hypotheses regarding pathogenesis cannot
afford to ignore this book.  Clinical observations cannot be talked out of 
existence nor should they be dismissed  simply because they conflict with one's 
own theories.  The value of a diet can only be judged on the basis of clinical
experience and practical  success, and does not depend upon biochemical and 
physiological explanations.
<P>
Lutz's book challenges physicians to gather data on a &quot;Life without Bread&quot;.  It 
is an appeal to us to document results in the prophylaxis and therapy of 
adiposity, peptic ulcers, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis, arteriosclerosis and
coronary infarction as well as to record our form of diet on which mankind lived 
for at least two  millions years.

<LI><B>Foreword to the Ninth German Edition</B></LI><BR>
<BR>
Undoubtedly it is a special achievement when a practicing physician and doctor 
of internal medicine developes, without governmental support, a new form of
therapy which is very successful even without the aid of the surgeon's scalpel
or the pharmacist's chemistry.  It goes without saying that a physician should
offer his patients the benefit of every possible approach, i.e.  a stimulating
climate, physical exercise or dietary  change, before he prescribes any
medication or refers the patient to a surgeon.
<P>
Initially, Wolfgang Lutz had felt purely intuitively, without knowing the
theoretical  reasons, that excessive eating of quickly metabolized carbohydrates
-  sugar  and starch  -  is incompatible with the extreme physical inactivity of
modern Man.  Glucose is essential for higher evolved organisms as the efficient
systems of gluconeogenesis and regulation document.  These reactions maintain
the blood sugar level essential for life.  However, the surplus of carbohydrates
combined with minimal physical activity can throw the finely-tuned endocrine
system off balance, and lead to secondary false regulations.  Whole tissue
complexes can thereby lose their function; even minimal stress can lead to
pathological processes.
<P>
Lutz has identified and summarized very nicely the &quot;regulatory diseases&quot; which
respond to carbohydrate restriction.  Furthermore, he was the first to describe
the endocrine events which underlie these disorders.  Generally his view
coincides with the basic metabolic regulation we have postulated based on
experimental results we have, therefore in  cooperation with Prof.  Peter Sallmann,
reproduced the chicken experiments published by Lutz, Andresen, and Buddecke,
and arrived at the same conclusion, namely: the spontaneous arteriosclerosis of
chickens is definitively less developed when carbohydrates are
replaced by isocaloric amounts of fat or proteins. The quality of the fat 
is of secondary importance. 
 <P>
In further experiments we were able to demonstrate that the rates of tumor
growth in experimental animals which follow the application of carcinogens,
diminish significantly when carbohydrates are replaced by the
isocaloric amount of fat.  This can be interpreted as a generally increased stress
tolerance of all body cells and by intensified immune mechanisms, whereby the
developing tumour cells are eliminated more efficiently.
<P>
These results indicate that in addition to tobacco abstinence, a low 
carbohydrate nutrition is the right prophylaxis against arteriosclerosis,
coronary infarct and cancer, since adequate physical exercise becomes more and
more difficult to realize in today's metropolitan life styles.
The same goes for diseases of the gastric intestinal mucosa, to name only a few
examples.  
<P>
One should wish this book, already in its 9th edition, extensive
distribution.  Every physician  should read it and add the simple alternative of
carbohydrate restriction to his therapeutic repertoire.  However, this book is
written in a way that the lay-person also profits from the valuable suggestions
for his own nutrition, and particularly for the nutrition of his/her children.
A low carbohydrate diet keeps teeth healthy more efficiently than brushing them 
several times a day.  With this example I wish the best to &quot;Life without Bread&quot;.

<LI><B>Preface to the first English edition</B></LI><BR>
<BR><IMG SRC="lutz.gif" WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="214" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" 
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
The original title of this book when it was published in German in 
1967 was &quot;Leben ohne Brot&quot; (&quot;Life without Bread&quot;) - 
&quot;Bread&quot; in this case meaning carbohydrates of all kinds.  
The objective was to convince the reader that carbohydrate foodstuffs 
were detrimental to health.
<P>
When Robert Atkins' book (&quot;Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution&quot;) was published 
in 1972, it immediately became a best-seller.  Atkins' success aroused 
the interest of the medical profession which still adhered firmly to 
the theory that animal fats were the culprits eventually leading to heart 
disease and stroke.  Atkins was attacked by the American Medical Association 
and required to give testimony in defence of his ideas before the Senate Select 
Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs.
<P>
This bad experience of Atkins' emphasized the lack of a scientific basis 
for the dogma of health on a low-carbohydrate diet.  Sinde the appearance 
of Stefansson's book &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; in 1957, many authors 
have proposed a diet of this nature for reducing weight.  Despite a number 
of reports of relief in conditions such as high blood pressure, heartburn 
and arthrosis, the low-carbohydrate diet has remained solely a remedy for 
obesity.  Nowhere was the suggestion made that it is man's natural mode of 
nutrion, and thus the ideal diet not only for the healthy but for sufferers 
from every type of ailment.
<P>
I have adhered to this diet myself and have observed for over 26 years its 
effects on well over 10,000 patients.  During this time, so many hitherto unknown 
scientific facts have accumulated in support of the belief that &quot;Life without 
Bread&quot; is universally beneficial that I feel obliged to publish my results.  
It is my hope that this book will provide support for those already extolling the 
virtues of the diet, and that it will offer valuable information to my colleagues 
and to everyone whose aim is a longer and healthier life. 
<P>
I hope that this first English edition will clear the way for a discussion of
(refined) carbohydrates as the cause for diseases of civilization.  This quest
is likely to succeed since the lipid theory, which has dominated the minds of
medical scientists for the past several decades, has dug its own grave.  The
huge and very costly epidemiological studies have indeed demonstrated that the
blood-cholesterol level is somehow prognostic for the occurrence of heart
attacks.
<P>
However, the subsequent intervention trials were hardly effective.  Apparently,
a diet poor in fat and cholesterol can lower the incidence of heart  attacks to 
a small degree but has little influence on the overall mortality.  A population 
which feeds on a diet that contradicts the  evolutionarily-evolved nutritional
composition will have to face many privations with little or no gain in health 
status.
<P>
We will have to leave the beaten track of animal fat and cholesterol restriction 
and remember that essentially we are still what we were when we emerged from the 
paleolithic era and began to conquer the earth: hunters, or at best hunters and 
gatherers.  Our physiology had no time to change fundamentally in the following 
few thousand years; our body is still adapted to the consumption of proteins and 
lipids. Consequently, the contemporary intake of (refined) carbohydrates is harmful  -- 
exceeding the amount a paleolithic gatherer could carry home.
<P>
I hope this English edition will help to change the minds of medical scientists
and eventually revise the nutritional views of the general population.
<P>
The best way of convincing a layman of the correctness of an idea is by an 
experiment Involving his own person.  I can give an almost certain promise that 
scarcely anyone will not discover some kind of improvement in his well-being.  
The physicians is in a  simple position, for he needs only incorporate this form 
of nutrition in his therapeutic  repertoire, and will  find that he has never
had so many grateful patients.
<P>
He will, however, have to reckon with difficulties. 
Again and again  I will point out that the effect of a low-carbohydrate diet 
is dependent upon two processes opposed to each other.  On the one hand, there is 
an improvement in the quality of tissues and organs and
on the other forces originating in the immune system are mobilized are directed
against the body's own organs  (auto-aggression).  Since, unbeknown to us,
immune diseases of this kind may be latent within us, it is strongly
recommended that a low (refined) carbohydrate diet should be supervised by a
physician if any disturbing symptoms exist or develop.
<P>
Since a  &quot;Life without Bread&quot; involves a number of medical measures I want to 
address myself at this point to my professional colleagues, particularly the
younger generation.  Perhaps with the eagerness for new ideas that is
characteristic of youth they may even be prepared to abandon the older
theories.  It is my hope and conviction that sooner or later clinics and
research establishments will approach research in human nutrition with an open 
mind, unhampered by preconceived ideas.  I have no doubt that an approach of
this kind would bring additional confirmation of the observations described in 
this book.  Despite the difficulties connected with a change
of diet in sick adults, a restriction of (refined) carbohydrate is in 
many cases the only hope left.  And furthermore it provides a basis for successful
treatment of diseases of civilization.
<P>
I appeal here to clinicians to collect exact data on their patients and in 
animal experiments.  It is not enough to talk about different types of diet and
to leave it to others to discover whether a particular diet leads to alterations 
in physiological values or brings improvements in health or even a prolongation 
of life.  Measurements of this kind are reported in this book.

Anyone who has found himself or herself in the position of an outsider trying to penetrate
the sacred precinct of established scientific theory will appreciate the 
difficulties that I have encountered.  That it was possible at all is due to Dr.
med. Erdmuthe Idris, who considered the manuscript of an unknown author to be
suitable for publication, thus bringing it to the notice of the German medical 
world.
<P>

As regards the scientific side of the work involved, I warmly acknowledge the 
cooperation of Prof.  Dr.  Jurgen Schole, Hannover, West Germany; 
of Dr.  Heinrich Iselstoger, Wien, Austria; 
and Prof.  Dr.  Kurt Eckel, Bad Ischl, and in particular the assistance of 
Prof.  Dr. Guenther Weitzel and Prof.  Dr. Eckhard Buddecke 
of the Institutes of Physiological Chemistry in Tuebingen and Munster (West 
Germany).  
In professor Weitzel I found a ready listener when, as a physician
completely unknown to him, I approached him with my idea that humans as well as 
chickens were led away from their original mode of nutrition with the 
introduction of carbohydrates by agriculture, and that this might be the
explanation for the similar forms of arteriosclerosis seen in the two species.  He willingly
and generously placed his experience and the facilities of his institute at my 
disposal.  Prof.  Buddecke has assisted me in the continuation and completion of
these experiments.

<P>
My thanks finally go to Mrs.  Beatrice Idris-Duncan, San Raphael, CA, USA; Mrs.
Joy Wieser, lnnsbruck, Austria, for this expert translation, and to Dr.  
Erdmuthe Idris Planegg near Munich.  Without her taking interest in this book it would not have
appeared.
