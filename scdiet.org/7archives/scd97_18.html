Subject:      scd and weaning off prednisone?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hello all --<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm a newcomer to the list as well as the SCD diet.  I've got UC, or possibly<BR>
Crohn's colitis (the M.D.s are going back and forth on the diagnosis).  I'd<BR>
gotten down to 5 mg of prednisone per day (plus 4800 mg. of asacol); then I<BR>
flared again, and am currently up to 20 mg of prednisone (plus asacol).  My<BR>
question is this: as of now, I'm fairly asymptomatic (2-3 stools per day, no<BR>
diarrhea, not much urgency, very littlle blood) -- if I start the diet now, when<BR>
the pred is putting me into remission, how will I know if the diet is working?<BR>
The book says I should know in a month, by the decrease in my symptomology; but<BR>
if I'm having less symptoms, how will I know whether to attribute this to the<BR>
diet or the prednisone?  Or, do I wait until I possibly flare again before<BR>
beginning the diet?  Any opinions or suggestions about this?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A couple of minor questions.  OK, soy milk is a no-no: what about rice milk?<BR>
almond milk?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks y'all.<BR>

&gt; &gt;Hi to all,<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;For those not follwing the news server (alt.support. ...), I am<BR>
&gt; &gt;posting this here as well.  I replied to someone wondering if<BR>
&gt; &gt;IBD is hereditary.  Here follows my message...<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;-----<BR>
&gt; &gt;In '83 I was the first to be diagnosed with Crohn's.  Since that time, two<BR>
&gt; &gt;of my mother's sisters got UC while in their 40's. Another sister's daughter<BR>
&gt; &gt;(my first cousin (female/23)) was diagnosed with CD in the past year.  I do<BR>
&gt; &gt;not believe CD and UC to be hereditary, however I believe we have a genetic<BR>
&gt; &gt;pre-disposition to getting such a disease along with environmental factors.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;I would like to share IMHO why I believe (based on my personal circumstances<BR>
&gt; &gt;and experiences) to have gotten Crohn's disease.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;You can make your own judgements based on your own experiences.  I do not<BR>
&gt; &gt;state here that these CAUSED CD, instead I state that they CONTRIBUTED to<BR>
&gt; &gt;getting CD with the genetic pre-disposition.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;   - my grandmother never breast-fed any of her 8 children<BR>
&gt; &gt;   - my mother never breastfed (as was &quot;the thing&quot; in her day)<BR>
&gt; &gt;   - my parents smoked up until I left for University<BR>
&gt; &gt;   - my family doctor prescribed Tetracycline for acne problem. This is<BR>
&gt; &gt;        strong wide-spectrum anti-biotic which kill off good germs as well.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;        *** all of the above lead to lower immune system to fight off disease<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;   - poor eating habits as a teenager<BR>
&gt; &gt;   - too much SUGAR (such as daily drinking of Kool-aid -- BIGGEST MISTAKE)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; THAT I'LL WHOLE-HEARTEDLY AGREE WITH.  I was a MAJOR sugar junkie from age<BR>
&gt; 5 for about 36 years (finally stopped, I hope, about 5 months ago).  Eating<BR>
&gt; sugar always made me bleed, once I figured out the connection.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Also, studies have been done of people with colitis that showed their<BR>
&gt; consumption of sweets is about 2x the &quot;norm&quot;.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; You figure it out ... makes sense?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; If anyone wants to discuss HOW sugar wreaks such havoc, we could tackle<BR>
&gt; this topic sometimes ...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;   - drank too much milk while doing weight-training<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;        *** these lead to yeast and bacteria build-up in the colon which then<BR>
&gt; &gt;        moves upp into the lower bowel to feed on the undigested sugars and<BR>
&gt; &gt;        starches.  The parts on the intestinal wall which should break these<BR>
&gt; &gt;        down are damaged by lower immune system.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;So if you have read some of my previous posts, you know that I know strongly<BR>
&gt; &gt;believe that diet plays a major role in the healing process.  It cost me two<BR>
&gt; &gt;operations and 40 inches of bowel to learn this lesson.  Change of diet to<BR>
&gt; &gt;simple sugars will no longer feed the yeast and bacteria, them allowing my<BR>
&gt; &gt;system to rebuild itself.  Vitamins help rebuild immune system.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;There's my two-cents worth on the subject.  Think about your situation<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Let me know what you think, and your situation before Crohn's and UC.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Good work, Dan.  And, yeah, too bad it took you so long to figure it out,<BR>
&gt; but then, we're all in the same boat ... some of us are at least lucky<BR>
&gt; enough to find these &quot;alternative&quot; info resources liks this group!<BR>
&gt;<BR>

&gt; &gt;It seems obvious to me, following this line of reason, that eating an<BR>
abundance of sugar could have been a triggering factor in acquiring our<BR>
illnesses.  Sugar, being a complex carb, requires &quot;work&quot; for the cells<BR>
to break them down.  It's like running a car in a low gear for a great<BR>
distance, eventually something has got to give.  I've been a mass<BR>
consumer of sweet cereals as a kid (and adult), which consists of milk,<BR>
grain and sugar.  Imagine the work required to absorb all that!<BR>

        Subject: Relapse<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have ulcerative colitis and have been on the diet since April 26, 1997.<BR>
I did really well and was symptom free after less than one month.  That<BR>
lasted for about two weeks.  Now I've gone into a relapse which has lasted<BR>
about three weeks.  It seems to be getting steadily worse but I can't<BR>
figure out why.  I know the book talks about a relapse after two to three<BR>
months but how long is this relapse supposed to last?  I'm on mesasol pills<BR>
and salofalk suppositories, has anyone else had success with these?<BR>
Thanks for any ideas.  Sonya<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Hi and welcome.  I started the diet the same time as I started taking<BR>
Prednisone and other medications and I know the diet helped me.  The<BR>
Prednisone and the other medications helped me at the time due to my bad<BR>
flare up.  As my doctor said &quot;you can't put out a fire with a glass of<BR>
water, that is why I am putting you on medication&quot;.  My doctor is the<BR>
doctor who wrote the forward to Elaine's book, his name is Dr. Hoffman.  I<BR>
slowly got off all medication in about a three month period only, because I<BR>
was doing so well.  I would definitely start the diet right away.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A couple of minor questions.  OK, soy milk is a no-no: what about rice<BR>
milk?<BR>
almond milk?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rice milk is another NO-NO!  We are not allowed to have any starch.  I<BR>
tried the almond milk and it bothered me I really don't know if it is<BR>
allowed, but I stay away from the almond milk.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>

Hi!  I am sorry to hear about the relapse.  Have you tried the diet again<BR>
from the beginning?  I know when I have had symptoms of the Crohn's acting<BR>
up I go write back to the beginning of the diet.<BR>

Mime-Version: 1.0<BR>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;us-ascii&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        From my experience, juicing did NOT work for me. After reading Barry<BR>
Sears' book &quot;The Zone&quot; I understood WHY (it used to run through me like<BR>
water through a city water main!).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's because you're dumping a high volume of concentrated &quot;refined&quot;<BR>
carbohydrates (&quot;refined&quot; in the sense that you've stripped it of all its<BR>
natural attendant material, like the fibres) into the system; people with<BR>
IBD (well, at least me!) apparently can not tolerate the sudden onslaught<BR>
of highly-concentrated CHO's ... their small &amp; large bowel simply don't<BR>
absorb the water etc. out of it fast enough because the mucosal lining is<BR>
inflamed (I'm again talking for someone like myself here, who has colitis,<BR>
but it can also /especially apply for Crohnies because 90% of the stool's<BR>
water is absorbed in the healthy small bowel).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So in case anybody tries juicing (esp. fruits, veggies may work a bit<BR>
better, but I wouldn't count on it ... again, you're concentrating the<BR>
natural sugars and not letting them be carried in their natural &quot;cradle&quot; of<BR>
the undigestible fibres, etc.) and it does NOT work, here may be the<BR>
explanation why.  Try it &amp; see for yourself.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Hi,<BR>
&gt;I have just joined the SCD List after hearing about it from one of your<BR>
&gt;members, Barb, here in FL.  I have a continuing very puzzling intestinal<BR>
&gt;problem(s) about which I have been going to doctors for 7 1/2 years,<BR>
&gt;currently going to Shands Hospital in Gainesville, FL.  About every test in<BR>
&gt;the book has been run and the only things showing up are chronic pancreatitis<BR>
&gt;- my pancreas does not produce any enzymes at all - and malabsorption.  I<BR>
&gt;literally now can not eat any solid foods of any sort or drink anything but<BR>
&gt;water.  I am on IV feeding 12 hours a night (TPN - total parenteral<BR>
&gt;nutrition) - absolute necessity; I was becoming skin and bones, having lost<BR>
&gt;almost 50 lbs.  Biopsies from intestines show no Crohn's or Celiac disease or<BR>
&gt;any inflammatory diseases.  I just had a monitoring test done of the motility<BR>
&gt;of the intestinal tract (a tube with monitor run down to my small intestine<BR>
&gt;for 24 hours - a miserable test to endure) and it showed &quot;abnormal&quot; in<BR>
&gt;preliminary viewing, I won't know full results till I go back on the 14th.<BR>
&gt; They administered 3 different medications at various intervals to track the<BR>
&gt;effects and to see if they would help the condition; two I had allergic<BR>
&gt;reactions to, the third is a shot which I would have to give each day if the<BR>
&gt;printouts show it helps.<BR>
&gt;I have had Irritable Bowel Syndrome for years and years, not realizing what<BR>
&gt;it was till about 12 years ago.  I have always had food sensitivities but<BR>
&gt;food allergy tests show no positive results (no positive results on any<BR>
&gt;allergy test).  At any rate, this condition has gotten progressively worse<BR>
&gt;and has the doctors baffled, also, since I evidently am not showing<BR>
&gt;&quot;classical&quot; symptons.  They don't know whether this motility factor is a<BR>
&gt;result of or a cause of my chronic diarrhea.<BR>
&gt;I've been reading everything I can find on intestinal disorders causing<BR>
&gt;diarrhea.  I have Elaine Gottschall's book and have been reading it.  I am<BR>
&gt;willing to try anything.  I do have a real problem digesting any fats (ever<BR>
&gt;since I can remember) and a lactose intolerance.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
1) What do you mean by &quot;a real problem&quot;???<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2) What type of fats do you normally eat that give you problems?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3) Do you take these fats in a diet that also contains starches/grains/sugars?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I currently have two<BR>
&gt;medications to take:  Prilosec and Creon 20 (digestive enzymes).<BR>
&gt;What I would like to know, from someone who has gone through it, is what of<BR>
&gt;the foods given in her lists should I attempt to start trying and how best to<BR>
&gt;do this.  In reading her book in the start list she gives eggs but farther on<BR>
&gt;she mentions not using these till later.  I really would like to hear from<BR>
&gt;anyone who has made a transition from IV (TPN) feeding to starting on her<BR>
&gt;diet and how best to do this.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Slowly.  I did it this Jan/Feb during my 5-week hospitalizaton for severe<BR>
bout of colitis ... I convinced my MD &amp; the dietician to let ME be in<BR>
charge of my food planning there, and NOT to give me their usual intro diet<BR>
of jello, milk, tea, soya milkshake, apple juice, and toast etc.  (you<BR>
know, all that good industrial so-called &quot;food&quot; crap!).  Instead I started<BR>
with pureed vegetables (non-starchy ones, i.e. no potatoes, yams, etc. ...<BR>
cilantro &amp; broccoli &amp; carrots worked quite well), sort of like baby food,<BR>
and easy on the spicing (I prefer none), with either avocadoe, olive oil,<BR>
or butter as fat.  I ate that 3x/day, and slowly added in other foods (i.e.<BR>
non-pureed veggies, then a 1/2 apple, etc).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was before i was applying Elaine's methods, only usng my ND's advice,<BR>
so I started eating bread &amp; potatoes eventually, too ... now I know I<BR>
shouldn't have, but it wasn't too too bad in any case.  Next time around<BR>
I'd stay away from those, too, though.<BR>
        <BR>
&gt;You can email me at        LLBSchn@aol.com<BR>
&gt;I really want to get back on some regular food but have had absolutely no<BR>
&gt;luck so far.  My intestinal tract goes wild any time I try.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Lori<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Small portions of the above-mentioned stuff, too. Check out Peter<BR>
d'Adamo's Book &quot;Eat Right for Your Type: 4 blood types, 4 diets&quot; to see if<BR>
you are OK to eat meat, or if you're the grains type, then modify the diet<BR>
as necessary.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Try adding some fats (like butter, olive oil, fish oil) to your diet (don't<BR>
be afraid of it ... only if you get &quot;steatorrhea&quot;, fat floating in the<BR>
stools, will you know you're on the wrong track, but my expectation is you<BR>
will NOT have that happen).  I'm currently doing that (I was in similar<BR>
position as you), and it seems to be working well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I won't go into the complex explanation here (I've been pondering the<BR>
problem of colitis for 30 years, having had it since about age 12, and<BR>
finally about 1 month ago made some (what I feel) are good new insights.<BR>
It revolved around the concept of acidity vs. alkalinity in the bowel, and<BR>
the pancreas.  As I said, I won't go into the details here, but try it and<BR>
see if it works ...<BR>

Also, read Wolfgang Lutz's book which will be coming on-line @ Mik's site<BR>

&gt;I know the book talks about a relapse after two to three<BR>

Hi Everyone,<BR>

Can anyone give me the brand name of a multi-vitamin that fits the scd<BR>
diet?  I mean that has no forbidden addatives such as sugars, etc.<BR>

Hello,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regarding the replase:  you may want to refine the diet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I found that I needed to eliminate foods that are &quot;OK&quot; according to<BR>
Elaine's guidelines, but *not* OK according to my experience.    Another<BR>
book, &quot;Eating Right for a Bad Gut&quot; book by Scala is a more conventional<BR>
review of what foods a UC/CD sufferer may want to avoid.   Scala has done<BR>
informal surveys of UC/CD patients to determine what foods consistently<BR>
cause problems, and some of the findings coincide with my experience,<BR>
thought they are allowed on the SCD.   Personally, I have maintained the<BR>
SCD guidelines, but I also cut out red meat, beets (including V8 juice),<BR>
some fruits, all unpeeled vegetables.    I especially want to stress the<BR>
red meat: the last three times I have tried a steak or burger, I was on my<BR>
back the next day with the usual symptoms.   These &quot;beef&quot; episodes came<BR>
during periods of relatively good health.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I also want to make a plug for garlic capsules - I take two a day and on<BR>
days when I run out or forget, I definitely feel worse.  (Caution - garlic<BR>
is supposedly upsetting to some people with our condition.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I think the diet continues to be factor in my current good health.   But<BR>
I'm convinced we all must seek additional parameters based on our<BR>
experience.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Best of luck!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill<BR>

Hi<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle, Elaine mentions vitamins sold<BR>
by Freeda Vitamins Inc.  They are located in New York and their number<BR>
is 1-800-777-3737.  I have been using them myself.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There was a recent message about bowel disease running in families.  I<BR>
think that the term applied is that it is familial.  There are patterens<BR>
found in families but the medical community stops short of saying that<BR>
it is inherited.  In our local support group we have several families<BR>
with multiple occurrences.<BR>

Hi:  Ihave been on SCD for 2 months.  I have lost 25lbs and my complexion<BR>
is drastically improved, but most of all I feel much better.  I have a lot<BR>
more energy.  My doctor knows I am on this diet but does not believe it<BR>
will make a difference.  I am on Imovan and he is weaning me off of<BR>
predisone.  I want to thank everyone for their input.  I have told a couple<BR>
people locally about Elaine's book.  I wouldn't say I'm symptom free, but I<BR>
am much better.  I want to share with the group how I improved the muffins<BR>
which love.  Instead of adding three eggs to the muffins I add 1 egg and 3<BR>
egg yolks.  I then take the 3 egg whites and beat till stiff.  After all<BR>
the other ingredients have been mixed together I fold in the egg whites and<BR>
then bake.  This makes the muffins lighter.  I've also made up many<BR>
receipes that conform to this diet.  My 12 year old says that the food eat<BR>
tastes much better than before SCD.<BR>

&gt; KarenSHOW US THE RECIPES!  SHOW US THE RECIPES!! We want more recipes!  I<BR>
like your muffin idea.  I usually add in more nut flour just at the end<BR>
before baking, which makes them denser, and firmer (If you mix well).<BR>
But, to each his own!  I'll have to try the &quot;lighter side&quot; of muffins<BR>
next time (which will be tonite!)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I lke hearing these positive stories of personal experience.  It reminds<BR>
me that the diet is working for me and I remain grateful for this<BR>
opportunity to live a more comfortable existence.  (I've swapped out<BR>
some of my hobbies, instead of practicing the guitar and making music, I<BR>
cook a lot and shop for food in odd places!  It's less frustrating, but<BR>
a bit more expensive!)<BR>

        I too would like to0 thank Karen. Please send any recipe ideas. That is<BR>
what this list is all about. The diet, remember?<BR>
I like to hear how you all are doing on the diet and when a particular food<BR>
does good or bad. I, myself am doing fine. The only problem I seem to have<BR>
is with gas. It's not a great deal, but enough to keep me on the run so to<BR>
speak. I have found that cheese and some veges(artochokes) are culprits. I<BR>
wouldn't go near the old beans. But aside from the always present bleeding,<BR>
I do feel fine.<BR>
        I made the carrot &quot;cake&quot; from the recipe list that was postede a few days<BR>
ago. It's a bit eggy, but pretty amazing  really.I still need munchy stuff.<BR>
I too have enjoyed preparing food and shop with a different eye these days.<BR>
        Be healthy. Stick to it. Seeya..........Bill<BR>

Hello everybody,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For those of you who remember when I was going through yogurt<BR>
difficulties, adjusting temperature, etc, well, I finally got to the<BR>
bottom of it.  I just plain and simple can't tolerate dairy products, an<BR>
allergy, I believe.  This is major news for me because being on the scd<BR>
for almost five months, I've used the cheese as a major source of<BR>
protein and now I am realizing it is what has contributed to many of my<BR>
lingering health issues.  Those being, eczema, fatigue and a wired<BR>
feeling that has resulted in quite a bit of insomnia for me over the<BR>
years.  Since stopping the cheese, my face is distinctively less red and<BR>
flaky and I am sleeping SO well.  I just wanted to let you all know<BR>
about this.  I guess not all dairy allergies are dramatic.  Personally,<BR>
I can get a reaction 72 hours after I've eaten some, so it's been tricky<BR>
to figure out that the cheese was the problem.  Well, wonders never<BR>
cease.  I'm planning to have some allergy testing done to see what else<BR>
I may be allergic to.  A special thanks to Mik for his article on<BR>
lactose intollerance vs. food allergy recently!!<BR>

Hi Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After some experimentation, I've found that I just can't tolerate yogurt<BR>
made using commercial yogurt as a starter.  Yogormet as a starter works<BR>
well for me -- No gas.   My guess is that commercial yogurt may be weak one<BR>
or more of the different strains of lactobacillius, while the freeze dried<BR>
isn't.  I'm not sure -- any opinions?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I do wonder if the little bit of sucrose it contains has any negative<BR>
effects, but unless I find an alternative, I think I'll stick with it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone know of a mail order source for any brand of starter?  I live<BR>
in the boonies and none of the health food stores in the area carry it.<BR>

Hi!  I would like to say that I am very happy that the group is up and<BR>
running.  I think that this group is the best thing going.  I was in such<BR>
terrible shape 7 months ago.  I can't believe how great I feel from this<BR>
diet.  I thank GOD everyday for Elaine and her book and Dr. Hoffman for<BR>
introducing me to the book.  I have NO pain in the gut anymore and I don't<BR>
run to the bathroom 10 times a day anymore.  The bleeding also stopped<BR>
about 3 weeks into the diet.  I also noticed that my breath doesn't stink<BR>
anymore.  I also gained alot of my weight back 34 pounds in total.  Well<BR>
it's time to go, I wish the best to all keep the faith.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Hello<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the diet for about 4 weeks and I still can't tolerate<BR>
yogurt.  Everytime I try even just a little bit my system goes hay<BR>
wire.  Do you think the commercial yogurt is having an effect on my<BR>
system.  Should I try the freeze dried starter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any comments would be appreciated.<BR>

Hi everyone!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I got the article by Wolfgang Lutz in the Munich Medical Journal lately<BR>
and I thought you might be interested in the abstract that is given in<BR>
English. In general the article states that a low (not particularly a<BR>
specific) carbohydrate diet helps most crohn`s and colitis sufferers<BR>
remarkably. Unfortunately the article does not contain any details about<BR>
the prescribed diet or forbidden foods.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And I want to refer you to a website I came across which is a very<BR>
thorough collection of material about a possible cause of IBD:<BR>
Mycobacteria (paratubercolosis and avium).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Abstract:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Low-Carbohydrate Diet in Crohn's Disease:<BR>
A Low-Carbohydrate Diet (72 g/24 h) has a very favourable effect on<BR>
pa-tients with Crohn's disease. Symptoms and signs tend to subside after<BR>
6 months in 70, after one year in 80 and after 1 1/2 years in 90% of the<BR>
instances. Obviously there is no tendency of relapses, contrary to<BR>
ulcerative colitis which also reacts to this diet favourably. Since<BR>
nearly all gastrointestinal patients tend to accelerate the passage of<BR>
ingesta through their intestines, the idea arises that ingesta not fully<BR>
degraded are &quot;persorbed&quot; in the terminal ileum and cause allergic<BR>
reactions with granulomatous lesions typical for Crohn's disease.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I don`t write very often but I appreciate very much what everyone on the<BR>
list contributes. My experience is that we can only help ourselves<BR>
because most of the doctors know less than we do about our disease.<BR>
<BR>

&lt;P&gt;<BR>
&lt;H2&gt;Introduction.&lt;/H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Since Crohn's disease was first recognised in the early part of the twent=<BR>
ieth century, it has been theorised that the disease is caused by a bacte=<BR>
rial infection, with the principal suspect being mycobacteria, and more s=<BR>
pecifically in recent times, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. Recently, re=<BR>
search is making advances in understanding this organism, and is indicati=<BR>
ng more and more that at least some cases of Crohn's disease, if not all,=<BR>
 are caused by paratuberculosis infection. Most importantly, Crohn's pati=<BR>
ents have been cured by antibiotic treatment which has activity against M=<BR>
ycobacterium paratuberculosis.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
This is an important question for sufferers of the disease, because the b=<BR>
acterium in question is endemic in dairy foods and water supplies in most=<BR>
 areas of the western world. In order to facilitate self-education about =<BR>
this question, I have put together this web site, which contains most of =<BR>
the relevant medical research. The information is broken down into variou=<BR>

&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=3D&quot;mycobacteria&quot;&gt;What are mycobacteria?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Mycobacteria are a species of &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;PRIMER/bacteria.htm&quot;&gt;bacteria&lt;/A=<BR>
&gt;. There are many different species of mycobacteria, widely spread throug=<BR>
hout the environment. They are broken into three main groups.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
&lt;UL&gt;<BR>
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;non-pathogenic mycobacteria&lt;/B&gt;, are usually harmless to humans, a=<BR>
nd exist in the global environment without human interaction.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;obligate pathogenic mycobacteria&lt;/B&gt; (i.e. known to cause disease)=<BR>
 mycobacteria, cause disease in humans and other animals. Also, they requ=<BR>
ire the benign environment of a host animal to multiply. Well known examp=<BR>
les of  pathogenic mycobacterial disease in humans are tuberculosis and l=<BR>
eprosy. Disease caused by these obligate pathogen organisms is always chr=<BR>
onic (long-lasting), since they take long periods of time to multiply, an=<BR>
d are difficult to eradicate. Not all humans mount a successful immune re=<BR>
sponse to these mycobacteria, and they can be fatal in those people if un=<BR>
treated.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;potential pathogenic mycobacteria&lt;/B&gt;,  can exist in the environme=<BR>
nt independent of humans but can also cause disease if the immune defence=<BR>
s of the host they infect are impaired or suppressed. These potential pat=<BR>
hogens are often referred to as &lt;B&gt;opportunistic pathogens&lt;/B&gt;, because t=<BR>
hey become pathogenic when presented with the right opportunity.<BR>
&lt;/UL&gt;<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is an obligate pathogen, i.e. it cannot mu=<BR>
ltiply outside the cells of animals. It is known to cause disease in a wi=<BR>
de variety of animals, including primates. See the page &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;animal=<BR>
=2Ehtm&quot;&gt;&quot;Mycobacterium Paratuberculosis in Animals&quot;&lt;/A&gt; for more informat=<BR>
ion. In common with other obligate pathogens, the environment required by=<BR>
 Mycobacterium paratuberculosis for multiplying is the environment found =<BR>
inside mammals and other animals. In animals, the most common site for in=<BR>
fection by Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is the gastrointestinal tract, =<BR>
where it tends to cause a chronic inflammatory disease. The most well stu=<BR>
died animal paratuberculosis is Johne's disease, the name given to the di=<BR>
sease as seen in cattle. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis occurs in two for=<BR>
ms, the &lt;B&gt;bacillary&lt;/B&gt; form and the &lt;B&gt;spheroplast&lt;/B&gt; form. Many parat=<BR>
uberculosis bacteria of the bacillary form may be required to cause clini=<BR>
cal disease. In contrast, only a few paratuberculosis bacteria of the sph=<BR>
eroplast form will cause disease. This difference between diseases caused=<BR>
 by the two forms of paratuberculosis is a result of the infected hosts i=<BR>
mmune reaction.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Whether Mycobacterium paratuberculosis causes disease in humans has been =<BR>
a question for researchers for over a hundred years, since the organism w=<BR>
as first discovered in 1895, causing disease in a german cow. Since that =<BR>
time, paratuberculosis has been recognised in many species of animals, in=<BR>
 both its bacillary and spheroplast forms. The bacillary form is easily d=<BR>
etected in animals, since it grows in large numbers and is identifiable b=<BR>
y a simple chemical test. In contrast, the spheroplast form, since it com=<BR>
es in only very small numbers and cannot be easily be identified, was not=<BR>
 detected until the advent of modern genetic testing techniques.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>

re available in the paper &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;paratub.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;Mycobacteria and the a=<BR>

&lt;H3&gt;&lt;A NAME=3D&quot;avium&quot;&gt;Mycobacterium avium.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Mycobacterium avium is an opportunistic pathogen, and comes in two forms,=<BR>
 the bacillary and spheroplast form. Both of these forms can cause diseas=<BR>
e in animals. The spheroplast form also causes disease in humans. The peo=<BR>
ple who most often contract disease from Mycobacterium avium are sufferer=<BR>
s from AIDS, whose immune systems have been suppressed by the HIV virus. =<BR>
In immunocompromised people, Mycobacterium avium invades the white blood =<BR>
cells of the infected person, and uses them as sites to multiply.<BR>

&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=3D&quot;where&quot;&gt;Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in dairy foods and w=<BR>
ater supplies.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is present in the food chain, through the =<BR>
medium of dairy products from cattle infected by the organism. Cows with =<BR>
bovine paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) are known to secrete Mycobacter=<BR>
ium paratuberculosis in their milk. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is not=<BR>
 destroyed by standard milk pasteurisation techniques. See the page &lt;A HR=<BR>
EF=3D&quot;milk.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;Mycobacterium Paratuberculosis in Cows Milk&quot;&lt;/A&gt; for mor=<BR>
e information.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is not killed by standard HTST pasteurizat=<BR>
ion. This is true for other pathogenic bacteria that can potentially infe=<BR>
ct HTST-pasteurized milk. For this reason, sufferers of Crohns disease an=<BR>
d other Inflammatory Bowel Diseases should consider switching to UHT milk=<BR>
, which is much more effective at destroying bacteria. See the page &lt;A HR=<BR>

cts&quot;&lt;/A&gt; for more information.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
As stated in the paper, &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;greenst.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;On the Etiology of Crohn=<BR>
 Disease&quot;&lt;/A&gt;, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis has also been cultured from=<BR>
 the municipal water supply of a major city in the United States. See the=<BR>

&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=3D&quot;what&quot;&gt;What is Crohn's disease?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Crohns disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal =<BR>
tract. Its affects hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Its =<BR>
cause is unknown. The disease is autoimmune in nature, i.e. it causes the=<BR>
 immune system to attack and inflame the bodies own tissues, most often i=<BR>
n the gastrointestinal tract, but also in other parts of the body. When t=<BR>
he disease is active in a patient, treatments include long term administr=<BR>
ation of immunosuppressive drugs and surgery, involving removal of segmen=<BR>
ts of the damaged bowel, and sometimes the fitting of ostomy bags. Two of=<BR>
 the main drug treatments are steroids, often in high doses, which have a=<BR>
n immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory effect and &quot;6-MP&quot; based drugs, whic=<BR>
h suppress the action of the immune system, and are used after organ tran=<BR>
splant surgery to prevent rejection of transplanted organs.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
&lt;HR&gt;<BR>
&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=3D&quot;similar&quot;&gt;The similarity of Crohn's disease to mycobacteria=<BR>
l diseases.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
The symptoms of Crohn's disease are extremely similar to symptoms of dise=<BR>
ases caused by known pathogenic mycobacteria, particularly intestinal tub=<BR>
erculosis, caused by the obligate pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. S=<BR>
o much so, that intestinal tuberculosis is often misdiagnosed as Crohn's =<BR>
disease. This confusion is contributed to by the fact that there a degree=<BR>
 of commonality of treatments between the two diseases. For a comparison =<BR>
of the symptoms of known mycobacterial diseases and Crohn's disease, and =<BR>
discussion of the known commonalities between the two diseases in terms o=<BR>
f diagnosis and treatment, see the page &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;similar.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;Similari=<BR>
ties between Crohn's disease and mycobacterial disease.&quot;&lt;/A&gt;.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Also, there is evidence that Crohn's disease presents in two main forms, =<BR>
the aggressive &quot;perforating&quot; form and the contained &quot;nonperforating&quot; form=<BR>
=2E This is a feature that Crohn's disease shares with the mycobacterial =<BR>
disease &lt;B&gt;leprosy&lt;/B&gt;, which also presents in two forms, the aggressive =<BR>
&quot;lepromatous&quot; form and the contained &quot;tuberculoid&quot; form. See the page &lt;A =<BR>
HREF=3D&quot;polar.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;The polar manifestations of mycobacterial diseases an=<BR>
d of Crohn's disease&quot;&lt;/A&gt; for more details.<BR>

&lt;HR&gt;<BR>
&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=3D&quot;history&quot;&gt;History and milestones of Research.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Crohn's disease was first recognised by a Glasgow surgeon, Dalziel, in 19=<BR>
13. He recognised that it was a different disease from intestinal tubercu=<BR>
losis, but believed that it was so similar to that disease, and to paratu=<BR>
berculosis in cows, that it must have a mycobacterial cause. He failed to=<BR>
 prove this connection, because of the inability to demonstrate visible b=<BR>
acteria from tissue samples. In 1932, Crohn et al., on the basis of this =<BR>
same inability to demonstrate visible bacteria, classified the disease as=<BR>
 not having a mycobacterial origin. Nonetheless, this classification was =<BR>
not universally accepted, and research into whether Crohn's disease is in=<BR>
volved with Mycobacterium paratuberculosis has been carried out since the=<BR>
n. See the page &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;history.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;History of early research on Cro=<BR>
hn's disease&quot;&lt;/A&gt; for a description of early research and the work of Cro=<BR>
hn et al.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
An important milestone in paratuberculosis research in recent years was t=<BR>
he discovery in 1985 of a genetic code (&lt;A HREF=3D&quot;PRIMER/bactid.htm&quot;&gt;the=<BR>
 IS900 insertion sequence&lt;/A&gt;) that is unique to Mycobacterium paratuberc=<BR>
ulosis. The sequence is found in both the bacillary and spheroplast forms=<BR>
 of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techn=<BR>
iques make it possible to detect small numbers of Mycobacterium paratuber=<BR>
culosis against the background of other DNA signals present in the human =<BR>
body. Knowledge of this sequence permits researchers to state with certai=<BR>
nty (depending on the care with which this highly complex test is conduct=<BR>
ed) whether the organism is present in any given sample. It also permits =<BR>
them to rule out the presence of other forms of mycobacteria.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
In December 1994, attention was drawn to the fact that Crohn's disease, i=<BR>
n common with known mycobacterial diseases, is not a uniform disease and =<BR>
may present in two main forms, the &lt;B&gt;&quot;perforating&quot;&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;&quot;nonperfor=<BR>
ating&quot;&lt;/B&gt; forms. See the page &lt;A HREF=3D&quot;polar.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;The polar manifesta=<BR>
tions of mycobacterial diseases and of Crohn's disease&quot;&lt;/A&gt;, for a detail=<BR>
ed discussion of this. No research to date has considered this division.<BR>

&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=3D&quot;recent&quot;&gt;Important recent research.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
Two recently published papers provide solid evidence that Mycobacterium p=<BR>
aratuberculosis is involved in at least a proportion of Crohn's disease. =<BR>
Most notably, treatment with a multi-drug antibiotic regime which is acti=<BR>
ve against intracellular forms of mycobacteria resulted in remission in a=<BR>
 large majority of Crohn's patients.<BR>

&lt;LI&gt;A large majority (93.5%) of Crohn's disease patients treated with a m=<BR>

&lt;LI&gt;A possible explanation for the failure of clinical trials to prove th=<BR>

First, make sure you're using whole (3.25%) homo milk, just the normal<BR>
stuff ... not skim, not 2%, not anything else.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Second, make sure you're NOT adding milk powder to it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Third, make sure you're fermenting it AT LEAST 24 hours.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fourth, yes, DO use the freeze-dried starter at least for the first batch;<BR>
after that you could use some tablespoons from the batch as your new<BR>
starter, or use the bought powder again ... both work fine for us.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Question: what equipment are you using to ferment it?  Home-made, or<BR>
store-bought?<BR>

&gt; Hello everybody,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; For those of you who remember when I was going through yogurt<BR>
&gt; difficulties, adjusting temperature, etc, well, I finally got to the<BR>
&gt; bottom of it.  I just plain and simple can't tolerate dairy products, an<BR>
&gt; allergy, I believe.  This is major news for me because being on the scd<BR>
&gt; for almost five months, I've used the cheese as a major source of<BR>
&gt; protein and now I am realizing it is what has contributed to many of my<BR>
&gt; lingering health issues.  Those being, eczema, fatigue and a wired<BR>
&gt; feeling that has resulted in quite a bit of insomnia for me over the<BR>
&gt; years.  Since stopping the cheese, my face is distinctively less red and<BR>
&gt; flaky and I am sleeping SO well.  I just wanted to let you all know<BR>
&gt; about this.  I guess not all dairy allergies are dramatic.  Personally,<BR>
&gt; I can get a reaction 72 hours after I've eaten some, so it's been tricky<BR>
&gt; to figure out that the cheese was the problem.  Well, wonders never<BR>
&gt; cease.  I'm planning to have some allergy testing done to see what else<BR>
&gt; I may be allergic to.  A special thanks to Mik for his article on<BR>
&gt; lactose intollerance vs. food allergy recently!!<BR>

Subject:      fiber, cholesterol, colon cancer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm about to embark on the diet, but I have some concerns about it as a<BR>
long-term (more than a couple of months) eating plan.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My cholesterol tends to get high, but I can control it through diet, namely a<BR>
diet consisting of high fiber, especially oat bran.  If I keep my fat intake to<BR>
20% or so and eat 1/2 cup of oat bran per day (in muffins, cereal, or whatever)<BR>
I seem to be able to keep my cholesterol below 190.  This is important for me as<BR>
heart disease runs in my family.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Elaine's diet seems to be -- or could be, I guess is more accurate -- fairly<BR>
high in saturated fats (animal fats), and cholesterol.  There's a lot of eggs<BR>
and cheese involved, not to mention meats.  This makes it pretty hard to<BR>
regulate your cholesterol.   She says it's possible to be a vegetarian on her<BR>
diet, but it would seem to be quite difficult, as complex carbohydrates are<BR>
basically prohibited, and these are important to complement the proteins in<BR>
legumes (the only vegetable proteins that seem to be allowed).  I'm not a<BR>
vegetarian, particularly, but I've found eating a near-vegetarian diet to be an<BR>
excellent means of keeping my saturated fats low while getting enough protein.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any thoughts on this problem?  I'm 54 years old, and while IBD (they're not sure<BR>
if it's UC or Crohn's colitis) is certainly a major health issue, it probably<BR>
won't kill me -- and a heart attack very well might.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then there's the colon cancer problem, important generally but especially so for<BR>
those of us with colitis.  It's known that a low-fat high-fiber (whole grains<BR>
again) diet lowers the risk factors for colon cancer.  It would seem that<BR>
Elaine's diet would be higher risk in this regard.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
I'm about to embark on the diet, but some questions remain as to details:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Are the following forbidden on the diet?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Black beans<BR>
        Red beans (kidney beans)<BR>
        Metamucil<BR>
        Alfalfa sprouts (or other sprouts)  (I know bean sprouts are out)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why are garbanzos (chick peas) forbidden, but not white beans or lentils or<BR>
split peas?  What's the principle here?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why almond milk only after 6 months?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is there any way to communicate with Elaine directly to get authoritative<BR>
information about these kinds of details?<BR>
<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Hi Everyone,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; After some experimentation, I've found that I just can't tolerate yogurt<BR>
&gt; made using commercial yogurt as a starter.  Yogormet as a starter works<BR>
&gt; well for me -- No gas.   My guess is that commercial yogurt may be weak<BR>
one<BR>
&gt; or more of the different strains of lactobacillius, while the freeze<BR>
dried<BR>
&gt; isn't.  I'm not sure -- any opinions?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I do wonder if the little bit of sucrose it contains has any negative<BR>
&gt; effects, but unless I find an alternative, I think I'll stick with it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Does anyone know of a mail order source for any brand of starter?  I live<BR>
&gt; in the boonies and none of the health food stores in the area carry it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Thanks,<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Oh yea, would anyone be interested in starting a life without potato<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Hi Bill<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The commercial yogurt is a poor starter,  likely all the culture is dead<BR>
long before it was ever placed on the store shelf.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You didnt mention where on the continent you reside Bill , so I am not sure<BR>
you if you can obtain the starter I use called  &quot;rosell&quot;  (all small case )<BR>
Made in Montreal. I believe it to have a decidedly better taste than the<BR>
Yogormet starter. But then each to his own, after all taste is all in our<BR>
mouth.<BR>
The rosell is readly available in health food stores or I can give you the<BR>
address of the manufacture if you desire . I have used it for four years<BR>
and enjoy .<BR>
<BR>

Hi Lori:<BR>

<BR>
Commercial yogurt is of no value to anyone of us on the SCD.<BR>
 As well just a short time ago there was an exellent post stating you<BR>
CANNOT trust labels.<BR>
 The question begs what is in the commercial yogurt if you CAN NOT trust<BR>
labels?<BR>
If we are not aware of which foods we consume, the SCD is rather pointless.<BR>

Hi Anna and the group<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You can if you will add me to that list of never using commercial starter<BR>
Anna.<BR>
However I do prefer th 2% of all the milks. I find the whole , or even half<BR>
and half is just too rich for for my taste buds. Again it becomes a matter<BR>
of taste for most I imagine. One more point in buying milk is the<BR>
container. I choose to buy only the waxed carton. The reason being the<BR>
clear plastic bottle allows the rays from the neon lighting in the display<BR>
case to destroy some of the vit. D that has been add to the milk.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Certainly pleased to see the list up and running agn. with so many<BR>
contributing to it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good Health<BR>

I have been on the diet for about 4 weeks and have not been able to<BR>
tolerate any milk products, however, I knew before that I had a milk<BR>
protein intolerance.  I was hoping that following this diet would<BR>
eventually allow me to eat yogurt, etc.  I thought this only because<BR>
I could not eat eggs before and now I am able to!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don't get your hopes up about allergy testing - the doctors are not<BR>
very sympathetic to food allergies.<BR>

&gt;My cholesterol tends to get high, but I can control it through diet, namely a<BR>
&gt;diet consisting of high fiber, especially oat bran.  If I keep my fat<BR>
intake to<BR>
&gt;20% or so and eat 1/2 cup of oat bran per day (in muffins, cereal, or<BR>
whatever)<BR>
&gt;I seem to be able to keep my cholesterol below 190.  This is important for<BR>
me as<BR>
&gt;heart disease runs in my family.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Elaine's diet seems to be -- or could be, I guess is more accurate -- fairly<BR>
&gt;high in saturated fats (animal fats), and cholesterol.  There's a lot of eggs<BR>
&gt;and cheese involved, not to mention meats.  This makes it pretty hard to<BR>
&gt;regulate your cholesterol.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you've been following the Paleodiet list-group, as well as read the Lutz<BR>
book excerpt, you will find that (like virtually all of western people)<BR>
you've been fully indoctrinated with the &quot;party line&quot; about fats.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's now becoming clearer &amp; clearer (read Barry Sears' book &quot;The Zone&quot; for<BR>
a starter, or Lutz's excerpt, escpecially his section &quot;Fat is Not The<BR>
Culprit&quot;) that this fear of fat and supposed health benefits by its<BR>
avoidance is total bullshit, let me repeat, bullshit, foisted on us on the<BR>
industrial food-processing industries starting in the 50's.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Do some reading, convince yourself, then don't worry about it &amp; just eat<BR>
more &quot;good&quot; fats (i.e. lard or rancid beef fat are NOT a good fat, but I'd<BR>
say olive oil, chicken / duck fat, butter, full-fat yoghurt, fish oils,<BR>
,avocado probably are).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;She says it's possible to be a vegetarian on her<BR>
&gt;diet, but it would seem to be quite difficult, as complex carbohydrates are<BR>
&gt;basically prohibited, and these are important to complement the proteins in<BR>
&gt;legumes (the only vegetable proteins that seem to be allowed).  I'm not a<BR>
&gt;vegetarian, particularly, but I've found eating a near-vegetarian diet to<BR>
be an<BR>
&gt;excellent means of keeping my saturated fats low while getting enough<BR>
protein.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Any thoughts on this problem?  I'm 54 years old, and while IBD (they're<BR>
not sure<BR>
&gt;if it's UC or Crohn's colitis) is certainly a major health issue, it probably<BR>
&gt;won't kill me -- and a heart attack very well might.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Then there's the colon cancer problem, important generally but especially<BR>
so for<BR>
&gt;those of us with colitis.  It's known that a low-fat high-fiber (whole grains<BR>
&gt;again) diet lowers the risk factors for colon cancer.  It would seem that<BR>
&gt;Elaine's diet would be higher risk in this regard.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On Elaine's diet you'll be eating lots of veggies and some fruits, plus<BR>
normal amounts of fat.  Read the Sears book, and stop worrying about the<BR>
Fat Police ... I now believe that theory will soon be publically propounded<BR>
as &quot;Oops, screwed your head around once more, sorry, let's go on to the<BR>

Have you tried crunchy cheese chips?  They crunch like potatoe chips and are<BR>
delicious.  We use shredded cheddar cheese.  Put a thin layer of cheese on a<BR>
hot griddle and keep it over low heat.  When one side is a little brown you<BR>
can flip it over and brown the other side lightly.  I like to cool it on a<BR>
paper towel. When it's not to hot to touch break it up and enjoy.<BR>

&gt; One more point in buying milk is the<BR>
&gt;container. I choose to buy only the waxed carton. The reason being the<BR>
&gt;clear plastic bottle allows the rays from the neon lighting in the display<BR>
&gt;case to destroy some of the vit. D that has been add to the milk.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I never thought of that, but a better reason for not buying anything in plastic<BR>
(if you can help it) is the fact that plastic has been scientifically proven to<BR>
leach chemicals into the food that is stored in it.  Some plastics ARE safer<BR>
than others, but no-one knows which are which, and I wouldn't count on the<BR>
government regulatory bodies to ensure our safety with something like this.<BR>
You are better off to buy everything in glass or paper containers whenever<BR>
possible.  At least this practice reduces your risks.  There are tons of<BR>
potentially harmful environmental materials and things around us, but we do<BR>
take some precautions, like anti-radiation screens on our computers, not<BR>
sitting too close to the t.v., trying (in vain) to wash off the chemicals used<BR>
in fruits and vegetables, recycling wherever possible, etc.  That's why I try<BR>
to do one more thing, and that's not buying plastic unless I have to.  You'll<BR>
still catch me with it sometimes, because it's not easy to avoid.  Plastic is<BR>
everywhere when you start to think about it.  And even when it comes to those<BR>
cartons of milk, they are still lined with paraffin wax (or whatever kind of<BR>
wax), which is a petroleum product, which is in effect the same as a plastic,<BR>
so who knows if that is just as harmful.  Somehow it seems better to me than<BR>
the plastic jugs.  One thing I never do is buy OIL in a plastic bottle because<BR>
oils and fats will LEACH the harmful chemicals from the plastic very readily.<BR>
They say oil is the worst thing to put in plastic.  Any liquids have a chance<BR>
of leaching, and dry foods are the least likely to leach the chemicals.<BR>
Cooking or heating anything in plastic is also the worst, especially in the<BR>
microwave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most people think this plastic stuff that I'm saying here is far fetched or a<BR>
bit irrational, but if you saw the program I did on tv about it, you would be<BR>
convinced too.  These scientists were doing some lab experiments, and<BR>
accidentaly discovered that the plastic beaker they were using caused cellular<BR>
changes in whatever it was they were storing in it.  I can't recall all the<BR>
details of it but they mentioned that the beaker plastic was found to cause<BR>
cancer, and that further investigation revealed that some plastics leached<BR>
molecules into food that acted as &quot;fake estrogen&quot; when ingested, binding onto<BR>
our natural estrogen receptors, taking up the room for the real estrogen.  This<BR>
caused males to have low sperm counts, shrinkage of the sex organs, etc.  The<BR>
story went on to show how these baby alligators that live in an area polluted<BR>
by pulp and paper mill effluents (which they say are similar chemicals to those<BR>
coming from the plastics), were being born nearly a-sexual, with less and less<BR>
of a differentiation between the males and females.  You're probably thinking<BR>
by this point, that I'm nuts, or this program I'm telling about was done by<BR>
people who were all nuts, but I swear, it all sounded quite proffessional and<BR>
authoritative, complete with world renowned scientists, and doctors being<BR>
interviewed, and even they said they went home and threw out all their<BR>
tupperware and started only using ceramic and glass once they found out about<BR>
it.  One day I might write a book called &quot;The Plastic Conspiracy&quot;.  If I had<BR>
time, I would research it and find out the truth about these evil plastics, but<BR>
until then, I just try to avoid it if I can.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw in my two cents on the plastic comment.  Hope<BR>
you don't all think I'm nuts.  I didn't make this all up, I just believed it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Certainly pleased to see the list up and running agn. with so many<BR>
&gt;contributing to it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Same here.  Just like the old days with this list.  Lots of messages back and<BR>
forth.  I like it.<BR>

I agree about not getting your hopes up about allergy testing.  I've been<BR>
there, done that, as they say.  I had a Vega test done by a Naturopath, which<BR>
uses a special machine, electric current and samples of about 25 different<BR>
allergens in little vials. And also an extensive blood allergy test called IgG<BR>
IgE or something to that effect at another Naturopath. This one tested me for<BR>
about 200 different foods, spices, etc.  Both of these tests are supposed to<BR>
find allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities.  I've been to several NDs.<BR>
All the results of these allergy tests came out ambiguous and did not hold<BR>
true, which was really disappointing to me.  At the time, I thought that this<BR>
allergy thing WAS the answer.  The things I absolutely KNEW I was allergic to<BR>
because I get the early stages of anaphalaxis when I eat them, did not even<BR>
show up on these tests, so now I don't trust them.  When I questioned the<BR>
doctor about this, they said that these tests only test for so called &quot;hidden<BR>
allergies&quot; not the obvious ones.  I didn't buy that.   I don't know about the<BR>
skin scratch allergy tests that the MDs do.  I hear they are mainly good to<BR>
test for airborne things, or contact dermatitis type reaction allergens, and<BR>
not so good for foods, because foods are not introduced through the skin, but<BR>
rather, through the mucosa of the digestive tract.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
I totally agree with Dietmar's excellent post in response to John's valid<BR>
concern.  We have been brainwashed in this society.  The industries do it quite<BR>
easily, and the mainstream medical industries fall for it too.  Especially the<BR>
Dieticians, whose schooling in my opinion is major brainwashing (sorry to<BR>
offend anyone out there who is one).  The things most MDs and Dieticians<BR>
believe in are pounded it into their heads for years during the training.  Then<BR>
they become so closed minded, it's almost impossible to convince them of<BR>
anything else.  Tell any Dietician about our SCD and they'll tell you it's just<BR>
plain wrong.  They don't want to hear an explanation or believe in anyone's<BR>
testimonial experience, because that is the extent of their brainwashing, so to<BR>
speak.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I just saw another exposee that told how they actually have no scientific<BR>
evidence that salt is bad for high blood pressure and heart disease.  Ask<BR>
anyone you know and they'll tell you that too much salt is bad for you.<BR>
Apparently there is no real proof of this.  They actually have studies proving<BR>
the opposite, that there's nothing really wrong with salt, and this idea of the<BR>
badness of salt started in the 50's with a theory, a rumor and it stuck.  The<BR>
media is to blame for all this misinformation as well.  Think about how many<BR>
things in the past have been so publicized and thought to be true by the mass<BR>
population, and then later on were disproved and are now regarded as total<BR>
bunk.  An old saying goes that many of these ideas we think are &quot;the way it<BR>
is&quot;, will one day be accepted to be &quot;as old as sealing wax&quot;. (I think that<BR>
refers to the wax people used to use to seal letters, correct me if I'm wrong)<BR>
meaning that at one time in history, everyone did it and thought it was normal,<BR>
but now nobody does it anymore and wouldn't even consider it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, the point is, I think Dietmar was on the ball with his bit of advice.<BR>
If I were concerned about cholesterol (rightfully so, with all the media about<BR>
it), I would take a cholesterol test now, before starting the diet, get a<BR>
baseline reading, and then go on the diet for a month.  Eat more fish and<BR>
poultry, less red meat; more egg whites, less yolks; more olive oil, less<BR>
butter, and more nuts, fruits, and vegies.  Notice I said &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot;,<BR>
not &quot;all&quot; or &quot;none&quot;.  There's nothing wrong with a little butter, but that<BR>
doesn't mean you can slather it on like there's no tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another thing I remembered is the butter/margerine thing.  Remember how it was<BR>
thought that margerine was healthier than butter.  Everyone was convinced.<BR>
Nobody would dare say they thought butter was ok.  But NOW, it has been proven<BR>
that margerine is actually WAY WORSE for everyone than even butter!  Ever hear<BR>
about Trans-fatty acids, hydrogenation, etc? Did you know that there are<BR>
actually regulations or laws now that prevent margerine advertisments from<BR>
claiming margerine is good for your health?  It's all because they proved that<BR>
margerine is horrible for you!  Thank God margerine is not allowed on this<BR>
diet.  Although, I stopped eating margerine way before I found this diet.<BR>
Margerine was only invented during the war because there wasn't enough butter<BR>
to go around.  I'm too young to remember, but remember when you had to squeeze<BR>
the food coloring in and mix it up yourself?  Gross!  When the war ended there<BR>
was no reason to keep eating margerine, but the companies needed to keep making<BR>
money so it became the &quot;healthier&quot; counterpart to butter.  Now we all know<BR>
different, don't we.  Not to mention that margerine is an oil usually stored in<BR>
plastic (for those of you who read my plastic ramblings earlier).  Margerine is<BR>
probably worse than eating plastic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ok, you're starting to think I'm nuts again, so I better go.  That'll be all<BR>
for now.  Sorry to be so long.<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Are the following forbidden on the diet?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Elaine has said kidney beans are allowed.<BR>
The rest of things you listed, I'm not positive about.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Why are garbanzos (chick peas) forbidden, but not white beans or lentils or<BR>
&gt;split peas?  What's the principle here?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We don't really know why in a lot of cases.  One reason I have heard is that<BR>
Elaine didn't have a chance to &quot;test out&quot; every single food known to man and<BR>
she mainly went by what the Drs. Haas told her. After all, they apparently<BR>
invented it, not her.  She is no food scientist, and she didn't even have IBD<BR>
herself.  The amount of research and work done by her just to figure out those<BR>
foods listed as allowable so far, was very extensive and labour intensive.  I<BR>
am greatful just for that alone.  I think that basically, that is the reason.<BR>
Maybe with more research, we could find out more foods we could possibly eat<BR>
and more answers as to why.  But who has time or resources for that kind of<BR>
project?  It seems the medical establishment couldn't care less about the<BR>
purported anecdotal evidence that this diet helps us.  I haven't seen anyone<BR>
rushing to do any studies, controlled trials, etc.  It seems all anyone wants<BR>
to do is dis-prove it, rather than prove it unfortunately.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Why almond milk only after 6 months?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I found myself asking WHY to a LOT of things in this book.  Finally I gave up<BR>
and just accepted it, because usually, nobody knows why.  We can theorize, but<BR>
then again, that's what this diet is all about.  A theory.  I think almond milk<BR>
probably contains concentrated forms of carbohydrates and therefore maybe<BR>
harder to digest.  Just like you're not supposed to eat nuts at all until the<BR>
diarreah is gone.  Not everyone realizes the fact that this diet is a gradual<BR>
process of introducing things.  It's not an all or nothing type of thing.  We<BR>
are supposed to start out with limited foods that are easier to digest, and as<BR>
we get better, add a few more things, like the nuts, beans, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's remember the name of this diet is &quot;Specific&quot; Carbohydrate Diet.  It seems<BR>
that it's not necessarily a carbo free diet or even merely a low carbo diet.<BR>
For some reasons, mostly unknown at this time, certain carbohydrates are easier<BR>
to digest for us than others.  That's probably why some beans are yes and some<BR>
are no.  God only knows, as the saying goes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Is there any way to communicate with Elaine directly to get authoritative<BR>
&gt;information about these kinds of details?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have heard that Elaine is actually very open to getting phone calls.  From<BR>
personal experience, I know she doesn't really like answering questions by fax<BR>
because it takes too long to write it all out.  She is happy to answer all your<BR>
questions on the phone.  I think her new number is 905-349-3443.  After talking<BR>
to some people, I've heard that she sometimes even phones to check on how they<BR>
are doing later on.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,<BR>

John,<BR>
I agree about the fact that we don't know the whole story on fat and<BR>
cholesterol.  I also heard on the news the other day that aside from<BR>
advoiding animal fats, people who want to keep their cholesterol levels<BR>
under control should avoid sugar as well.<BR>
I think the key is that it's really only animal fats that have been<BR>
linked to higher cholesterol levels.  So you should not be worried about<BR>
eating the other fats, like olive oil and the fats in nuts and fish.<BR>
And depending on your diet before, you may actually end up eating lower<BR>
fat content overall.  A lot of the foods that we have to avoid because<BR>
of their sugar or starch content, also have a lot of fat in them, like<BR>
donuts, cakes and chocolate bars.<BR>
As far as fiber goes, the diet is high in fiber once diarrhea is no<BR>
longer a problem and you can start introducing raw fruits and<BR>
vegetables, nuts and beans.  And I'm pretty sure that oat bran is not<BR>
the only soluble fiber that has been linked to lowering cholesterol.<BR>
Another source of soluble fiber is the part of a fruit other than it's<BR>
skin.<BR>
Also, exercise is a very successful way of controlling your cholesterol<BR>
level, as well as many other health benefits.<BR>
By the way, there were a few people on the diet who posted their pre and<BR>
post diet cholesterol levels and they had actually dropped.<BR>

Take care,<BR>
