<B>Vacations</B><BR>

<BR>
Hi Everybody,<BR>
My husband has been on the diet for about seven weeks. He feels better than<BR>
he has felt in years. The diet has been a miracle for us! We are thinking<BR>
about going on vacation this summer but we are unsure about what to do<BR>
about the diet. We have not been out to eat since starting the diet. We<BR>
don't want to chance eating something that will cause problems. I would<BR>
appreciate suggestions from anyone who has vacationed while on the diet
and<BR>
how they handled it. Is it possible to stay on the diet while on vacation<BR>
or should he not follow the diet while on vacation. We are thinking about<BR>
not taking a vacation because of the diet which seems kind of silly. I<BR>
would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!<BR>
<BR>

Hi Becky,<BR>
<BR>
It is tough to go on vacation while on the diet, but it can be done.  I<BR>
did a month ago.  Had a few reactions do to probably mystery ingredients<BR>
in foods, but all in all, it was fine.  If you can really be assertive<BR>
and talk to the waiters and waitresses, it really helps.  Explain your<BR>
situation.  In restaurants, I tend to eat eggs, leave the toast and<BR>
potatoes on the plate, ask for a side of fruit.  Also, green salads (if<BR>
they are tolerated, of course) with plain oil and vinegar on the side. <BR>
Dinners I get broiled or grilled chicken or fish with no additives<BR>
except butter and salt and pepper.  Skip the starchy side dish and ask<BR>
for an extra side of vegetables with no potatoes, or salad.  I have<BR>
found that I can eat most caesar salads, which can be pretty filling as<BR>
well. Sometimes I've ordered two.  Drink only water, week coffee and tea<BR>
(i.e,, don't trust the juices).  Buy extra stuff that your husband can<BR>
eat at the grocery store and keep in on hand or in your hotel room for<BR>
snacks.<BR>
<BR>
I found that I was hungry all the time while on vacation, but it can be<BR>
done.  It also can get expensive ordering all those side dishes!   :) <BR>
But I was only on the diet for about a month when I went on vacation,<BR>
and I did fine.  Hope you have a great trip!<BR>

When I went on vacation last year I took some food with me to keep me from
<BR>
getting too hungry and cheating on my diet.  I brought unsweetened banana
chips, <BR>
peanuts and some fruit.  I also brought some nut bread, but unfortunately
it <BR>
didn't keep much longer than a few days.<BR>
As for restaurants, I think that Anna's suggestions covered my own ideas
about <BR>
that.<BR>

One great way to take a vacation is to go somewhere and rent a house, <BR>
like a beach or mountain house, where you can still shop and do your own
<BR>
cooking.  Some B&amp;B's will accomodate you if you call and clear it in
<BR>
advance. Fish and steak houses are your best bet for restaurants, as you
<BR>
can usually get fish/steak, along with steamed veggies and salad with <BR>
legal dressings (vinegarette,etc..)  Go for it!<BR>

<B>Camping</B><BR>

<BR>
Has anyone out there gone camping with this disease. I'm not worried about
the<BR>
diet aspect, as I can bring my own foods. What I'm wondering about is the<BR>
bathroom aspect. If we go to the woods where there are no facilities, what<BR>
will it be like if I get diarreah? Do you bring a shovel and dig a hole
to go<BR>
in, or what? I know this sounds like a weird question, but who else can
I<BR>
ask!? Should I take something to prevent the possibility, like Immodium?
I've<BR>
never taken it before and wonder if it causes constipation also.<BR>

Hi Anna,<BR>
<BR>
Regarding camping, I think digging a hole in the woods be an excellent<BR>
solution if there are no facilities. I mean, when you gotta go, you<BR>
gotta go. A tips: go facing down hill or you may discover that even the<BR>
slightest incline will work against you! Also, camping in a nice<BR>
campground with good toilet availability, and then sticking close to<BR>
camp can still provide an enjoyable camping experience.<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes,<BR>

I've been camping, both in places that had bathrooms, and also in the<BR>
wilderness. If you go the route of an established campground, try to<BR>
arrange for a site close to the restrooms. This is generally easy, given<BR>
that there's more activity there than around the more remote sites (and<BR>
often lights that stay on all night). If you are going the wilderness<BR>
route, then you needn't worry, and you probably should bring a shovel to<BR>
dig a latrine, or you can &quot;bury it&quot; with some dirt and leaves,
a good<BR>
distance from your tent! I found that camping whilst symptomatic wasn't<BR>
too comfortable, as I tend to be overly sensitized to temperature and the<BR>
hard, cold ground. Look for a nice pine grove where there will be lots of<BR>
cushy pine needles that you can use as cushioning under your tent. Stay<BR>
away from hot dogs and marshmallows!<BR>

Anna asks about camping. We have half ownership with another family <BR>
of a remote cabin in PA. Throughout my worst times I tried not to <BR>
let UC get the better of me. I always kept a few sheets of paper <BR>
toweling in my pocket and took a couple of Immodium a few hours before <BR>
going walking. I always get good results from Immodium, taken as per <BR>
the box - two to start and one later as needed. This also works for <BR>
going to say, a movie or a picnic. Just take two about 2-4 hours <BR>
before leaving. Concerning the need for a shovel, I don't think most <BR>
soils are hard enough to require one. Just kick a small hole with <BR>
your boot heel!<BR>

Well, I think I can take this one... D on the trail is inconvenient, but<BR>
not really more inconvenient than the problems everyone has on the trail.<BR>
You just have to do like you do in the other forums of your life and keep<BR>
an eye open for bathroom opportunities. I recommend getting yourself a<BR>
book about low-impact camping from your library, which will include rules<BR>
about latrines. Now, you can just bring a trowel and some TP and keep 'em<BR>
someplace where you can get at them easily, but in some parks/trails, you<BR>
have to pack out what you bring in. EVERYTHING you bring in. In that<BR>
case, may I recommend putting those ziplock bags that you bring your food<BR>
in to good use by &quot;recycling them&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
As far as digging latrines, you want to stay far away from potable water,<BR>
and the trail, and from places where people can see you, obviously. just<BR>
dig a small hole, do your duty, then fill the hole back in carefully.<BR>
Make sure your TP is fully degradable (get it at a camping supply place!)<BR>
or be prepared to pack out wads of TP, cause you can't leave it. Quick<BR>
release clips on your pack are of tremendous help here, for obvious<BR>
reasons.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, and enjoy yourself!<BR>

I haven't braved overnight camping yet (but I miss it and<BR>
hope to try soon), but I have gone on day hikes where<BR>
bathrooms were not available. I would suggest making up a<BR>
fanny pack (a portable bathroom of sorts) with paper,<BR>
plastic baggies (in case you have to pack anything out) and<BR>
maybe even some baby towelettes; this makes things handy in<BR>
case you have to dash. Sometimes it's wise to wear elastic<BR>
waist pants rather than ones that zip. I would also suggest<BR>
you make every effort to dig a hole so you can bury<BR>
whatever, just as a courtesy to other campers who may come<BR>
through later. This can be done ahead of time in a site<BR>
agreed upon by all the other campers. Also try to make your<BR>
&quot;bathroom&quot; as far away as possible from any bodies of water.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps!<BR>

Subject: <B>Travel Tips for Yogurt</B><BR><BR>

Hey fellow SCDers,<BR><BR>

Worried about a vacation weekend away from the comforts of your
refrigerator and yogurt maker? I know I was. I just got back from a
travel weekend and here is how I found success in traveling with homemade
yogurt and other SCD items:<BR><BR>

- I used a small plastic cooler (a bit larger than the size of a six-pack
of sodas, and a bit taller.)<BR>
- I put homemade yogurt into small yogurt containers (which I kept from
store-bought commercial yogurt.)<BR>
- I filled a large zip-lock bag with ice cubes and placed it in the
bottom of the cooler.<BR>
- I stacked the yogurt containers on top of the ice.<BR>
- I placed a zip-lock bag containing SCD muffins on top of the yogurt
containers, then closed the cooler.<BR><BR>

I traveled ten hours (by car), and the yogurt stayed nice and cold! I
imagine you could also take a small cooler like this on most airlines.<BR><BR>

Hope this helps someone. Any other travel tips out there? If so, please
share them.
<BR><BR>
Sincerely,<BR><BR>

<BR>
To all,<BR>
<BR>
Just a quick note about SCD &amp; being able to continue life. We just came<BR>
back from a camping vacation with our 8 year old daughter who has been on<BR>
the SCD for 4 months or so. It can be done! The greatest problem seemed to<BR>
be 'lumpies' (ie smoothies without a blender - not quite as palatable). We<BR>
had to do a few restaurant meals &amp; the minute people are told it is a<BR>
matter of 'allergies' they are extremely co-operative - more than willing<BR>
to look at ingredients &amp; bend the menu to accomodate the diet. <BR>
<BR>
Although there had been a discussion on travel &amp; eating out in this list a<BR>
few months ago, I was still a bit worried about the reality of eating out.<BR>
It worked out fine. (I have to say that we kept away from the ubiquitous<BR>
fast food/multinational food corporations,  assuming that the smaller,<BR>
local restaurants would be more accomodating, (I won't get into the<BR>
politics of the other places) &amp; I think we were right to go that route).<BR>
<BR>
So I guess the message for all new persons who are worried about life &amp;<BR>
'the diet'  - they do go together. <BR>
<BR>
LS<BR>
<BR>
PS I have been more than interested in the discussion on AS - can it happen<BR>
in children? We cut our vacation early because she was having pain in her<BR>
hips. Currently going through a multitude of tests. (Oh bless Canadian<BR>
medicare!)<BR>

I travelled this summer by car for a week.  I made a large batch of <BR>

DCCC to take along in case I couldn't find any on the way.  When I <BR>
travel by plane I pack my yogurt in an insulated carry on bag.  When I <BR>
arrive at the destination,  I put it in the fridge, most hotel rooms <BR>
have bar fridges.  I had no problem with spoilage.  Hope this helps.<BR>

I'm dreaming of going this Spring on a cross-country horseback riding<BR>
vacation to Ireland.<BR>
We would horseback ride daily through the country side from Inn to Inn<BR>
where we would be sleeping.  Lunch will be provided for us on the trail<BR>
by the tour leader. I would be going with my daughter and a group of 20<BR>
friends, kids and adults that all know each other (most know about my<BR>
colitis and how i eat SCD).  Am I crazy to think I can do such a trip<BR>
in  a remote part of the countryside ?<BR>
<BR>
Has anyone traveled internationally with prepared food?  Can you bring<BR>
cooked muffins, yogurt and nuts through customs ??<BR>
<BR>
Am I crazy to think I could manage the meals at the Bed and breakfast<BR>
Inns? Does anyone know if they cook everything stewed with potatoes in<BR>
Ireland. Is plain roast meats readily available at Inns? How could I<BR>
manage the picnic lunches on the trail if I couldn't bring my own food?<BR>
<BR>
I realize i have to get some answers directly from the tour person, what<BR>
<BR>
other things should I think of to ask? Any suggestions would be very<BR>
helpful.  Just thinking about going is churning my stomach with<BR>
excitement. I hope i don't get D from this excitement :o<BR>

I travel regualrly around Europe on work and there is no problem <BR>
bringing made up cookies, nuts and cakes into countries like Ireland.  <BR>
About your only restriction is plant seeds - so unless you've developed <BR>
a sudden craving for chewing on maple tree seeds, then you're OK!<BR>
<BR>
Most Inns in the UK and Ireland have simple fare - meat, veg and <BR>
potatoes.  Many will now also do salads.  Most meat is plain (roasted or <BR>
grilled) but you need to watch out for the sausages as most will have <BR>
rusk or modified starch as a constiuent. If you take enough cookies and <BR>
cakes for snakcs then I think you'll find it fine.<BR>

That sounds like a wonderful vacation! I love horse back riding but haven't<BR>
been in years. I used to own an Arab.<BR>
(3/4 Arabian, 1/4 Saddlebred).  The woman I bought her from owned several<BR>
Arabs and bred them. I used to help her show them.  I live in an equestrian<BR>
neighborhood of Southern California and have been toying with the idea of<BR>
taking some riding lessons to get 'back in the saddle'. I prefer English to<BR>
Western riding.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway on to your questions. I went to New Zealand in January and I baked a<BR>
batch of zucchini muffins and took them with me. I had absolutely no<BR>
problem with customs. In February I traveled to Scotland and the<BR>
Netherlands and again took my homemade muffins with no problems getting<BR>
through customs.  It seems that prepared foods are not nearly as controlled<BR>
as fresh foods, i.e. fruit and meats.<BR>
<BR>
I also had to eat out a lot while traveling and sometimes it was difficult,<BR>
but most times I was able to either find something on the menu or make a<BR>
special request on a menu item, such as no seasoning (in case they use<BR>
season salt), no sauces, etc. Fish was usually a safe choice.<BR>
<BR>
My husband and I stayed at a bed and breakfast in Santa Barbara over our<BR>
anniversary weekend. I didn't say anything about my diet to the owner of<BR>
the B&amp;B so at breakfast I was disappointed when all they were serving was<BR>
carbs, pancakes, cereal, etc.  They served a bowl of strawberries, but that<BR>
would not give me any protein to burn, so they hard boiled a couple of eggs<BR>
for me. How can people survive on total carbohydrates for breakfast??? The<BR>
proprietor told me that she would have made me a special breakfast had I<BR>
told her the evening before.  I learned my lesson.<BR>
<BR>
I might suggest, since you have several months before the trip find out<BR>
exactly which Inns you will stay at and call them to inquire about their<BR>
menus.  I find that most places are willing to make something special if<BR>
they know in advance.<BR>
<BR>
It does sound like and exciting trip. I hope you get to go. Maybe you could<BR>
post some pictures of the trip when you return.<BR>

I've been to Ireland and though it's there in myth, I don't remember<BR>
eating a lot of potatoes. :)  Breakfast is oatmeal, Irish soda bread,<BR>
bacon (I don't know if it has sugar or starch in it but it's the best<BR>
bacon in the world), eggs and at least one time, we had grapefruit. <BR>
This is a typical breakfast so at least eggs, probably bacon and<BR>
grapefruit are safe.  Dinner was terribly boring with food that needed<BR>
seasoning.  I don't think it would be difficult to find roast beef, etc.<BR>
 Irish food is supposed to be undergoing great change, like in America<BR>
where people are interested in new foods.  I believe they are supposed<BR>
to have great cheese and fresh produce and those should be good in the<BR>
Spring.  If you know the names of the inns before you go, and it sounds<BR>
like you will, I'd simply write them and tell them about your special<BR>
diet.  If they're simple mom and pop places, tell them you don't want<BR>
special treatment, just simple meat and vegetables.  Might be bland but<BR>
safe. :)  If they are the fancier inns, there shouldn't be any problems<BR>
with the chef providing you with what you need.<BR>

P.S.  It's going to rain and rain and rain in the Spring.  It isn't 40<BR>

on and on.  Can you tell I've kissed the Blarney Stone? - for non-Irish,<BR>
it's supposed to &quot;give the gift of gab.&quot;<BR>
