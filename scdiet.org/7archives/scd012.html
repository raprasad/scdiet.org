<P>In my experience my doctor's recommendations regarding diet were useless. 
They never helped.  Not in any significant way.
<BR>The SCD has not only helped, it has put my life back into my control.

The Specific Carbohydrate Diet is developed by the Canadian biochemist Elaine Gottschall 
who has published the book &quot;<B><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0969276818/goodbooksA/">Breaking
      the Vicious Cycle</A></B>&quot; - which is <I>the</I> book about the 
Specific Carbohydrate Diet. 
        <P> Elaine Gottschall has spent four years at the University of Western Ontario 
          researching the effects of various sugars on the digestive tract at 
          cellular level, and one year researching the changes that occur in the 
          bowel wall in inflammatory disease. The results of her work are published 
          in the journal Acta Anatomica 123:178(1985). And the details of the 
          Specific Carbohydrate Diet can be found in her book.

          <BR>
          The basic principle of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet is: never eat 
          something that your intestines cannot digest. There are specific carbohydrates 
          which are trouble makers in the digestive system... <BR>
          <BR>
          It has done wonders for thousands of people, all around the globe. However, 
          it is a tough diet to get a handle on, and many people do not or cannot 
          stick with it long enough to find some benefits in it. It is after all 
          a fairly simple diet, that is in so much as you ingest no starch or 
          refined sugars. But that simple statement requires a complete change 
          of life style. That requires a great deal of determination. <BR>
          <BR>
          But, it is a loooong story - so, first of all, get hold of the book!

Subject: <B>Give it a try newcomers</B><BR><BR>
I have some personal advice to any newcomers to the diet, especially those who
are quite sick at the time they are starting the diet.  
<BR>Start slowly,
gradually, and carefully.  You can't just jump into it, eating all the
allowables in the beginning.  You should start out with foods that are easier
to digest and when the diarreah goes away you can introduce more foods
gradually like raw fruits and vegies and nut breads.  But in the beginning, be
sure to peel, remove seeds, and cook all fruits and vegies well, and hold off
on the nut related recipes.  If you have any questions, ask us on the list and
we can walk you through it.  
<BR>
The book does explain this, but sort of in a round
about way, and some people who just skim through the book and then start the
diet tend to miss this crucial introductory phase.  It upsets me because then
they tend to get worse and blame the diet, when in reality, if they had
followed it more carefully it may have worked.  It's not complicated, really.<BR>
Give it a try.<BR>

Subject: <B>we've all been there</B><BR><BR>
Dear Very Worried Mother,<BR>
I remember when I was first diagnosed, thinking &quot;what the hell is UC?&quot;
Never heard of it, didn't know anyone who had it and was sure I'd been
struck by some rare, unheard of deadly disease. The most amazing thing
about your letter and those you'll see on this site, is that it seems that
at one stage or another, we've all been there. Same road, same shock, same
feelings of helplessness and isolation. We've all had variations of the
same doctors, some well-meaning and ignorant of this disease, others
arogant and ignorant (worst combo) of this disease.
As far as I know, nothing (with the exception of removal of the colon) has
had the same success rate as this diet. It works to varying degrees in
different people and for an unfortunate few doesn't seem to work, but
there's tons of testimony (see <A HREF="http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/">
www.inform.dk/djembe/scd</A> ) that
proves that there are scores of people like myself (4 years of remission on
4/1/99) who've had their lives turned around by the diet. Good luck and
hang in there.<BR>

&lt;&lt; Is the book available in Australia, or only North America and Europe?<BR>
&lt;&lt; Getting books from one hemisphere to another is a long and slow journey at<BR>

The book is available from Barnes &amp; Noble on their web site:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.barnesandnoble.com">www.barnesandnoble.com</A><BR>
<BR>
They can ship anywhere in the world.   I have no idea what the shipping 
charges are to Australia, but I'm sure you can find out at the website before<BR>
ordering.<BR>

I purchased the book from <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0969276818/goodbooksA/">Amazon.com</A> 
and it took about a month to arrive in 
Darwin. The cost of the book with postage and handling was $29.00 American 
working out to $50.00 Australian. Yes its a bit pricey but its worth every 
cent.<BR>
