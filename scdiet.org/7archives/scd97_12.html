<P><B>Re: Ambrotose</B><BR>
Thu, 6 Feb 1997 2:20:19 GMT<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&gt;Hello All<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am a new subscriber to the scd list. My husband has UC and we are<BR>
&gt;two weeks in to the scd diet. Having trouble locating all the food<BR>
&gt;stores needed, but managing to get along.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;For the lasst week or so I've been learning as much as possible about<BR>
&gt;all the related topics. SO MUCH TO LEARN. A man e-mailed me today<BR>
&gt;about something called Ambrotose, a dietary supplement of<BR>
&gt;glycoprotein technology, phytochemicals. Does anyone know if I<BR>
&gt;should take the time to investigate further? The mail looked more<BR>
&gt;like an inticing advertisement, although it said a lot about the<BR>
&gt;product. I confused enough about the drug my husband is on...does<BR>
&gt;this make sense, or is it too good to be true?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Hoping you can help. Cheryl</TT><BR>

<BR>
Hi Cheryl,<BR>
Welcome to our group. Hope you find some helpfull advise here to help your<BR>
husband get the most out of the SCD diet.<BR>
In my personel opinion, the diet, a multi vitamin, perhaps a calcium<BR>
suplement and whatever meds the doctor currently has him on are enough of
a<BR>
start. I know that some of us in the group believe in a couple of more<BR>
exotic suppliments, but in my own experience, the basics I mentioned and
a<BR>
positive outlook have my UC under total control. I've been on the diet for<BR>
almost 2 years (May 1st) with maximium success. Lots of luck to you.<BR>
Rachel<BR>

<BR>
As one who has tried all the latest and greatest remedies that come along
I<BR>
must agree with Rachel. Don't waste your money on Ambrotose. If it really<BR>
works it will catch on like wildfire and you will hear about it. The more<BR>
probable scenario is that it will gain a small following and then peter
out.<BR>
I could show you probably 5 websites promoting miracle cures that will<BR>
absolutely totally cure you with testimonials to match, only thing is they<BR>
don't work! Best of luck with the diet, its the closest I've come to a cure

<BR>
This Ambrotose product has rice bran in it, I believe, so it might<BR>
contradict the hard work of the ScD diet. Also, silica. I tried a<BR>
&quot;Phytobear&quot; one evening and woke up about 4 the next morning with
night<BR>
sweats and ran to the bathroom and vomited a lot. The person who'd been<BR>
recommending said she'd never heard of such a reaction and that it probably<BR>
indicated I really needed them because something was getting done. These<BR>
products are made from aloe vera, which can kill pinworms (which I'm<BR>
battling as y'all know by now), but it contraindicated for diarrhea. Anyway,<BR>
as others have said, &quot;I'm sticking to the diet&quot; and medicines
that have been<BR>
working, along with eating foods that go after worms (the last is Asian<BR>
bitter melon, available at E. Asian markets, one a day for ten days!).<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps, Ann in Maryland<BR>

<B>Hi Rachel,</B><BR>
<BR>
I am writing to ask you a question: When you first started the diet, how<BR>
long had you been experiencing symptoms for and what was the longest time<BR>
they went on unabated. I am interested in the diets effectiveness against<BR>
Candida. I undoubtedly believe that the diet will help those who have an<BR>
imbalance of vegetarian bacteria in the lower digestive tract, but I<BR>
believe that Candida is too tricky for this diet. For instance Candidas<BR>
favourite foods are fructose, honey and the sugars in milk (and yoghurt).<BR>
Well that's the mainstay of the scd for you. Since I don't seem to making<BR>
good progress, I am thinking of quiting the diet. Cooking is such a hassle<BR>
for me, I am not eating, missing many meals each week. I am concerned that<BR>
leaving out these foods:honey, milk and fruit as well as the cereals, is<BR>
too many of the groups of foods that we need. So I am going to have to<BR>
regress to an anti-candida diet (which includes gluten free cereals) for
90<BR>
days and hope that I won't get worse in my UC. or maybe I should stay on<BR>
the diet and eliminate these foods from the diet I've already eliminated<BR>
dairy (feel better for it) as a concession the Candida diet allows fruit<BR>
(except for bananas, melons and grapes, and all dried fruit) if you stay
on<BR>
the program longer. but I am finding it hard without the honey.) And my<BR>
Chinese doctor says I should not be eating nuts. So that doesn't leave very<BR>
much left. So my question to you rachel is, did you eat much of these<BR>
mentioned foods when you were on the early part of the diet. I would be<BR>
interested to hear or did you stick mainly to the veges and meat.<BR>
<BR>
thanks<BR>
<BR>

<P>Dear Michael, I'm so sorry for the quandry you seem to in. My brother
has<BR>
a related desease. He has severe scoriatic arthritis. I mention this<BR>
because candidiasis is an issue for him too. I don't think however, that
it<BR>
is for me.<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&gt;Hi Rachel,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am writing to ask you a question: When you first started the diet,
how<BR>
&gt;long had you been experiencing symptoms for and what was the longest
time<BR>
&gt;they went on unabated.</TT><BR>
<BR>
To my best recollection, I began experiencing severe symptoms approx 11-12<BR>
years ago. For 2 years I had pain, diahrea, bleeding (severe at times) and<BR>
unrelenting urgency. I had to be 2 feet from the nearest bathroom at all<BR>
times and in retrospect have no idea how I managed to work, raise 2 kids<BR>
and hold a good marriage together. I was then diagnosed &amp; put on steroids
&amp;<BR>
Azulphdine. This kept things in relative control. Urgency all but<BR>
disappeared, and blood, pain &amp; diahrea on &amp; off but not constant.
This<BR>
continued for the next 8 years, when I discovered SCD (began 5/1/95). My<BR>
recovery from that point was almost constant and for the last year I've
had<BR>
almost no symptoms. I took myself off of Azulphadine about 6 months ago
and<BR>
if you've been following this mail, my colonoscopy last week was all but<BR>
miraculous.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<TT> So my question to you rachel is, did you eat much of these<BR>
&gt;mentioned foods when you were on the early part of the diet. I would
be<BR>
&gt;interested to hear or did you stick mainly to the veges and meat.</TT><BR>
<BR>
Yes, I've been eating almost everything on the diet. The only things I<BR>
haven't tried were some of the recipes and only because they either didn't<BR>
appeal to me or too complicated for me to attempt. I tend to stick with
the<BR>
simpler stuff and the only constant is that I eat yogurt every day. Hope<BR>
this helps. On a personal note, and based solely on my own experience, I<BR>
would recommend sticking with the diet. Elaine may be able to offer advise<BR>
to you with the candidiasis. She's recently moved and her new # is<BR>
905-349-3443. Good luck.<BR>
Sincerely, Rachel<BR>

<P><B>Hello Michael,</B><BR>
Tue, 11 Feb 1997 15:58:37 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I'm kind of new, and don't know the protocol yet, so forgive me if I'm<BR>
not supposed to respond.<BR>
I've been diagnosed with &quot;IBS&quot; whatever that is, and have been
on the<BR>
diet with great relief from hyperactivity in my intestines (alas, not the<BR>
D.) in the eight months I've been on the diet. We're talking about stomach<BR>
activity going from 24hours a day, down to a few flutters a day.<BR>
What caught my attention was your question about honey, fruit and milk<BR>
sugars. I've noticed, over time, that I had trouble with the honey, fruit<BR>
and recently couldn't tolerate milk or even my home-made yogurt. It was<BR>
making me feel really sick. So as recently as a couple of weeks ago I've<BR>
dropped them out of my diet completely, finding substitutes (which I can<BR>
share if you are interested), and which I thought would be nearly<BR>
impossible to live without. I even gave up eating the few spoonfuls of<BR>
jello made with grape juice that I allowed myself.<BR>
I am happy to report that my energy has gone up amazingly. I'm back to<BR>
myself, mentally, physically (except for D.) and feel, increasingly and<BR>
amazingly freer and free-er from the demands of attention from my stomach!<BR>
<BR>
Also, I think my weight has stabilized. It is possible this is some kind<BR>
of little reprieve, yet, I really think it has to do with my reactions to<BR>
these foods. Also, I've wondered if I have Candida.<BR>
I want to credit this approach to some, dear, one's who discussed testing<BR>
what works for us individually, recently on-line. Thanks, whoever you all<BR>
are.<BR>
Yes, Michael, there's life after honey, and it's getting sweeter.<BR>
<BR>
Best Wishes, Carolyn<BR>

<BR>
<B>Dear Michael,</B><BR>
I hope that you don't have to go back to grains to heal. I hope that SCD<BR>
can still be the base. I would like more input from Elaine on the candida.<BR>
I have dropped honey, I am a vegan and don't use dairy products. I use the<BR>
fruits and less of them now because of my teeth and the candida in my<BR>
mouth. Also veges and nuts. Why does the chinese doctor not want you to
use<BR>
them? I find your recipes for beans, peas, tahini, delicious however they<BR>
would be very difficult for me to handle in the am. And I would use just<BR>
one protein at a time. Tahini because it is from a seed is much easier for<BR>
my system to handle.<BR>
I think the world of you. You have been so helpful to others. I want to
see<BR>
you in the best of health and over this.<BR>
Also because of my mouth trip I have been making teas that have an<BR>
anti-bacterial in them, and clove buds are an easy and tasty one. Plus pau<BR>
d'arco, dandelion (for teeth). Keep your spirits up.<BR>
sincerely,<BR>
Sheila <BR>

<B>Carolyn,</B><BR>
<BR>
I must comment that I have taken the honey out of my diet as well and am<BR>
being rewarded for that. Fruit does not appear to bother me, but I have<BR>
taken out dairy, including yogurt, and now my bloating has cleared up. I<BR>
intend to try yogurt again soon but the honey is gone, I was suspicious
from<BR>
the beginning that it was a major factor for me. I am trying to incorporate<BR>
more bitter things in my diet and it seems to raise my energy level and
do<BR>
me good all round. For instance, I eat lettuce that is naturally bitter
and<BR>
I drink bitter dandelion tea from the health food store. <BR>

<P><B>On some recent remarks of Where the SCD list going</B><BR>
Fri, 14 Feb 1997 5:53:58 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I hold the SCD with a great deal of credence. I stay very close to the <BR>
book, but donot make any breads,or any form of baking. Pretty much all <BR>
fruit and veggies cooked or raw, as well cooked meats. I eat yoghurt on
<BR>
a regular basises and believe it to be one of the keys to good health on
<BR>
this diet. No medications, and few if any herbs. I try to keep my meals
<BR>
as simple as possiable, but healthy. <BR>
<BR>
I have been on the diet four years next month, with only one flair,and <BR>
that was very much my own doing. I am now very happy to live the rest of
<BR>
my life on this diet, I no longer miss the old foods, prior to the diet.<BR>
<BR>
The greatess hazard I still face is to find myself in a position <BR>
of being hungry. Of not eating often enough. This may sound silly to <BR>
some, but keep in mind all beings can become very aggresive <BR>
when hungry and inclined to throw caution to the wind. This can become a
<BR>
dangerous time.<BR>
<BR>
After four years on this scd, I am sure the newcomers must think I know
<BR>
all the ropes. I am to this very day still finding foods I thought were
<BR>
starch free. It is so easy to THINK you are on this diet, and all the <BR>
while getting starch from sources you never suspected. This list has <BR>
aided me immeasureably in the last year of eliminating suspect foods. At
<BR>
the time I found this list I had been on Elaine's diet almost three <BR>
years. It was with great enjoyment and comfort for me to find other <BR>
people in this world who suffered the same disease as I. A disease not <BR>
commonly spoke of out side of our own circle. But I came here and stayed
<BR>
here because this list was Elaine's diet. I feel I am very fortunate to
<BR>
be in some form of remission of Ulcerative Colitis. I dont believe the <BR>
disease is cured, but only under present control, as long as I stay with
<BR>
Elaine's diet. It worked for me, I am one of the lucky ones. Having said
<BR>
that I understand this diet may not work for everyone. However for <BR>
someone trying to get a start on Eleine's Specific Carbohydrate <BR>
Diet, as this list is purported to be, just for them to turn thier <BR>
eating habits around, and eliminate starch and refined sugar is a hugh <BR>
hugh undertaking for any newcomer. Let alone trying to understand the <BR>
medications we can live with. Now then throw in some Doctors who donot <BR>
believe diet plays a part in this disease.( sounds worse than having a <BR>
baby).Anything more to a newcomer is just confussion. I would ask that <BR>
our remarks regarding diet remain close to Elaine's book or similar <BR>
materials, if for no other reason than the benifit of the <BR>
newcomers. I do believe the disscussions on medications should continue,
<BR>
as long as we are accurate in our statements... finally I say this with
<BR>
no malice to anyone.<BR>
<BR>
best wishes and good health to all.<BR>
<BR>

<B>High fiber foods</B><BR>
Sun, 16 Feb 1997 16:46:32 GMT<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was taken from the CCFA homepage,  With the SCD diet, at least what
I<BR>
am eating is a huge increase in vegetable ingestion, specificaly salads,
2<BR>
large salads a day.  I am dressing these with olive oil and vinegar.  I<BR>
know of the testimonials and our feeling of &quot;if it works, don't change
it&quot;<BR>
but any ideas on all the fiber/cellulose/indigestible polysaccharides we/I<BR>
am eating.  I have been on the diet for 2 months and feel that the asacol<BR>
is really the thing that is maintaining my uc symptoms, unfortunately I
am<BR>
at a very high dosage of 4 pills/3x/day.  Whenever I try to sloooooooowly<BR>
decrease the asacol, blood, mucous and gassy cramping return.  Though I
am<BR>
drinking full strength de-cafe flavored coffee in the morning, and haven't<BR>
heard if this is forbidden or not.<BR>
<BR>
What follows is in regards to :<BR>
<BR>
High fiber foods.This category includes foods such as seeds, nuts, popcorn,<BR>
corn, and certain Chinese vegetables. These foods may produce cramping if<BR>
there is narrowing of the bowel. When this occurs early in the course of<BR>
the disease, it is often a temporary problem caused by edema or swelling
of<BR>
the bowel wall. Later in the course of the illness, these symptoms may<BR>
indicate scarring (stenosis) of the intestine. High fiber foods also<BR>
contribute to diarrhea (greater stool volume) because they are incompletely<BR>
digested by the small intestine. Once fiber enters the large intestine,
it<BR>
stimulates contractions, especially when the colon is inflamed with either<BR>
Crohn's colitis or ulcerative colitis. This is the reason for using &quot;low<BR>
residue&quot; foods such as broth, gelatin, poultry without skin, potatoes<BR>
without skin, rolls, noodles, rice, eggs and fish. High fiber foods may<BR>
also contribute to diarrhea by causing mechanical irritation if the colon<BR>
is severely inflamed.(CCFA Crohns, colitis foundation of america)<BR>

<BR>
FOS reference from an December 1995 article Scientific American --<BR>
<BR>
How Breast Milk Protects Newborns <BR>
by Jack Newman<BR>
<BR>
...<BR>
<BR>
&quot;An Abundance of Helpful Molecules<BR>
<BR>
Several molecules in human milk besides secretory IgA (antibodies or<BR>
immunoglobulins) prevent microbes from attaching to mucosal surfaces. <BR>
Oligiosaccharides, which are simple chains of sugars, often contain<BR>
domains that resemble the binding sites through which bacteria gain<BR>
entry into the cells lining the intestinal tract.  Thus, these sugars<BR>
can intercept bacteria forming harmless complexes that the baby<BR>
excretes. <BR>
<BR>
.... &quot;<BR>
<BR>
Presumably then, FOS or Fructo-Oligiosaccharides are a form of this<BR>
molecule derived from fruit rather than breast milk.  Who knows if it<BR>
works as well, or has any impact on an adult's gut.<BR>

<BR>
FOS is Fructo-Oligiosaccharides, also they can be synthetically made or<BR>
extracted.  They are extracted from Jerusalem Artichokes and often labelling<BR>
will use the listing as Jerusalem Artichoke to justify the FOS, rather than<BR>
list it directly.  In checking sometime ago with Elaine about FOS, it seems<BR>
that it is just as its name implies - another sugar.  Without insisting
on<BR>
one way or the other, we believe that Elaine's suggestion of being &quot;label<BR>
wary&quot; and, as the book states about being &quot;fanatical&quot; holds
true.  Rather<BR>
than take a chance, it is best to avoid it completely.  <BR>
