<B>Acne</B><BR>
 Tue, 22 Apr 1997 14:31:39 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi everyone! I wrote to a couple of people about acne and no one<BR>
responded. I guess I will e-mail the group maybe I will get a response.
 I<BR>
have had acne since I was about 17 years old. I have noticed when I have
a<BR>
flare that the acne is not as bad. I feel good and the acne is coming out<BR>
as strong as ever. I have gone to dermatologists in the past and even<BR>
tried over the counter drugs nothing worked. One dermatologist said to
me<BR>
in the past &quot;summer is coming up you will be going to the beach and
getting<BR>
some sun that will cover up some of the acne&quot;. Let me tell you that
was<BR>
not the answer that I was looking for, and the acne didn't clear up. I
did<BR>
by the way get off prednisone about a month ago, I was only on it for about<BR>
21/2 months. Someone mentioned going to a homeopath for blemishes or<BR>
rashes. Is it a good idea to see a homeopath for acne? How would I know<BR>
if the homeopath will be good for the acne problem. I really don't want
to<BR>
try 10 different homeopaths until I find the right one. Does anyone have<BR>
any suggestions on picking the right one, or any type of treatment that<BR>
helped them that could help me.<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>
<BR>

Hi Jim,<BR>
<BR>
I too am a fellow acne sufferer. Although with me, mine started around<BR>
the time my bowel problems started. Pesky issue though. I hate it. <BR>
Lately I have been aware that, even unrelated to major bowel symptoms,<BR>
mine gets better when I don't eat certain foods. I'm still trying to<BR>
figure out exactly what those are, but my acne seemed to come up lately<BR>
when I ate a bunch of dried dates. I am assuming there is some<BR>
leaky-gut/autoimmune involvement here for me. But this is just me, your<BR>
problem may be different since it's been so long term. That is so odd<BR>
that it gets better when you have a flare. <BR>
<BR>
Just to give you a little of my personal finds, the chinese system of<BR>
medicine refers to acne as &quot;stomache heat,&quot; I don't know why.
 Just<BR>
intrigues me, since we have these digestive troubles. About homeopaths,<BR>
my husband is a homeopath and a pretty good one, but he's terrible with<BR>
skin issues so I imagine one does have to find someone who is<BR>
specifically good with skin. They seem to all have their forte, and<BR>
their weak areas, even though few will admit what their weak areas are,<BR>
bad for marketing, I guess. :) It's so hard to find one that works.<BR>
<BR>
 In general, I think word of mouth works well with these things. The<BR>
good ones are always the most popular. I would say, look for someone<BR>
who has been practicing a minimum of ten years. Depending on the area<BR>
you live in, you will probably have several to choose from and will most<BR>
likely have to call 'em up and ask them some questions. Ask them what<BR>
their track record is with acne and other skin issues. They should be<BR>
civil when you talk to them on the phone and not try to sell you a load<BR>
of cr** about other things, as in &quot;Well, to really help you, we should<BR>
do hair analysis....&quot; They should also be really honest about how
long<BR>
they figure it will take to help. I say, give anyone up to three<BR>
session to see if it helps, no more than that if you get no results. The<BR>
good homeopaths should be able to effect some change within one<BR>
session. I guess my standards are pretty high because I have really<BR>
experienced how it can work. Really, homeopathy is quite amazing when<BR>
it works. While I was in Mexico I got a nasty rash on my lip. My<BR>
husband suggested a remedy and within fifteen minutes the thing was<BR>
going down right before my very eyes (and I was feeling pretty cynical<BR>
that it would help since skin stuff is not my husband's forte). <BR>
<BR>
Well, I hope this has been helpful.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
Denise<BR>

Hi Jim!<BR>
<BR>
I don't really know how to pick a good dermatologist but you might be<BR>
able to find out on Dr. Weil's webpage --<BR>
<A HREF="http://wwww.hotwired.com/drweil/97/01/index0a.html">http://wwww.hotwired.com/drweil/97/01/index0a.html</A><BR>
<BR>
Dr. Weil is a medical doctor who has studied alternative/holistic<BR>
medicine for years. He doesn't believe that conventional medicine<BR>
should be thrown out. He believes in the marriage of conventional<BR>
medicine and alternative/holistic medicine. I guess this is what makes<BR>
me trust him. <BR>
<BR>
There is a search engine on the page (called Database) and you can see<BR>
what he recommends for acne and/or you can get a referral. I was<BR>
looking for a biofeedback therapist and I got the name of a referring<BR>
agency, Biofeedback Certification Institute of America. I contacted<BR>
them and they sent me list of qualified therapists in my state.<BR>
<BR>
Now I don't have pervasive acne but about 1 or 2 times per month I used<BR>
to get these huge pimples on my chin or cheek. Then a few months ago I<BR>
heard about this new discovery on CNN about yogurt killing the pimple<BR>
bacteria. And of course the major manufacturers are looking into ways<BR>
to bottle that active component that's in the yogurt so they can<BR>
repackage it in little tiny bottles and put a big price on it. Soooooo,<BR>
anyway, I eat my homemade yogurt everyday and I just started saving the<BR>
last teaspoon for my face. I leave it on for about 20 minutes in the<BR>
morning just before I take my shower. I haven't had a pimple since. <BR>
Try it and let me know.<BR>
<BR>

Thanks everyone for your response on the acne!!!!!<BR>
I found one thing that did work that Nora Colleen wrote. Yogurt helped me<BR>
so much and it has only been one week since I tried it! I eat the yogurt<BR>
faithfully everyday, but I never thought of putting it on my face. I do<BR>
this everyday for about twenty minutes before taking my shower. It makes<BR>
so much sense it helps the gut why not the skin. Thanks again to everyone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>

<BR>
The same thing happens with me Jim and I am 32 years old. It's a bit<BR>
embarrasing to still be wrestling with it at this age. Nevertheless, I have<BR>
found that the same pattern with a number of other symptoms. ulcers, heavy<BR>
legs and headaches/spacey-foggy feelings. These I believe are related to
an<BR>
incomplete healing of the gut wall. when the diarrhea stops and stools are<BR>
formed, they spend more time in the gut and the amount of auto-intoxication<BR>
from the products they contain increases. I have found that if you increase<BR>
your fibre and alkaline/calcium rich foods (Carrot, Pumpkin,Squash, lettuce<BR>
cabbage), and avoid foods that leave a phosphorus residue the problem can<BR>
be alleviated. Always balance your meals. have smaller portions of meat
and<BR>
nuts and increase your serves of fruit, veges in particular and the<BR>
yoghurt. The best answer to this problem is SLIPPERY ELM 4 times a day and<BR>
PSYLIIUM 2 times.<BR>
Important - with these two you must increase your water intake or you can<BR>
get constipated. an increase in your water intake will help your kidneys
to<BR>
handle the toxic load. 3-4 glasses on rising and at least 4-5 other glasses<BR>
throughout the day.<BR>
you will notice a big difference in how you feel in 2-3 days. in a 3-4<BR>
weeks you should notice a difference in your skin.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>These notes ring big bells with me! I am new to the list and planning to
 start the diet soon. I have ulcerative colitis diagnosed in my early 20's
 after taking antibiotics for years for acne.
<BR>
<BR>
 After I had colitis and the acne was getting worse, I took accutane for 3
 mos. And it did take care of the acne for good. But, by then I'm sure the
 damage to my colon was done. For me, I'm positive there is a connection
 between the colitis and the antibiotics. And, 
 for me there's another problem, the years of antibiotics have made me immune
 to so many. I had pneumonia a few years ago and it was tough to find an
 antibiotic that fought it for me.

  &lt;&lt; I developed U.C. six years ago when I turned thirty. I have

   mostly an assortment of Asacol and Sulfa drugs with an ocassional
   Courtenema. I have my own theory as to how I got this temporary
 setback.
   When I was younger (In college at the time, oh incidently, I am a
 Software
   engineer, I was reading some of the messages about the connection
 between
   computers and IBD). To make a long story short, I had a face full
 of acne.
   I went to several dermatologists that perscribed antibiotics. I
 took them
   every day for several years. I believe that they upset the balance
 in my
   intestines so much that I now have U.C. and that it only manifested
 itself
   when I reached my thirties &gt;&gt;
 
 <BR>
<BR>
  Ted,<BR><BR> Your story is frighteningly similar to mine. I have Acne, I am a
 Software Engineer, and I contracted UC about 4 years ago at the age of 34 after about
  10 years of steadily taking antibiotics(Minocycline mostly, Tetracycline and
  others too) to control the acne. <BR><BR>
  I have been on the diet for nearly 3 months now, and it is FINALLY
 kicking in just now. I stopped the Minocycline when I began the diet, and I now
 feel that it was killing both the GOOD and BAD bacteria in my digestive tract,
 and therefore slowing down the healing from the diet.<BR><BR>
  Whereas most people see some pretty good results within a month, it
 took much longer for the diet to help me. My new GI told me I had one of the most
  severe cases of UC he had seen back in October before I found the
 SCD. I got very discouraged when the diet did not work well for me after a few
 weeks, but I stuck to it. Remember, YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT WITH FANATICAL
 ADHERENCE or it won't work. It also takes longer to kick in for some.
 <BR><BR>
  And by the way, I am now taking Accutane for the Acne. This is another very
  controversial drug, but my Acne is now severe, and I feel that I need to try
  this. It does not appear to be causing any problems with my UC after 1 month.<BR>
<BR>This is a great place to discuss the trials and tribulations of IBD 
related problems.<BR><BR>Brian

Subject: <B>strange acne </B><BR>
<P>Hi Guys;
<BR> Yet another acne question......  I have a strange case of acne. It
is localized to the back of my neck. I get the real deep big one's that
erupt like Mt. St. Helens. The strange thing is that I hardly get any on my
face. I was wondering if anyone has had this experience. It seems to me
that there must be a reason for this to be happening.
 <BR> I have been on the SCD diet for almost five weeks. During that time I
have been drinking alot of diet soda. This soda is sweetened with
nutrasweet. I see from other postings that maybe I should avoid this. The
problem is that I am trying to kill off any candida (if I have it, I dont
want to leave any stone unturned). Therefore I cannot drink any fruit juice
or anything that has alot of honey. Does anyone have a sure fire test for
candida? I am assuming that I have a candida problem since I took mega
amounts of antibiotics when I was in college 10 years ago. All comments and
suggestions would be appreciated. <BR>
<P>Thanks <BR>
Ted <BR>

<P>It is very important to drink 8 to 12 glasses of water daily, depending
on your weight. 8 eight ounce glasses plus one extra glass for every 25
pounds overweight you are. It is a much better beverage of choice than
pop, or coffee or juice as it requires no digestion and purifies your
system. I recommend trying this and see if your acne or skin blemishes
clear up.
