<BR>
=&gt;My symptoms were extremely minor (providing I stay diligently on the<BR>
Azulfidine). For 2-3 weeks, I was the best I had been in years, but<BR>
rapidly moved to being worse than I had been in even more years.<BR>

<BR>
Wished I could have reviewed your study before going on the Diet!<BR>
<BR>
I have UC - 4 outbreaks in 10 years. My only symptoms are bleeding -<BR>
sometimes quite severely. Originally only the lower 12 inches of the<BR>
colon was involved - now it is 25 inches. Never any pain or diahrrea,<BR>
probably due to a high fiber vegetarian diet for 15 years.<BR>
<BR>
Started the Diet June 1 and stayed on it 2 months exactly. At that<BR>
point I had brought myself from severe bleeding to just streaks on the<BR>
stool, using other, natural means. Couldn't clear up the last of it<BR>
though, and thought I would try her diet.<BR>
<BR>
I eliminated everything she listed. I normally do not eat dairy or<BR>
meat, and so did not include those, but otherwise followed her<BR>
recommendations without deviating at all. No cheating. I think I<BR>
stopped all my vitamins at first and then gradually went back to taking<BR>
a multi-mineral (1000 mgs of calcium, 500 magnesium, etc.) Vit. E 400,<BR>
Vitamin C varies usually 500 to 1000 mgs. and a Super B complex based on<BR>
50 mgs. B1, B2 etc.<BR>
<BR>
I am female, 49 years old. A naturopathic doctor gave me<BR>
Gottshall's book, so he does approve. Don't go to MD's except every<BR>
once in a while for a sigmoidoscopy. Don't use drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the Diet did not clear up the bleeding. Once or<BR>
twice I was clear, but over the 2 month period I would have to say it<BR>
didn't help. However, for people with the usual symptoms of pain and<BR>
diarrhea, it may be worth a try. I did notice a lessening of gas, my<BR>
only benefit.<BR>

<P><BR>
<BR>
How long have you been on the diet?:<BR>
About 2.5 weeks - got the boo,k before then, but had a trip<BR>
to Russia - hard to control the diet there.<BR>
<BR>
Age?:<BR>
<BR>
34<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Male or Female?:<BR>
<BR>
Male<BR>
<BR>
Do you have Crohn's, UC, or IBS?:<BR>
UC<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How long have you had the disease (In years &amp; months)?:<BR>
Since april 96 - just a few months - had a pretty nasty summer<BR>
till I got diagnosed early in August.<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, how religiously do you follow the diet? (1 meaning<BR>
cheating all the time, 10 meaning never cheating):<BR>
I'd say I am at a 9.5 - if I do cheat it is a bite of a muffin<BR>
or something like that.<BR>
<BR>
What medications are you also taking at the same time you are on the diet?<BR>
<BR>
The sulfer based one, Azulfadine.<BR>
<BR>
What supplements/vitamins are you also taking at the same time you are on
the<BR>
diet?<BR>
<BR>
Vitamin A, B complex, C *AND* taking Acidofilous. Get the f vitamins<BR>
without sugar, yeast, starch fillers.<BR>
<BR>
Do you eliminate or avoid any foods other than those listed in the book?<BR>
<BR>
I am following the book religiously. Have not added others yet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Are there any foods that the diet disallows, which you still eat because
they<BR>
don't seem to bother you?<BR>
Haven't tried yet.<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, 1 meaning no improvement, 10 meaning all symtoms are
gone<BR>
since following the diet; How much do you feel the diet has helped your<BR>
symptoms?:<BR>
I'd say I'm at a 6.5 - 7 or so. Yes in three weeks. I think it is mostly<BR>
the diet i since I wa s on my medicine while in Russia - no help.<BR>
<BR>
Would you recommend the diet to other people with IBD?:<BR>
I would definitely give it a whirl for anybody who has not tried it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does your doctor know you are following the diet?:<BR>
Have not talked o to him yet since I have not seen him since<BR>
diagnosed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If so, does he have an opinion on it (approve, disapprove, comments)?:<BR>
<BR>

How long have you been on the diet?:<BR>
<BR>
6 months<BR>
<BR>
Age?:<BR>
<BR>
34<BR>
<BR>
Male or Female?:<BR>
<BR>
Male<BR>
<BR>
Do you have Crohn's, UC, or IBS?:<BR>
<BR>
Crohn's of the colon<BR>
<BR>
How long have you had the disease (In years &amp; months)?:<BR>
<BR>
20 years<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, how religiously do you follow the diet? (1 meaning<BR>
cheating all the time, 10 meaning never cheating):<BR>
<BR>
9!<BR>
<BR>
If you ever &quot;cheat&quot; on the diet, what foods are you eating that
are not on the<BR>
diet, and what happens (symptoms if any) when you do?<BR>
<BR>
When eating out, I sometimes eat foods to which in themselves are not<BR>
disallowed, but which are often sold with added disallowed ingredients.
If <BR>
these foods are so adulterated, I may develop diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I have often cheated by eating too much raw fruits/vegetables (allowed<BR>
on the diet, but restricted until diarrhea is under control) and some other<BR>
things too soon, paying for it with diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
What medications are you also taking at the same time you are on the diet?<BR>
<BR>
Asacol tablets and Rowasa (suppositories) for CD itself.<BR>
Cipro and Flagyll (both tablets) for anal fistulas.<BR>
<BR>
Has your medication regime or dosages changed within 1-2 months of starting
the<BR>
diet (either before or after starting)?<BR>
<BR>
Yes. I changed from Azulfidine to Asacol shortly before the diet.<BR>
I just added the Rowasa a few days ago.<BR>
<BR>
Do you feel your change in symptoms (if any) was due to the diet, or your<BR>
medications, or both?<BR>
<BR>
I don't believe that the change from Azulfidine to Asacol made much of a
<BR>
difference. (It may actually be hurting me, since Asacol contains lactose
--<BR>
a complex carbohydrate). Within days on the diet, it greatly reduced my
<BR>
diarrhea. Rowasa seems to be reducing it further.<BR>
<BR>
What supplements/vitamins are you also taking at the same time you are on
the<BR>
diet, how long have you been taking them, and do you feel they help?<BR>
<BR>
For 5-6 months -<BR>
Multi-vitamin/mineral, and B-12 - seem to give more energy and improve <BR>
overall health<BR>
<BR>
For 1-2 months -<BR>
Biotin and Garlic&amp;Parsley - really seems to help, presumably by (the
biotin<BR>
and garlic killing off fungi, such as yeasts (the parsley deodorizes the
<BR>
garlic)<BR>
Digestive Enzymes - help to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates
<BR>
<BR>
Describe your diet/eating habits before you went on the SCD?<BR>
<BR>
A low-fat, medium-to-high-carbohydrate diet (what would generally be<BR>
considered a healthy diet). However, I did often have a daily doughnut<BR>
(which is a notoriously unhealthy food), since they are offerred free at<BR>
our morning break time.<BR>
<BR>
Do you eliminate or avoid any foods other than those listed in the book?<BR>
<BR>
Avoid blueberries<BR>
Limit grapes/raisins<BR>
<BR>
Are there any foods that the diet disallows, which you still eat because
they<BR>
don't seem to bother you?<BR>
<BR>
No<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, 1 meaning no improvement, 10 meaning all symtoms are
gone<BR>
since following the diet; How much do you feel the diet has helped your<BR>
symptoms?:<BR>
<BR>
9!<BR>
<BR>
Would you recommend the diet to other people with IBD?:<BR>
<BR>
ABSOLUTELY!<BR>
<BR>
Does your doctor know you are following the diet?:<BR>
<BR>
Yes.<BR>
<BR>
If so, does he have an opinion on it (approve, disapprove, comments)?: <BR>
<BR>
He does admit that &quot;Too many complex carbohydrates have been shown
to cause <BR>
diarrhea (in IBD patients).&quot; However, he seems to think that their
total<BR>
avoidance (as on the diet) is unnecessarily extreme.<BR>
<BR>
How did you find out about the diet?:<BR>
<BR>
On the World Wide Web.<BR>
<BR>
Any other comments about the diet plan?:<BR>
<BR>
I wish doctors would become more aware of it. Hopefully, the results of<BR>
this<BR>
survey are something we can show them to enlighten them. Following the diet<BR>
has forced me to become more disciplined and self-controlled, which is<BR>
helpful to me in other areas of my life.<BR>

How long have you been on the diet?:<BR>
<BR>
@ 5 months<BR>
Age?: 35<BR>
<BR>
Male or Female?: Female<BR>
<BR>
Do you have Crohn's, UC, or IBS?: UC<BR>
<BR>
How long have you had the disease (In years &amp; months)?: 6 years<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, how religiously do you follow the diet? (1 meaning<BR>
cheating all the time, 10 meaning never cheating):<BR>
<BR>
Around an 8<BR>
<BR>
If you ever &quot;cheat&quot; on the diet, what foods are you eating that
are not on the<BR>
diet, and what happens (symptoms if any) when you do?<BR>
<BR>
I cheat on little things, mostly condiments: xanathan gum in salad<BR>
dressings, soy sauce, probably some sugar in salad dressings when I go out
to<BR>
eat, also there is probably sugar in some of the sauces that are on other<BR>
foods.<BR>
Mostly when I eat out. There is also a candy that uses fruit sweetener (malted<BR>
milk balls and chocolate covered almonds) that are probably questionable,
but I<BR>
figure it's the lesser of an evil and it makes it more tolerable. Also,
one<BR>
major cheat is that I add white rice to my diet. So, I also eat a product<BR>
called Rice Dream that is similar to ice cream (rice syrup and fruit<BR>
sweeteners).<BR>
<BR>
Symptoms? If I eat a whole bunch of malted milk balls or Rice Dream, I<BR>
get a little &quot;gurgly&quot; and can tell that my colon is somewhat irritated,
but<BR>
it's<BR>
not a big deal.<BR>
<BR>
What medications are you also taking at the same time you are on the diet?<BR>
<BR>
Asacol. 2 pills 2x per day. 3x per day if I am having symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
Has your medication regime or dosages changed within 1-2 months of starting
the<BR>
diet (either before or after starting)?<BR>
<BR>
No.<BR>
<BR>
Do you feel your change in symptoms (if any) was due to the diet, or your<BR>
medications, or both?<BR>
<BR>
Oh yes. I was recovering from a flare up when I started the diet. My<BR>
appetite had been bad, with a constant dull nausea for about 2 months. My<BR>
appetite came back, the nausea disappeared, within 2 weeks.<BR>
<BR>
What supplements/vitamins are you also taking at the same time you are on
the<BR>
diet, how long have you been taking them, and do you feel they help?<BR>
<BR>
None.<BR>
<BR>
Describe your diet/eating habits before you went on the SCD?<BR>
<BR>
Very high carb, high grain vegetarian.<BR>
<BR>
Do you eliminate or avoid any foods other than those listed in the book?<BR>
<BR>
Peanuts and peanut butter seem to give me a problem. Also, I will not<BR>
touch beans and legumes. They give me gas, bloating and diarrhea no matter
how<BR>
much I soak and rinse. I also avoid coffee, drinking decaf a couple of time
a<BR>
month.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any foods that the diet disallows, which you still eat because
they<BR>
don't seem to bother you?<BR>
<BR>
White rice. This includes cream of rice cereal, rice milk and Rice Dream<BR>
(mentioned above).<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, 1 meaning no improvement, 10 meaning all symtoms are
gone<BR>
since following the diet; How much do you feel the diet has helped your<BR>
symptoms?:<BR>
<BR>
Around an 8. Gas and bloating has all but disappeared, I have had days<BR>
of actual &quot;normal&quot; bowel movements, normal appetite.<BR>
<BR>
Would you recommend the diet to other people with IBD?: Yes<BR>
<BR>
Does your doctor know you are following the diet?: Yes<BR>
<BR>
If so, does he have an opinion on it (approve, disapprove, comments)?:<BR>
<BR>
Yes. His words: &quot;it's always better to control this with diet.&quot;
He<BR>
cautioned me that the disease was very idiosyncratic, and to allow for<BR>
individual differences. Also, give it plenty of time.<BR>
<BR>
How did you find out about the diet? Compuserve Natural Health Forum.<BR>
<BR>
Any other comments about the diet plan?: Not too hard to deal with, once
you<BR>
get<BR>
used to it.<BR>
