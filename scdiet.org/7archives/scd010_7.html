Hi Christina,<BR>
<BR>
Chocolate , even unsweetened is a definite no-no. Elaine has not given the<BR>
reason for this. If you do all the research in the papers in the back of<BR>
the book, you'll probably find the answer. I found one good reason in a<BR>
book I have which says that the oxalic acid in chocolate prevents the<BR>
absorption of essential minerals: Calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium.<BR>
It acts like a magnet, reacting with them to form insoluble salts that<BR>
cannot be utilised by the body. He concludes that giving chocolate milk
to<BR>
kids is an exercise in futility if you want to increase their calcium<BR>
intake.<BR>
<BR>
The same applies to spinach (cooked only) and rhubarb. I know however that<BR>
spinach (and sliverbeet) if taken raw or lightly blanched, do not form<BR>
oxalic acid.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
TO EVERYONE: The best honey to buy is un-pasteurized because it contains
all the natural good enzymes and anti-bacterial anti-viral properties. Do
not give it to babies or young children though. Try as hard as you can to
only buy honey in a GLASS jar. This goes for OILS too. <BR>
Most people don't know this, because it is not very publicized, but plastic
leaches into the foods that are stored in it, especially oils. <BR>
It may sound far fetched, but I have seen programs on this, and scientists
have proved it. They don't know which plastics are harmful and which are
not, therefore, all plastics should be avoided when it comes to food storage,
and cooking. If you cook in the microwave, use glass or ceramic. <BR>
Always try to use glass or ceramic for all food storage. <BR>
As far as the diet is concerned, there is nothing against using any type
of honey, but un-pasteurized is the best. <BR>

<BR>
<TT>&gt;What is unfiltered &quot;Clover Honey&quot;?? Is this allowed in the
SCD?</TT><BR>
<BR>
Don,<BR>
Clover honey just means the bees used clover flowers to make the honey.
I<BR>
don't know what &quot;unfiltered&quot; means exactly. The best honey to
get is 
Unpasteurized because it contains all the antibiotic, antibacterial properties 
and all the good enzymes we need. Pasteurized honey is dead. Either one
is ok 
on the SCD. As long as the ingredients on the jar don't list anything besides 
honey, it's fine. Always buy honey in a GLASS JAR, not a plastic container.
<BR>
Chemicals from the plastic can leach into the honey, and the effects of
this 
are not fully known, but some plastics have been proven harmful. Glass is
best 
for all food containers, but especially for OILS and all liquid foods and 
drinks.<BR>

<BR>
All honey should be unprocessed. Sue bee is probably filtered but that's<BR>
fine. In the US, almost no honey has anything added to it. Check the<BR>
label, and it should just say honey. Did you know honey is also a<BR>
natural antiseptic and can be stored un refrigerated and fine for<BR>

buckwheat honey sometime, it's dark colored, almost black and SO good!!!<BR>

I read the article. Have you ever tasted buckwheat honey?<BR>
That's the darkest and healthiest according to the research.I thought it was<BR>
yucky!<BR>
It was on sale at the healthy foods store recently and i bought some,<BR>
I now have an unused jar of organic buckwheat honey. ; / It tastes too too strong<BR>
for use in the baking recipes or for honey sauces. I mind the overpowering flavor.<BR>

<BR>
Checked out the honey article and thought I'd add a couple of things the<BR>
article didn't mention.<BR>
<BR>
1. You shouldn't consume large amounts of honey if you have a candida<BR>
infection, they thrive on it.<BR>
<BR>
2. In addition to it's antioxidant properties, honey is a natural<BR>
anisceptic, put it on a cut or burn for similar results to peroxide, but<BR>
without drying out the skin, its sort of an antiseptic lotion. Royal<BR>
Jelly works even better for this (the BEST thing to put on a new tatoo!)<BR>
<BR>
3. Honey loses most of it's advantagageous antioxidant and anticeptic<BR>
properties when cooked. Some claim it even becomes slightly toxic. In<BR>
dishes that don't bake, like things cooked on the stove, I would add the<BR>
honey last when possible, maybe when things are still warm but off the<BR>
burner.<BR>
<BR>
4. The article compares darker and lighter honey of different flowers'<BR>
pollens. It recommends buckwheat pollen and so do I. If you haven't<BR>
tasted this stuff, do. It is SO good, I like it a lot better than clover<BR>
honey.<BR>

On the subject of honey - there has been a lot recently in the Australian<BR>
news about the amazing properties of honey, especially Australian Jellybush<BR>
Honey and New Zealand Manuka Honey.  They are both actually being used in<BR>
hospital burns units and also on chronic skin ulcers, with remarkable<BR>
effects. The honey must be raw and unprocessed to retain its virtues. I<BR>
would suppose it has similar healing effects on our insides, but would<BR>
recommend eating it sparingly.<BR>

<P>Hi Everyone,
<P>I copied and pasted this time - the post from the BARF (Bones And Raw
Food) list.
<P>Here it is:
<P>&gt; I just remembered something regarding commercial honey.  For
background I studied
Animal Science/Agriculture in college and spent two years studying bees
and beekeeping.
<P>&gt; Quite often, at least in America, the commercial companies will cut
honey with corn syrup
and it can still say honey on the label.  Others heat the honey to
much.  Heating over 107
degrees F. will kill the enzymes, destroy vitamins, etc.
<P>&gt; It has to be heated some to get it to come out of the comb.  Usually
103 or 104 is enough
and leaves a bit of leway incase some of it continues to heat after the
heat is turned off.
<P>&gt; 'Raw' honey has been handled this way.  You also need to heat it this
little bit so it will flow
through the strainer or you would have bits of bees, (the odd leg,
heads, etc.)  and other
foreign material that is present in the hive and gets into the honey
present in the bottle.
<P>Take care,
<P>Deborah

<P>Gee, I thought honey had nutrition in it.  Is there nothing good to be
said about honey, nutritionally speaking?  Okay, wait, I just got this
from the honey.com page:
<P>&quot;In addition to being a concentrated energy source, honey contains a
wide array of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and amino acids. In a
recent review of related literature, Dr. Susan Percival of the
University of Florida&iacute;s Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition
found honey contains vitamins, such as vitamin B6, thiamin, riboflavin
and pantothenic acid. Essential minerals, such as calcium, copper, iron,
magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and zinc are also
found in honey. &quot;In addition, several different amino acids, the
building blocks of protein, have been identified in honey.&quot; says Dr.
Percival. &quot;Honey also contains several compounds that function as
antioxidants, one of which is unique to honey called pinocembrin.&quot;
Although these substances appear in trace amounts and vary depending on
the honey&iacute;s floral source, they contribute to your overall nutrition
intake.&quot;
<P>What say ye?  After all, bee pollen is reknowned for having the complete
array of B vitamins in them, so I guess I figured honey would be
healthy?
<P>And here is an interesting honey factoid:  did you know honey NEVER
spoils.  There you go--your perfect Y2K bomb shelter food source.  =)

<P>Dear Michelle,
<P>Honey is good to use as a sweetener in moderation. I think that moderation
is the key, because too much suger, even SCD legal sugar, is not good for
us. It is proven to suppress the immune system.
<P>It can be misleading when you read about the antioxidents and proteins and
vitamins contained in a substance. This does not necessarily mean that they
are *good* for us. I believe chemical analysis of just about any plant or
animal product would have lots of these nutrients.

<P>Yes real unprocessed raw honey has nutrition and anti bacterial qualities.
<P>The honey with health benefits is very expensive and not for cooking (which
kills all the good stuff ). I use it as a medicinal remedy, I paid $4.50 for
a very small jar of &quot;Really Raw&quot; brand. It looks and tastes nothing like the
honey we use for cooking.
<P>&quot;Really Raw&quot; honey is straight from the hive, totally unprocessed,
unrefined, unfiltered and un-heated. It has crunchy bits of  propolis,
pollen and bee matter and honeycomb.
I took it by the tablespoon when i had a sore throat this winter.

&gt; <BR>
&gt; There are several recipes in the book that call for vanilla.  It seems,<BR>
&gt; however, that the ingredients on the package say that either corn syrup
or<BR>
&gt; sugar are added.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Is it possible to get vanilla without those additives or has everyone
used<BR>
&gt; the &quot;store&quot; version with the sugar or corn syrup?</TT></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I've been using Spice Islands' &quot;Pure Vanilla Extract&quot; puchased
at Safeway. <BR>
 It's label says &quot;100% Bourbon Vanilla&quot;; it's ingredients list
is: &quot;Bourbon<BR>
Vanilla bean extractives in water and alcohol (35%)&quot;.  A note above
the<BR>
ingredients states: &quot;... all natural pure vanilla extract.   NO SUGAR<BR>
ADDED.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It may have unlisted ingredients, or the alcohol may be bad, but I've been<BR>
using it without apparent trouble.  I use it in baking according to the
SCD<BR>
recipes, and I add a drop to yogurt and honey.    While I doubt that any<BR>
single ingredient is essential, I think vanilla makes a noticeable and<BR>
welcome difference to baked sweets or yogurt.<BR>

I really wouldn't use the vanilla extract that has sweetener added!  You can

Walnut Acres  ( <A

Wed, 30 Apr 1997 21:34:59 GMT<BR>
<BR>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt;One quick question that I hope anyone will answer...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;In the book (page 27) it says we are allowed to have glucose and fructose<BR>
&gt;because they are the monosaccharides. Glucose and fructose both come
&gt;from<BR>
sucrose which is a disaccharide which we are not allowed. I'm o.k. &gt;with
this,<BR>
but I would like to know is... if I see a product saying &gt;&quot;glucose-fructose&quot;
on<BR>
the ingredients label does this mean it is sucrose in &gt;this case we cannot
have<BR>
it, or does it mean its composed of glucose and &gt;fructose and in this
case we<BR>
can have it?<BR>
&gt; Geoff Stewardson</FONT></TT><BR>
<BR>
Dear Geoff and others,<BR>
I cleared up this dilemna in the past by asking Elaine. In the most recently<BR>
printed edition of the book, it says NOT to have glucose or fructose anymore.
<BR>
The reason she gave me by fax was that there is too much mislabelling going
on.<BR>
She says that often they will sell mixtures of true fructose and sugar and<BR>
label it fructose, etc. She says we can use PURE DEXTROSE, which I was able
to<BR>
find at Galloway's in Vancouver, BC, Canada. It is a chain of stores that
sell<BR>
bulk foods, imported food items, spices, and health foods. It looks like<BR>
powdered confectioners sugar and is quite cheap ($1.19 for 400 grams which
is<BR>
just under 1/2 a pound) compared to Fructose. I have also seen it in East<BR>
Indian specialty food stores. I buy it and use it in homemade yogurt,<BR>
applesauce, jam, tea, etc. I still use HONEY a lot though, as I believe
it is<BR>
best. You see, I used to use granulated fructose since it said that you
could<BR>
in the old edition of the book. I never noticed any problems really, but
you<BR>
never know. I also used to buy drinks that listed Glucose-Fructose instead
of<BR>
sugar or corn syrup, like Snapple, before they changed the formula. Who
knows,<BR>
maybe it had corn syrup all along and they just recently changed the label.
<BR>
Anyhow, I still occasionally have one of these drinks, but Elaine does not<BR>
approve. She basically says NO GLUCOSE, OR FRUCTOSE. (yes, she always yells<BR>
everything in CAPS!) When I asked her Why not?, she told me the reason I
just<BR>
mentioned and said the only thing we could have was pure dextrose.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this clarifies things for everyone.<BR>

<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>FYI - sorry in advance for the spelling<BR>
<BR>
This article was taken from...<BR>
Health Naturally, issue 23, august/september 1996<BR>
<BR>
The following will be parts of the article and will not be all inclusive
by<BR>
any means. ***(PART 1)***<BR>
(NB: Most of these sweeteners are not permitted on the SCD, 
see <A HREF="scd010_7.html#ANCHOR01">note below</A>)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></TT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Natural Sweeteners<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Granulated cane juice</B> - is whole cane sugar, calories and all,
with the<BR>
water removed. It is only slightly healthier than table sugar because of<BR>
its small content if vitamins and minerals, which offsets the deleterious<BR>
offects of sugar. In small amounts, it is appropriate for health children<BR>
and adults.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Barley malt </B>- has very similar properties to the above sweetener and
is<BR>
sometimes a good alternative to table sugar. Some individuals, however,<BR>
react negatively to it because MSG is often hidden in the malt.<BR>
(Not permitted on the SCD, see <A HREF="scd010_7.html#ANCHOR01">note below</A>.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Molasses </B>- concentrated from sugar cane or beet sugar refinings,
rich in<BR>
nutrients like B, E, iron, calcium, Magnesium, potassium, chromium,<BR>
manganese and zinc. It is lower in sucrose that table sugar.Testimonials<BR>
abound for the healing effects of molasses on disorders like arthritis,<BR>
anemia, ulcers, varicose veins, constipation and low energy. Most brands<BR>
are preserved with sulphur, high doses of which can be toxic.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Date sugar </B>- is more a food than a sweetener. It is ground up from<BR>
dehydrated dates, is high in fibre, and a long list of vitamins and<BR>
minerals, including iron. Its use is limited by price and the fact it does<BR>
not dissolve when added to liquids.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Brown sugar </B>- is nothing more that 91 to 96 per cent white sugar
coated<BR>
molasses syrup. It is not healthier than white sugar.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Demerara, turbinado and saw sugar </B>- are variour grades of granulated,
dark<BR>
brown sugar obtained from the sugar cane juice. They retain some of the<BR>
nutrients of raw cane sugar but are not as nutrient-rich as granulated cane<BR>
juice or molasses.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Maple syrup</B> - is a naturally occuring sweetener which is, as best,
65 per<BR>
cent sucrose; it is basically a sugar equivalent with a similar biochemical<BR>
effect as raw, unpasteurized honey.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Stevia</B> - is a perennial shrub, the extracts of which have been used
for<BR>
centuries as a safe, natural. Stevia is 200 to 300 times sweeter than<BR>
sugar and has a licorice-like flavour. Virtually calorie-fre, stevia<BR>
prevents cavities and does not trigger a rise in blood sugar. It does not<BR>
feed yeast, fungi or other micro-organisms in the gastrointestinal tract,<BR>
but it does increase energy and improve digestion by stimulating the<BR>
pancreas. There has never been a report of an adverse reactin linked to<BR>
stevia. In 1991, the FDA banned stevia imports for use in foods,<BR>
reportedly at the request of an aspartame manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fruit juice and rice syrup</B> - are common sweeteners used for many<BR>
health-store packaged cereals, cookies and other products. Since both<BR>
still contain sugar, albeit natural with some vitamins and minerals, they<BR>
are still potentially a problem for diabetics and hypoglycemics.<BR>
(Not permitted on the SCD, see <A HREF="scd010_7.html#ANCHOR01">note below</A>)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Raw, unpasteurized honey</B> - is a good sugar alternative but only because
it<BR>
is considerably sweeter and people tend to use less of it. Its composition<BR>
is very similar to table sugar. In large amounts, honey is not a good<BR>
sugar substitute for either diabetics or hypoglycemics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Licorice root</B> - can be used as a natural sweetener in small amounts
without<BR>
serious adverse reactions. As a sweetener, licorice root is safe for<BR>
diabetics or hypoglycemics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Amazake</B> - is a natural disaccharide sweetener made from brown rice
with<BR>
similar characteristics to honey and rice syrup.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)</B> - are sucrose molecules linked in sequence<BR>
with fructose. They are found naturally in many vegies, grains and fruits.<BR>
FOS promote the growth of the beneficial gut bacteria (lactobacillus<BR>

<BR>
there is a article reprinted from Health Naturally called Natural<BR>
Sweeteners[sic]. Included in it are:<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Barley malt<BR>
<BR>
This has gluten and would not be permitted on the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;rice syrup<BR>
<BR>
This is made by using an enzyme to break down the rice starch to a sugar.<BR>
Often the enzyme is barley malt, resulting in a rice syrup with gluten.
The<BR>
best known rice syrup with gluten is the one used in the Rice Dream liquid.<BR>
This product is not gluten-free. Any product with rice syrup listed<BR>
requires a call to the manufacturer to determine how it was made.<BR>
<BR>
The way they are listed at the site implies they are recommended.<BR>

Sucralose</B> - 600 times the sweetning power of sugar.  Not yet FDA approved,
it is lefally in use in Canada and Australia under the brand name Splenda. 
There have so far veen no reports of adverse effects, possibly because of
its expense and limited use.
<BR><BR><B>
Cyclamates</B> - were banned by the FDA in 1970 due to their association with
cancer - but not in Canada where seemingly, people do not get cancer from
them.
<BR><BR><B>
Saccharine</B> - contains only one eighth calorie per teaspoon, is about 300
times sweeter than sugar, and has a noticeably bitter aftertaste.  Also
linked with cancer, saccharine is banned in the U.S.  In Canada, it is only
available from pharmacists, who keep it under the counter and dispense it
to anyone who asks.
<BR><BR><B>
Aspartame</B> - it has a long history of controversy with some authors calling
it the most dangerous substance on the market.  Aspartame causes over 75
per cent of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA. 
Reactions incluse seizures and death.  High levels of the amino acids
phenylalanine and aspartic acid (both in aspartaime) can cause brain
neurotransmitter imbalances, leading to numerous side effects on the
nervous system.  Methanol (wood alcohol) is 10 per cent of aspartame and a
deadly poison capable of causing blindness of death.  Methanol breaks down
into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body.  Formaldehyde is a
well-known neurotoxin and carcinogen; it causes retinal damage and
interferes with DNA replication.  It is also manufactured by overgrown
candida in the gastrointestinal tract.  To date, there have been no studies
to evaluate the dangers of chronically ingesting methanol from aspartame. 
Aspartame has been documented to cause low brain serotonin levels,
depression and other emotional disorders that are often reversed by
stopping aspartame.  These results have been reported in people using as
little as four 16-ounce bottles of diet soda per day.

<TT><FONT SIZE=-1><BR>
Here are some of the 90 different documented adverse effects of aspartame:
<P>
headaches/migrains, dizziness, seizures, nausea, numbness, muscle spasms,
weight gain, rashes, depression, fatigue, irritability, tachycardia,
insomnia, vision problems,hearing loss, heart palpitations, breathing
difficulties, asthma, anxiety attacks, slurred speach, loss of taste,
tinnitus, vertigo, memory loss, joint pain and death.

<BR>
To all, <BR>
Saccharin is by no means SAFE at all. I remember in high school I did a<BR>
research essay on artificial sweeteners. The fact is that every single<BR>
artificial sweetener has been proven to cause cancer in rats, not to mention<BR>
other health problems. Some artificial sweeteners were even banned in the<BR>
States, and still are banned in Canada. I believe cyclamates are one of
them. <BR>
I wish I had that essay in front of me now, but I'm just working from an
old<BR>
memory. I think it was cyclamates which were banned and then reinstated,
but<BR>
it could be saccharin. You can't even get cyclamates anymore in Canada,
but<BR>
you can in the States. You can't even buy soda pop with saccharin in Canada,<BR>
but you can in the States. Anyway, the latest of the artificial sweeteners<BR>
like aspartame, just haven't been around long enough yet for society to
realize<BR>
that they cause serious health problems. I see no reason for anyone to consume<BR>
these un-natural chemicals. They are not foods. If someone told you to eat<BR>
sawdust because it was a good source of fiber, would you do it? It is not
a<BR>
food and neither are saccharin and all other artificial sweeteners. They
are<BR>
made up of molecules that are not even recognized by the human body and
do not<BR>
exist anywhere in nature. Is this something you want to eat? Have you heard<BR>
the latest NON-food, fake fat. They have even approved it for the public<BR>
market, yet it has been PROVEN to cause diarreah, and gastro symptoms that<BR>
sound like IBD. Eating the stuff is like asking for a disease. I personally<BR>
would AVOID them all. Honey is the best thing.<BR>

<B>Re: Dextrose</B><BR>
Fri,  9 May 1997 20:09:47 GMT<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><TT>&gt;Anna (and everyone),<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;In my edition of Elaine's book it says (page 59):<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;... DO NOT USE FRUCTOSE OR GLUCOSE SYRUP NOR POWDERED OR GRANULATED<BR>
&gt;FRUCTOSE, GLUCOSE OR DEXTROSE.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Reading the text that follows I would imagine that if one is absolutely
sure<BR>
&gt;that the label is correct there would be no problem, but on the other
hand<BR>
&gt;Elaine never says it like she says in other similar situations (e.g.
apple<BR>
&gt;cider (page 56)). And there is also the fact that she wrote all that
in<BR>
&gt;capitals.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;What do you have to say to all this? I'm very interested about your
opinion<BR>
&gt;because today I saw some plastic sacs with fructose inside and it looked
just<BR>
&gt;like sugar. Maybe your answer will give me courage to try it (obviously,
never<BR>
&gt;before being certain of its content).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks,<BR>

Dear Joaquim,<BR>
You have the new edition of the book.  The old edition didn't have that
written<BR>
in it, and it inadvertently said that we could use Glucose, Fructose or
any<BR>
combination of the two.  It also said that Dextrose was the same as glucose,<BR>
therefore you could infer that this was also allowable.  Back then, I used
to<BR>
buy granulated Fructose and use it.  It didn't always agree with me.  I
think<BR>
it caused gas, but I can't say for sure.  Anyway, when the new edition of
the<BR>
book came out, I happened to buy one for a friend with IBS and I browsed<BR>
through it to see if there were any changes since the older edition that
I had.<BR>
 I noticed that it now said what you quoted above about NO FRUCTOSE, ETC.
 It<BR>
was at that point that I started to worry because I had been using granulated<BR>
Fructose and so was another friend of mine with CD.  I faxed Elaine a letter<BR>
asking about it, and she faxed me back.  In the fax she sent me, she just
wrote<BR>
all over the margins of the letter I faxed her, with the answers to the<BR>
questions, and it was ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS.  I found this kind of rude,
but I<BR>
overlooked it because I figured she probably gets asked the same stupid<BR>
questions every day and she must get sick of answering them, especially
when<BR>
half the things people ask are explicitly of implicitly written in the book<BR>
itself.  Anyway, she said &quot;ONLY PURE DEXTROSE&quot; to the question
&quot; Can we have<BR>
granulated fructose, glucose, or dextrose?&quot;.  The reason given was
that<BR>
companies have been mislabelling mixtures of different sugars as Fructose.<BR>
<BR>
My advice to anyone, which is according to what Elaine told me, is to only
try<BR>
something labelled Dextrose - or Pure Dextrose.  And also, I wouldn't go<BR>
searching all over town for it, because it's just not worth it.  Honey is<BR>
perfectly sufficient, and actually healthier anyway.  If you happen to come<BR>
across dextrose, then try it, but Elaine says not to try Fructose.  I also<BR>
tried pure Glucose powder (from the same store), but I didn't like it because<BR>
it is less sweet, you need tons to give the same sweetness as sugar or honey<BR>
would, and it gets all chewy.  It doesn't disolve nicely or mix into things.
<BR>
It becomes hard as a rock and chewy when you mix it with liquid, so I gave
up<BR>
on it.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine seems to get annoyed when we ask if we can have all sorts of<BR>
alternatives to a food, like beans for example.  When I asked if the beans
and<BR>
lentils listed in the book were the only ones allowable, she replied: ISN'T<BR>
THAT ENOUGH!!!  I guess this goes for the dextrose/honey issue.  She seems
to<BR>
think we should be happy to be able to eat honey, let alone trying to find
some<BR>
other alternative.<BR>
Hope this info helps clear things up.<BR>

From: Deborah Idol &lt;cat@cloud9.net&gt;<BR>
To: SCD-list@longisland.com<BR>
Subject: <B>Re: SCD</B><BR>
<P>Hi Sherilyn and Nancy,
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><TT>&gt; You also wrote:
&gt; &Uacute;quot;I'm happy to say that I've been fanatically on the diet for
five days<BR>
&gt; now.  I know that's not a lot to most of you, but I'm SO proud of<BR>
&gt; myself!  It's really hard to avoid something you're addicted 
to.&Uacute;quot;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; No, it is not easy, but it gets easier the longer you stick with it.<BR>
&gt; Really.  The first days are the hardest, and as the diet changes over<BR>
&gt; from being an effort to being a habit a new frame of mind sets in.  The<BR>
&gt; addiction is in the process of being broken.<BR></TT></FONT>
<P>If anyone is having a really horrendously hard time staying on the diet, and
is *addicted* to sugar, I would suspect a candida overgrowth!  If that's the
case, those yeasties are going to cause *mighty* cravings for what *they*
need to grow and multiply and thrive.  Until I started taking massive doses
of colloidal silver which we make from a machine my son bought from
Csprosystems - <A HREF="http://www.csprosystems.com">http://www.csprosystems.com</A> 
- I had dreadful cravings for
sugar and symptoms galore of a massive yeast problem.  I wouldn't give
anyone medical advice, and this is just my own experience, but even taking
(double the usual dose) lamisil didn't help like the colloidal silver has
(of course I take the extra strength - run through the machine twice -
colloidal silver, and I drink *lots* of it every day).  I actually had
patches of yeast on my arms and legs after having been given the massive IV
dose of prednisone in the hospital, and after having inhaled the stuff for
years.  These are gone, without having applied anything topically, just from
having taken the colloidal silver, as are the cravings for sugar, the
spaciness, and a mulititude of other candida caused symptoms.  I am still
fighting it, even after a year of having no sugar, eating fruit only 3 or 4
times, and taking the silver every day (and this is after a previous four
months on lamisil), but I can finally see that one day it will be gone.
I'll never stop taking colloidal silver, as it kills viruses, bacterial
diseases, fungi, etc.
<P>And I would never go off the SCD, although I would also not go back to using
honey, as I have become convinced that high levels of sugar in the diet
promote every possible disease people can get, including cancer and heart
disease.  I encourage people to follow this diet forever, and never go back
to a conventional diet, even after a cure.  If one thinks about how we
evolved before agriculture, which has fed us for a mere 5,000 to 10,000 years
or so, during which we have not had time to adapt and evolve to thrive on a
grain based diet, one realizes that we did evolve on a diet rather similar
to the SCD (with the exception of large amounts of honey, which would have
been only a very occasional treat for pre agricultural man).  For eons, man
lived as a hunter gatherer, eating meat, fish, greens, berries, nuts and a
few tubers.  Outside of the tubers, this sounds like the SCD minus the dairy
products.  (We would probably all be better off without those, too ;-) ).
<P>Yes, it's very difficult to stay on a diet like this, especially at first or
if we have an overgrowth of organisms in our bodies causing us to crave
sugars and starches!  (And I would certainly love to get to the point where
I could eat a sauce every now and then, without worrying about the tiny bit
of flour that was used to thicken it!)  But it does get easier, especially
if any candida overgrowth is taken care of.
<P>Take care,
<P>Deborah

<P>What happens when you eat sugar? Read the following text about sugar's effect on your 
immunesystem at:
<P><A HREF="http://bcn.net/%7estoll/sugarimm.html">http://bcn.net/~stoll/sugarimm.html</A>
<BR><BR>
<B>Sugar and Immunity </B><BR><BR>
Leukocytic Index proves the devastating effect of refined carbohydrates on
immunity.<P>

Many people have been asking for a mechanism for the
depressed immunity seen in people who eat sugar and other
refined carbohydrates. Many are known but the Leukocytic
Index is an especially helpful one for many people to begin to
take this health risk seriously.<P>

More than 20 years ago a large study was published about
the effects of refined carbohydrates (of which sweets are the
worst) on the leukocytic index. Our white cells are the most
important factors in protecting us from invading organisms.
The leukocytic index is a measure of how many organisms
one white blood cell (WBC) can eat in an hour. Therefore an
index of 10 means that that one WBC ate 10 organisms in
THAT hour. <P>

The average LI (leukocytic index) in the USA--and
remember, average is not as healthy as one can get--is about
13.9. Within 15 minutes, after an individual eats the amount
of refined carbohydrates normally ingested in the evening
meal --about 100 grams, the leukocytic index drops to about
1.4. Depending on the genetic susceptibility to this problem,
it might be better or worse--this is just an average. Diabetics
ALWAYS have a LI of less than 2. <P>

That means: the average person loses more than 90% of their
immune function within 15 minutes of indulging in this
poisonous substance. This deficiency lasts for about 2 hours
after the stress occurs. <P>

What is routinely given intravenously during surgery? Glucose
water! When Ringer's Lactate (which has no sugar) is used
instead, the incidence of post operative infection is reduced
by two thirds. The only reason I can think of for this kind of
persistent ignorance is that there is no money in changing the
thinking of operative routine. There is a lot more money in
treating the infections that are created by the Allopathic
Monopoly. <P>

Since this has been known for more than 20 years, don't you
think it is time for this information to get out to the public?
This is one of the reasons I wrote my new book Saving
Yourself from the Disease-Care Crisis. Those interested
in practical ways to apply this kind of information to many of
the chronic conditions we MDs still consider "incurable"
should order a copy by calling the publisher at (800)
464-7034 and using their credit card. Single copies are $13
(which includes shipping and handling). Four or more copies
are $5/book and no charge for shipping and handling.

<P>Hi Lindsay,
<P>&gt;Thanks, Deborah, now I know that we have something to strive for when we
&gt;have mastered the basic diet!  It won't be so hard to figure out with you
&gt;helping.  What do you think about the phenomenon of &quot;craving
sugar?&quot;<P>
There are several reasons one could be craving sugar.  Hypoglycemia causes
sugar cravings when the blood sugar gets very low.  Candida overgrowth
causes overwhelming sugar cravings, as the yeasties need sugar to feed on.
Eating sugar causes cravings for more sugar, as sugar makes the blood sugar
spike and then crash, plus it makes the diner hungrier (an extremely hungry
person is more likely to succumb to the lure of sweets).  Fatigue and/or
depression often create cravings for sugar to give one an energy lift or
increase serotonin production.  One will have more energy, of course, on a
higher protein/low sugar diet, and this should help the mood, also.  In
addition, selenium, fish oil, B complex and other nutrients often eliminate
depression.
<P>Take care,
<P>Deborah
