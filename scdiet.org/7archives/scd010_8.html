          Elaine recommends vitamins from Freeda Vitamins in New York. Their number 

          is 800-777-3737. On the top of their price list it says that &quot;All 

          Formulas are 100% Yeast and Gluten Free&quot;.<br>

          &gt;&gt;<BR>

          &gt;&gt;Its that time of year. I just returned from the pharmacy with

          &gt;&gt;lozenges with vitamine C and Echinacea&quot; made by Nutri Power. 

          <BR>

          &gt;&gt;The ingredient list is very SCD-friendly except for the Echinacea. 

          Anybody know what<BR>

          &gt;&gt;Echinacea is? or if it is harmful?<BR>

          &gt;Hi Tim,<BR>

          &gt;Sorry, I don't know what Echinacea is either, however some time 

          back I was<BR>

          &gt;using a holistic massage therapist who gave me a list of vitamins 

          to take.<BR>

          &gt;I was able to find most everything on the list in legal form. Two 

          things<BR>

          &gt;brought on instant diahrea. Echinacea and 1000 mg of vitimin C.<BR>

          <BR>

          Hi all,<BR>

          Vitamin C is reknown for it's ability to bring on instant diarrhea when<BR>

          administered in megadoses. Better to have smaller separated doses. or<BR>

          better still eat foods that have the whole C complex built into them 

          free<BR>

          of charge. ie rutin etc. These help the C to be absorbed before it can<BR>

          start to cause irritation.<BR>

          <BR>

          I've never heard about this reaction with echinacea? did you take them<BR>

          together at the same time?<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">&gt;Hi everyone,<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;I am curious about this idea of iron supplementation.  Following a <BR>

&gt;recent posting on anemia, I browsed through Andrew Weil's book on <BR>

&gt;natural healing.  He claims that the only people who should take iron

<BR>

&gt;are those losing a lot of blood.  He says that the body cannot <BR>

&gt;otherwise rid itself of iron, and buildups can be toxic.<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;I wonder if there is &quot;invisible bleeding&quot; involved in ulcerative

<BR>

&gt;colitis; if at times of low inflammation the colon is still bleeding

<BR>

&gt;but the blood is not obvious or visible.  This might account for <BR>

&gt;ongoing anemia and the visible benefits of iron supplementation.<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;John<BR>

&gt;Berkeley, CA</FONT><BR>

<BR>

Dear John and others: <BR>

Andrew Weil is talking about normal healthy people, not us.  People with

IBD do 

lose blood regularly, even though it may not be visible.  If you need iron, 

your doctor should tell you, and it is quite common for us IBDers to need

it.  <BR>

He/She will be able to tell from your blood test results.  It's based on

your 

hemoglobin count and other counts that are usually taken all at the same

time 

with a routine CBC (complete blood count).  I'm no expert on this by any

means, 

but I know that I felt weak, lifeless, had no energy, couldn't concentrate

or 

remember simple things, and became very slow at my work when I had a very

low 

hemoglobin.  There was definately a problem, because I wasn't used to being

so 

&quot;empty headed&quot;, and slow, plus it's no fun to feel listless all

the time, it 

makes you depressed.  I took Floradix (I didn't know if it was allowable

or 

not, but I couldn't stand iron pills the doctor prescribed because they

were 

instantly constipating.  I couldn't stand to be constipated all the time,

so 

when my homeopath/naturopath told me to get the Floradix iron tonic which

is 

made from natural plant extracts and fruit juices, I went for it.  Since

I was 

in remission at the time (no symptoms other than anemia), I took the Floradix 

willingly.  I don't know if it helped or what, but my hemoglobin went from

73 

to 119 in two months time.  The normal is around 120 and up. (this is the 

Canadian measuring system).  I lost those &quot;zombie&quot; feelings, and

felt a lot 

better.  It could have been something else I took, like the multi-mineral 

pills, or I could have just gotten better spontaneously over time.  The 

floradix tasted good, like juice, so I liked to take it.  I stopped taking

it a 

while ago and haven't checked my blood lately.  Anyway, there's my two cents<BR>

<BR>

Hi All--<BR>

<BR>

John asked about &quot;invisible bleeding&quot; with UC...speaking only

for myself, I<BR>

        have Crohn's and am ALWAYS anemic. My GI doctor has told me I will probably 

        always have at least &quot;a slow leak,&quot; and that occult blood tests 

        on my stools will probably always be positive, even if I'm not in a major 

        flare or having visibly bloody stools. I would imagine that many others 

        with IBD are in this same boat. Depending on how my bowels are behaving, 

        my hematocrit blood test is always below normal, and sometimes VERY below 

        normal. I take a prescription iron capsule called niferex, which is the 

        only iron I've been<BR>

able to tolerate, taking either one or two a day (dependent on my last<BR>

hematocrit check), and still have never gotten a normal result.<BR>

<BR>

It is true that you should only supplement iron if you are anemic, so anyone<BR>

using it should have a blood count checked.  Unnecessary iron in the diet<BR>

will accumulate in your organs, especially the liver, and can cause<BR>

significant disease if it goes on too long.<BR>

<BR>

Good Health to all--<BR>

Julie <BR>

&gt; Elaine mentions, page 142, to take nothing that contains<BR>

&gt; sugar,starch,wheat,soy,whey, or yeast.<BR>

&gt; What if a vitamin does list various things that are not in it, like<BR>

&gt; above.  But does not mention not containing sugar.  I don't think I've<BR>

&gt; read whey either actually.<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt; Does that mean we should not take them?<BR></FONT>

<BR>

I would really avoid all pills with fillers that are on the prohibited list.  There<BR>

        are some companies (like Twin Lab) which produce good quality vitamins 

        with the potency they have promised and without harmful fillers. As I 

        had mentioned, I unfortunately have to make an exception for my synthroid 

        tablets because they are not available without lactose; but at least they 

        are tiny, and I've had no problems from taking them with a lactase tablet 

        (but be careful about what is those if you have to use them, also) in 

        spite of Elaine Gottschall's advice *not* to take lactose with lactase 

        to compensate for it.<BR>

<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">



&gt; Oh, also, do the Freeda vitamins list ALL of the items above on the bottle?<BR>

<BR>

        </FONT> Supposedly Freeda vitamins are excellent, with no starch and sugar, 

        and they would list all their ingredients of course, since they are a 

        reputable company. I have never tried them, as someone told me they were 

        mostly tablets, rather than capsules, which I feel are not absorbed as 

        easily (and people with gut problems have enough problems absorbing nutrients). 

        But since I've never even looked into them, perhaps my informant was wrong, 

        and they have capsules available, also.<BR>

<BR>

Hi Benjamin,<BR>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">

&gt; My doctor just gave me Eurethromyacin for a bronchitis. I currently have UC<BR>

&gt; and am in my fifth week of the SCD diet with minor overall improvement.<BR>

&gt; Before the SCD I also had bronchitis and when my antibiotic cycle was<BR>

&gt; finished I tanked real bad with the UC.<BR>

&gt; What I would like to know is what the antibiotic will do to the bacteria I<BR>

&gt; am supposed to helping and starving with the SCD diet?<BR>

<BR></FONT>

The antibiotic will unfortunately kill off the good bacteria in your gut, the<BR>

same bacteria you are working so hard to promote.<BR>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">

&gt; Are there supplements<BR>

&gt; I should take to help the good bacteria? And is there any way to avoid the<BR>

&gt; relapse when the cycle is done?<BR>

<BR></FONT>

You can take whatever probiotics you were (I hope) taking before (I take PB8 but<BR>

there are undoubtedly many good ones), and perhaps take a higher dose; you can<BR>

eat homemade yogurt, made with an excellent starter, every day; and of course,<BR>

stick religiously as always to the SCD.  I would also limit even legal sugars,<BR>

eliminating honey and eating only the less sweet fruits (berries, for instance,<BR>

rather than mangos or melons), to help eliminate whatever candida overgrowth is<BR>

promoted by the antibiotic.  In addition, taking as much Vitamin C as you can<BR>

tolerate, in addition to other nutrients to build up your immune system, will<BR>

help deal with the insult to your immune system caused by taking antibiotics.<BR>

<BR>

I would *never* advocate anyone treating bronchitis without drugs and without<BR>

input from their doctors, although I have had to do just that, myself.  I can't<BR>

tolerate any antibiotics, so unless death were the alternative to taking them, I<BR>

personally avoid all antibiotics.  I have successfully treated literally dozens<BR>

of cases of bronchitis (I had chronic bronchitis when I lived in a polluted area<BR>

of NJ) with extra Vitamin C, and now I also add extra colloidal silver.  I don't<BR>

even go to doctors on the (now much rarer) occasions I get bronchitis, because I<BR>

know they will immediately prescribe an antibiotic which I can't take.<BR>

<BR>

Although I certainly would never recommend anyone else following my example, it<BR>

can't hurt to build up your immune system with as much Vitamin C (small doses of<BR>

Ester C several times a day will probably be most easily tolerated) as you can<BR>

take without irritating your gut, and other nutrients which promote the health<BR>

of the immune system.  There are many books which list all sorts of supplements<BR>

which promote immune system health.  Also, keep in mind that eating any sugar<BR>

(even SCD legal sugar such as honey) literally zaps the immune system for hours<BR>

after ingestion, which is enough time to allow something like bronchitis to<BR>

start.  A diet which doesn't include sweets (other than moderate fruit intake)<BR>

is healthiest for the immune system.<BR>

I've purchased vitamins at Freeda Pharmacy as a walk in customer before<BR>

all their own vitamins under strict kosher supervision. There is no<BR>

dairy or additives whatsoever and they can be trusted.<BR>

<BR>

The staff is very smart about natural health and helpful. It is actually<BR>

a very small family run pharmacy still practicing some old fashioned art<BR>

Two years ago before I knew about SCD I started taking Shaklee Suppliments.<BR>

At that time I was dehydrated, had no energy at all, and was having 16BMs a<BR>

day.  Within a week of taking the suppliments and another product they sell,<BR>

my energy level increased dramatically.  It was because of their products that<BR>

I even had the strength to go to a Crohn's support group where I found out<BR>

about SCD.<BR>

<BR>

Here in Indiana ones resources for good quality suppliments and whole foods<BR>

are not in abundance.  I feel fortunate that we have Shaklee distributors in<BR>

our area.  So far, I have found no other source of SCD allowed suppliments<BR>

locally.<BR>

<BR>

Its been 8 months since I've started SCD.  This diet along with the help of<BR>

Shaklee suppliments has given me an energetic, happy, pain free life outside<BR>

<BR>

Shaklee is known the world over as the leader in the science of health and<BR>

nutrition, and brings unparalleled nutritional expertise to us. Dr. Shaklee,<BR>

the founder, formulated vitalized minerals years before the word vitamin even<BR>

appeared in the dictionary.  The stability and integrity of the company is<BR>

sound. Shaklee is the only nutritional supplement company to research, develop<BR>

and manufacture its own products.   Over $150 million has been spent on<BR>

research, and over 90 articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals<BR>

on Shaklee's research.  Their newest (and third) research facility has just<BR>

been completed on the grounds of Stanford University. Clinical testing with<BR>

human subjects, although costly, is routinely performed to offer the most<BR>

conclusive proof of the effectiveness of the products.  And a study on the NBC<BR>

Today Show rated Shaklee #1.  The study showed Shaklee vitamins to have the<BR>

best disintegration time, thereby allowing maximum absorption. If a vitamin<BR>

does not dissolve in water within 30 minutes, it is not utilized and<BR>

assimilated by the body. This in itself is an important factor to consider<BR>

given the poor assimilation of those with IBD. <BR>

<BR>

We are being very cautious to use only whole foods in their natural form in<BR>

the SCD,<BR>

we should also be certain to use natural whole food supplements.  Please be<BR>

sure to check into the manufacturing company of your vitamins and request<BR>

clinical studies.<BR>

Be an informed consumer and make your own best decisions.<BR>

<BR>

If you are interested in trying Shaklee supplements, there is a 100% money-<BR>

back guarantee.  If you cannot find a local Shaklee distributor, please feel<BR>

free to call Shaklee direct at 1-800-VITALEA and use my sponsor code #TA29767.<BR>

I offer this because you will not be able to order directly without one. As a<BR>

nutrition counselor and strong supporter of the SCD, I will be happy to offer<BR>

any nutritional support I can.  My success is attributed to Elaine in her<BR>

infinite wisdom, the SCD, my own discipline and Shaklee supplements!	Best of<BR>

health to you all!  <BR>

Interesting to hear of your success with the SCD and MS. Certainly is<BR>

L-Glutamine is an amino acid and is therefore acceptable with the SCD.<BR>

There is a good book on it that you might want to get: The Ultimate<BR>

Nutrient Glutamine by Shabert (an MD and RD) and Ehrlich. ISBN<BR>

0-89529-588-1. I got my copy from Amazon and after reading it, started<BR>

taking 9gms/day of L-Glutamine. It has helped my gut and energy.<BR>

<BR>

B12 is a common problem with us. Its absorption is rather complex,<BR>

needing an intrinsic factor from the stomach and absorption from the<BR>

ileum (end of small intestine). A common problem with Crohn's which<BR>

tends to affect the ileum, is problems with B12 absorption. Like you,<BR>

I'm on weekly B12 shots.<BR>

&gt;Nature's Sunshine product called UC3J....&quot;A formula designed to provide<BR>

&gt;nutrients the lower bowel needs to function properly. To absorb toxins,<BR>

&gt;reduce inflammation, promote healing, soothe the bowel, give bulk to the<BR>

&gt;stool and promote the growth of friendly colonic bacteria.&quot;<BR>

<BR></FONT>

A couple of people requested that I give more information on this product. I<BR>

purchase it from Nature's Sunshine, a very reputable and knowledgeable<BR>

company. I used to purchase them from someone, but I became a distributor so<BR>

I could buy right from the company at a lower price. I do not actively sell<BR>

the product, but it allows my family and myself to save a little money. My<BR>

mom has had good success with their products in dealing with Chrones/Colitis<BR>

and I have used them for years in dealing with my own autoimmune disorder,<BR>

Interstitial Cystitis (but that is another story).<BR>

<BR>

If you would like to purchase this or other of their many fine products you<BR>

can do a search on the web for &quot;Nature's Sunshine&quot;. You will find many<BR>

places (and hopefully one close to you) that sells their products. A<BR>

particularly good site which also explains all of the products and answers<BR>

many questions is <A HREF="http://www.HerbShop.com">www.HerbShop.com</A>.<BR>

<BR>

A quote from their site:<BR>

&quot;If you are seeking herbal knowledge and herbal products, we are happy to<BR>

point you to the resources, and to the products. You'll find a wealth of<BR>

information, and a great array of herbal and health products, right here at<BR>

www.HerbShop.com, and in our shops. You can order directly from us, or<BR>

become an NSP member through us, and then order Nature's Sunshine Products<BR>

from NSP Home Office at a terrific discount.&quot;<BR>

<BR>

Anyway, I really believe in Nature's Sunshine products and especially the<BR>

product UC3J that my mom has had great success with. She also faithfully<BR>

takes Chlorophyll, Garlic, and Digestive Enzymes. A natural therapy (most<BR>

important of all including SCD) has been a life saver for my mother. Email<BR>

me if you want to chat more about natural remedies. cbleigh@biztechinc.com<BR>

<BR>

Wishing everyone a healthy day.<BR>

Dear Anne,<BR>

At some point or another I've asked Elaine all 3 of these questions, and<BR>

here is basically what she had to say: <BR>

<BR>

&gt;3.  Three diet-related questions: a.  What about Lactose-free milk?<BR>

A small amount in coffee or tea is O.K. <BR>

<BR>

&gt;b.  What about fructose crystalline?<BR>

Not allowed because it isn't always 100% fructose, even when the label<BR>

says it is.  <BR>

<BR>

&gt;c.  Why not fruit pectin?<BR>

It isn't allowed because it is treated with starch.<BR>

<BR>

Best of luck to you.<BR>

 And what if you happen to NEED a laxative, like my child? 

 Constipation IS a symptom of intestinal disorders, although not the

 most common.  I worry that some things are not SCD allowable for

 reasons other than those outlined in BTVC.  The same type of

 discussion pertained to sorbitol.

<P>Still writing for my sister, but if she could write herself, I know

she'd have spoken up against aloe.  Her &quot;naturalist&quot; doctor (she was

trying to treat a flair up with natural medicine) or whatever you call

it was treating her with pure aloe in capsules, specifically because

it is supposed to be so healing, for intestinal problems etc.; he

thought it would heal the ulcerations.  Wrong.  It nearly killed her. 

Elaine told my mother on the phone that it literally, in that pure

form, rotted her intestines.  Coupled with a several other factors,

she landed in the hospital for 2 months and nearly died. Elaine was

VERY specific about aloe being avoided.  She was extremely nice to my

mother on the phone and spoke to her for a long time.  If anyone wants

the specifics about the aloe business, I think the best would be to

call her.  I just know it is very bad for folks with UC.

<P>My sister is now back on the diet, it having been mostly a falling off

it that caused her flair-up in the first place, and doing well. She's

dextrose when in fact they are using a combination of sugars. She ran<BR>

Subject: <B>Elaine on garlic, acidophilus, and other supplements, and on resistant

starches</B><BR>



<P>I wrote to Elaine with a few questions recently and told her that if she

didn't object I might post some of her answers to this list.  I left

room for one-sentence responses but got back a lot more.  She didn't

tell me not to post her responses, so here goes:

<P>1. Kyolic garlic, acidophilus, and other supplements - I asked if the

Kyolic is permitted.  I told Elaine that the manufacturer told me (over

the phone) that it has less than 1 gram per capsule of carbohydrate

content, which comes from vegetable protein, which in turn is derived

from golden peas, and that it also contains a little magnesium

stearate.  Elaine replied as follows:

<P>&quot;Garlic is a great food and should be part of everyone's diet.  However

in manufacturing any product, processes go on which only those who work

in the plant could see.  As for the magnesium stearate in Kyolic garlic,

that does not concern me - it's OK.  But when we start this business of

'1 gram of carbohydrate which comes from vegetable protein which in turn

is derived from golden peas' then I don't have a clue as to what the

compound of carbohydrate is.

<P>&quot;For those on the scd, do not use such a product during the period when

you are trying to determine if the diet is working for you.  When you

are secure in knowing things are working, then some of these nebulous

ingredients such as in Kyolic might be tried.

<P>&quot;As far as I know, Kyolic garlic, fish oil, piles and piles of

supplements, have never cured these intestinal disorders - only the

elimination of the wrong foods.  Why can't those on the diet give the

diet a chance without 'mucking' it up with things that are not in the

book.

<P>&quot;The only other addition I would feel good about is the probiotic

substances such as acidophilus.  I had a chapter for the book on

probiotics but because the New England Journal of Medicine had published

a series of articles which were extremely negative re acidophilus I left

it out.  Plus the fact that I had learned that it is not certain that

acidophilus is OK for Crohn's of the small intestine but it is great for

UC and possibly colon Crohn's.  In other words, there are many

unanswered questions about it but Dr. Haas used it for our daughter's

UC.... As for acidophilus being OK for irritable bowel syndrome [my

condition], I would give the diet a chance and see if works and then

slowly introduce the acidophilus.  I would get the milk-based form in

powder or capsules.&quot;

<P>2. Resistant starches - Awhile ago, someone on this list (I believe it

was Cecilia) said she'd read that if cooked vegetables are allowed to

cool, the starches can alter to form &quot;resistant starches&quot; that are

exceptionally hard to digest, and that it is therefore a bad idea to

idea to refrigerate and reheat vegetable leftovers.  Elaine's view on

this is as follows:

<P>&quot;I spent many hours reading papers on resistant starches about 15 years

ago and decided that the vegetables we use are OK even if we let them

cool and use them as leftovers.&quot;

<P>Hope some of you find this of interest.

<P>    Dear Angela,

   <P>    I am so sorry to hear that you have been given antibiotics. I 

started out as you with very mild UC that didn't even need drugs - it 

would always resolve itself fairly quickly.

   <P>    Last February I was given antibiotics and had the same experience as 

you. Within 3 days I was into a flare that just kept up. I ended up in 

bad shape and then finally on this diet.

   <P>    I have been lucky after going to 2 other GIs to finally find a very 

good one. He told me that antibiotics will aggravate this disease and to 

avoid them unless they were needed literally to save my life.

   <P>    I have suffered for the past several years with sinus infections 

that made me miserable. One thing that you can try is to take raw garlic 

and ginger tea. The garlic should be cut up fine, and then taken on a 

spoon, without chewing, and washed down with water. Take 1 clove this 

way, on an empty stomach, 4 times/day. Eat some fruit or yogurt 

afterward to prevent any burning sensation. To make ginger tea, peel and 

grate 1 or 2 tsp. fresh ginger, and steep (don't boil) in boiling water 

for at least 15 min. Add lemon juice and drink. Take 3 cups per day. 

This is what I've been doing since the summer and this year is the first 

year in a long time that I haven't had a sinus infection or strep 

throat. I start this garlic/ginger treatment at the first sign of a bug 

and keep it up until I feel fine. You will stink of garlic, but if you 

can put up with that for a few days, stay home from work, you may save 

yourself a lot of suffering with your UC.

   <P>    I have heard that if you go to a compounding pharmacy you can get 

pure tylenol powder without any starch or other prohibited ingredients. 

Explain why you want it to the phamacist and hopefully he/she will sell 

it to you.

   <P>    As for the fruit juice, you should be able to find bottled or frozen 

concentrated fruit juice with nothing added.

   <P>    Janice

   <P>   

   <P>    I have a mild form of ulcerative colitis (diagnosed this past 

October)

    <P>    A couple weeks ago my usual sinus/allergy or whatever problems 

escalated into sinusitis, so I went to the doctor.  I was prescribed 

antibiotics.  They are working, but very slowly.  About a week after 

starting the antibiotics, I began having a flare-up, which has not 

stopped.  Is this a usual sort of reaction to antibiotics?  I assume it 

is a reaction to the antibiotics because I can't think of anything else 

that changed.  Does anyone know of an SCD safe alternative for treating 

sinusitis?

    <P>    Also, all tylenol seems to contain cornstarch.  Is there any type of 

pain reliever that is SCD safe?  I have been avoiding taking any, but 

every now and then I just get so miserable I break down and take some.

    <P>    I have been checking ingredients and many things contain ascorbic 

acid or lactic acid.  Are these okay?  It is so hard to find canned 

fruit and juice that doesn't have a bunch of extra stuff in it. 

    <P>    I really appreciate the kind and wonderful advice I have seen on 

this list the couple weeks I have been on it.  The messages involving 

children with CD/UC have made me cry because I know how miserable I can 

get with just mild UC and I have a six-year-old son.  I am so grateful 

that I am the one with problems instead of him. 

    <P>    Thanks, Angela

<P>&gt; I thought garlic an onion powder were allowed if you can be absolutely sure<BR>

&gt; that it contains only pure garlic or onion and nothing forbidden?  Isn't this<BR>

<P>Garlic and onion powder are not allowed because starch is used to prevent

caking.  No spice mixtures are allowed for the same reason.  The starch does

not have to be listed on the label.

<P>Hello Claudette,

<P>concerning echinacea I believe that this is not the right thing for us

people with bowel symptoms. Echinacea strengthens the immune system which

migh result in even much more worse flare ups. I read in many articles that

people with a very strong immune systeme also have a bad auto immune

reaction. Take this into account.

 <BR>&gt;  <BR>

&gt; I just buy the jars of minced garlic and take it by the spoonful.  

<P>

Hi all!

 <BR>I actually took a class on garlic from a biochemist type a couple years

ago. I don't remember all the big words, but I do have the concepts

down. If garlic is cooked it loses its natural antiviral, antibacterial,

or antifungal effects. Garlic has two compounds in it that come together

when it is crushed or cut which combine to make hundreds of different

sulfur compounds which are the things that kill the virus, bacteria, and

fungi. Those same compounds are also the part that has the distinctive

odor. That is why a whole clove has little odor - because the compounds

are kept separate by the clove. But when you crush it, what an odor! So

deodorized garlic (kyolic) does not have the antiviral, antibacterial,

or antifungal properties anymore, because all those wonderful sulfur

compounds have been removed from it. You can actually culture bacteria

in a medium of kyolic garlic. 

<P>Garlic also has wonderful anti-cancer effects. Now to throw the monkey

wrench into the pot, I just recently read an abstact on some new

research that showed that cooked garlic (chopped and thrown on the heat)

loses its anticancer effects. However, the researcher found (he was

working with rats or mice) that if the garlic was crushed and left

standing for 15 minutes before cooking, then the cooked garlic did still

have its significant anticancer effects.

<P>This raises the question for me of whether the data saying that garlic

loses it antiviral, etc effects was done with garlic that was cooked

right away and if letting it stand crushed those 15 minutes before

cooking might maintain those properties. I will be writing to some of

the researchers to see if they would be willing to research these

questions. 

<P>But until we know more, if you want to take garlic for its cold and flu

properties, you probably should rely on raw, crushed garlic. 

<P>Now regarding <B>echinacea</B>. I have been told by my doctor who is very

knowledgable about herbs (and I have read in various sources) that if a

person has an active and significant inflammatory or autoimmune disorder

(like active Crohns or UC), that taking echinacea can be

contraindicated. Echinacea strengthens the immune system and if you need

a quieted immune system to control your illness, this can work against

that. If you need prednisone, imuran, or other such meds, or are

borderline under control, be careful with echinacea. A stronger immune

system is not always a blessing in these circumstances. If your symptoms

are under control, I wouldn't worry about it, but if not, be cautious.

<P>Sorry I don't have info any SCD-safe products. Hope this helps someone.

<P>Gail, RN

Subject: <B>VITAMINS</B> <BR>

<P>I just started on some completely pure vitamins which are definately

ok for SCD.  They are from TWIN LABS.  They do not make ANY tablets or

pills of any kind.  Their vitamins come in clear gelatin capsules or

you can get their top-of-the-line supplement, Maxi Life, without the

capsule to take in juice or water.  This is what I sent to my sister,

who is the one with SCD.  Their calcium is the best absorbed, pure

oyster shell. They also make a liquid one which is supposed to be

miraculous tho admittedly a bit nasty.

<P>I found them through the mother of a friend, who was diagnosed with

multiple myeloma 15 years ago and told she had 4 months to live -

tops.  She was not willing to accept that and began an intensive study

of vitamins and their uses - and is alive today.  She really knows her

stuff and I talked to her at length about my sister's needs before

buying. She has small vitamin business, tho less than before because

she's getting on in years.  Anyway, before she considered using and

selling their products years ago she spent TWO DAYS at the TWIN LABS

facility and saw every aspect of their production. She is COMPLETELY

satisfied they contain nothing other than the pure vitamins and

minerals.  <BR>As they feel that pills cannot deliver completely fresh

doses of vitamins, they do not, as I said, make any, so you can have

none of the things SCD folks shouldn't get, because there is no need

for fillers.  I would highly recommend these to anyone!  I found them

also in good natural medicine places.  <BR>In the Boston area you can get

them in HARNETS in Harvard Sq. on Brattle Street.  They have lots of

awesome things there!  <BR>They are also available on the web through

various sites.  Search for TWIN LABS vitamins and you'll find them. 

They are, of course, expensive, but well worth it.

<P>I learned when I called TwinLabs that MOST of their products contain potato

starch!!!   I was asking about several of their mineral products (Mn, Mo,

Ca, Mg, etc.!), Vit. E, etc. and their responses were yes, yes, yes ...all

of these contain potato starch.

<P>Really made me MAD at this company that has created an IMAGE of such a

forthright supplement supplier!

<P>Also, I had purchased a Selenium product from Solaray - the label said NO

added yeast, starch, etc.  And yet, when I got home and read the

ingredients, they listed RICE as the base.  I'm quickly concluding that you

can trust NO ONE!!
