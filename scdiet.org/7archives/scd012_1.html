I found this review of Elaine's first book while perusing some old
Townsend Newsletter magazines.  I thought it would be valuable to put here 
as a possible resource for people just learning about the
diet or who are looking for concise resources that could help explain it
to family and friends.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <I>Food and the Gut Reaction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; by Elaine Gottschall, B.A., M.Sc.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Kirkton Press<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; R.R.1 Kirkton, Ontario, Canada N0K, 519-229-6795<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1987 softcover, $16.95 + shipping, 143 pp.<BR><BR></I>

The title of this small book reflects the academic background of the
author, a research biochemist and nutritionist, working in Canada.
Although written primarily for those people who suffer from specific
digestive and intestinal disorders, she documents the results of her
years of research on diet-related illness, an area in which many
physicians could educate themselves, as well.<BR><BR>

The author clearly explains the role of microbes and intestinal flora in
the maintenance of a healthy digestive system, and how an imbalance
triggers an unhealthy milieu, leading to intestinal disorders.  The
author's research focused on the gut's reaction to different kinds of
diet, in the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
diverticulitis, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, and chronic diarrhea.
From this data a surprising diet emerged, showing the most optimal
results from the restriction of carbohydrates.<BR><BR>

The Specific Carbohydrate Diet is the centerpiece of this book, with
each segment of the diet explained in terms of how it works in the gut,
and the scientific rationale for including or excluding different foods.
Research has shown that the underlying problem in intestinal disorders
is the inability to digest carbohydrates due to microbial overgrowth and
toxins.  The process that results in illness is begun in the altered
milieu of the digestive system, a progressively more inflammatory
condition, leading to the inability to digest a major part of our
Western diet, with concomitant malabsorption and its resulting
nutritional deficiencies.<BR><BR>

Good explanations are given of the breakdown of foods by enzymes and
their role in the digestive process.  The author also explains the
different kinds of carbohydrates found in food and the few, such as
legumes, fruit, and yogurt, which are digestible by patients with
intestinal disorders.  Although celiac disease is explored in more depth
than some of the other digestive disorders, the general thesis is that
all of these (above named) intestinal disorders are simply earlier or
later stages of the same process.<BR><BR>

The Specific Carbohydrate Diet is highly nutritious, and by judicious
choice of foods, can be well-balanced.  The case histories cited often
speak of subjective improvement within days of beginning the diet, and
symptomology significantly improved within months.  Although no
large-scale studies have yet been done, patient populations in Canada
that were put on the diet were often cured completely after several
years.  The value of this dietary treatment is in the scientific work
done which is so completely ignored by the orthodox medical community.
I dare say a chunk of the pharmaceutical profits are generated by drug
treatments of these disorders, as well as keeping a large force of
specialists in the style to which they've become accustomed.<BR><BR>

This diet is not merely a listing of foods allowable and not allowable,
it is much more.  In just the discussion of allowable fruits, for
instance, distinctions are made between &quot;loose&quot; California dates (okay),
and dates which stick together in a mass, showing they have had syrup or
sugar added.  Nothing is overlooked;  one must be committed to improving
one's health to stay with this diet, but the outcome is worth it.  The
most restrictive part of the diet is of course, with grains;  no cereals
or flour, no potatoes, But once the gut is healthy again, these can be
re-introduced slowly.<BR><BR>

The purpose of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet is to deprive the
microbial worlds of the intestine of the food it needs to overpopulate,
the sugars from the carbohydrates.  By using a diet which contains
predominantly &quot;predigested&quot; carbohydrates, the individual with an
intestinal problem can be maximally nourished without overstimulation of
the intestinal microbial population.  The diet presents a method for
breaking the dysfunctional cycle by allowing only carbohydrates
requiring minimal digestive processes which are absorbed and leave
virtually none to be used for furthering microbial growth in the
intestine.  As the microbial population decreases due to lack of food
(while being balanced by lactobacilli), its harmful by-products also
decrease, freeing the intestinal surface of injurious substances.  No
longer needing protection, the mucus producing cells stop producing
excessive mucus, and carbohydrate digestion improved.<BR><BR>

Intestinal disorders are becoming endemic, and worse, the conventional
medical wisdom has little to offer.  Anyone with any of these disorders
would be prudent to give this diet serious attention.<BR><BR>

Subject: <B>SCD Cited in Wellness Book</B><BR><BR>

Hi Guys!<BR><BR>

I recently bought &quot;Digestive Wellness&quot; by Elizabeth Lipski, M.S., C.C.N.
 (has anyone read it?  if so, what did you think?)<BR><BR>

Under IBD she refers to the SCD:<BR><BR>

&quot;There is no one diet that helps all people with IBD, although the Elemental
Diet and Haas Specific Carbohydrate Diet work well for many people....The
Specific Carbohydrate Diet eliminates all simple sugars.  As discussed under
IBS, many people are unable to split disaccharide sugars (lactose, sucrose,
maltose, and isomaltose) into single molecule sugars.  This may explain, in
part, why the diet is so successful.  The Specific Carbohydrate Diet also
eliminates grains, which generally cause inflammation of the intestines in
people with IBD.  Leo Galland, MD, has found that the Specific Carbohydrate
Diet works well for people with IBD.&quot;<BR><BR>

Later on, she specifically references Elaine's book as a resource and lists
what is allowed on the diet.  Then she goes on to say &quot;This diet is
beneficial because it eliminates most foods that cause sensitivities--grains
and dairy products.  Similar to the candida diet, it helps restore intestinal
balance.&quot;
<BR><BR>
[I thought it was interesting that she cites it as dairy free, when it is
actually lactose free.]<BR><BR>

<P>Hi all:
<P>This was forwarded to me by a local CD sufferer who is recent to the diet.
He will be on the list when he gets time to breath - he was also at our
local SCD get together. <BR>
Mike Windrim
<P>Here's a very interesting article re: Elaine's books!!  They by no means
wholly endorse her but they certainly don't seem to simply dismiss it as
having no value.  I'll be seeing a new GI guy in about a month so I think
I'll take this article along from him to read.
Let me know what you think...... <BR>

<P><H2> The 'specific carbohydrate diet': Nutritional quackery or of possible
 benefit for some IBD patients?</H2>

<B>VIVIANE ALBERT MSc PDt, ILENE GILBERT DHec PDt, GORDON GREENBERG MD
 FRCPC, SEYMOUR MISHKIN MD FRCPC,ON BEHALF OF THE IBD NUTRITION REVIEW
 FORUM

<P> Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet, by Elaine
 Gottschall (1994). Kirkton Press, RR #1, Kirkton, Ontario N0K 1K0. 160
 pages; $16.95.

<P> Food and the Gut Reaction, by Elaine Gottschall (1987). Kirkton Press,
 RR #1, Kirkton, Ontario N0K 1K0. 143 pages; $16.95.
</B>

<P> The following critique of Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal
 Health Through Diet (and the author's earlier publication, Food and
 the Gut Reaction) is based on a review of both books, a meeting with
 the author when she spoke to our group on October 24, 1994 and
 feedback from patients who read the book and/or tried the 'specific
 carbohydrate diet'.

<P> Elaine Gottschall BA MSc, both in print and in real life, portrays the
 image of a dedicated, caring individual who believes with all her
 heart that the 'specific carbohydrate diet', if followed with
 &quot;fanatical adherence&quot; for a minimum of two years (&quot;at least one year
 after the last symptom has disappeared&quot;), will provide a cure for
 Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (page 52). (The reaction of a
 Forum member to this material, in particular this sentence, was &quot;this
 would appear to be a book on fundamentalism rather than
 gastrointestinal science (even pseudo-science). I think that the
 handling of this type of material calls for great, great care.&quot;)

<P> Although the specific carbohydrate diet does not meet the criteria of
 a chemically defined elemental regimen, the author equates the
 rationale and efficacy of her approach to that of the elemental diet
 whose efficacy in Crohn's disease is accepted with known limitations
 by the medical community. A recently published meta-analysis of
 enteral nutrition as a primary treatment of active Crohn's disease (1)
 indicated that corticosteroids are more effective than enteral
 nutrition. Furthermore, the study did not demonstrate an advantage to
 elemental feedings compared with a polymeric formulation.

<P> Once the patient is asymptomatic, presumably after following her diet
 for two to three years, one &quot;forbidden food&quot; at a time can be
 introduced weekly, progressing from small amounts initially. In the
 event of symptoms the specific carbohydrate diet should be resumed.
 The rationale for the specific carbohydrate diet is that &quot;predigested&quot;
 carbohydrates can easily be absorbed in a poorly functioning
 intestine. This, in turn, breaks the vicious cycle involving
 malabsorption of disaccharides, bacterial overgrowth and bowel injury
 (page 9).

<P> The origin of this approach dates back to an 1888 article, On the
 celiac affliction by Samuel Gee (2), in which he stated &quot;what the
 patient takes beyond his ability to digest does harm&quot;. The basic
 principle of the diet is that &quot;no food should be ingested that
 contains carbohydrates other than those found in fruits, honey,
 properly-prepared yoghurt, and those vegetables and nuts listed. By
 using a diet that contains predominantly 'predigested' carbohydrates,
 the individual with an intestinal problem can be maximally nourished
 without overstimulation of the intestinal microbial population.&quot; The
 essentials of the specific carbohydrate diet according to Elaine
 Gottschall follow.
 <BR> <BR>
<P> <B>PROTEIN</B>

<P> -Proteins are well tolerated and not restricted except for gluten
 (page 5).

<P> -&quot;Any cereal grain is strictly and absolutely forbidden, including
 corn, oats, wheat, rye, rice, millet, buckwheat or triticale in any
 form.&quot;
 <BR>
<P> <B>FAT</B>

<P> -Fat is handled moderately well (page 5). Some animal products are
 permitted.

<P> -&quot;Although grains are not permitted, salad and cooking oils made from
 grains may be used&quot; (ie, corn and soy bean oils); &quot;olive oil is highly
 recommended.&quot;
 <BR>
<P> <B>CARBOHYDRATE</B>

<P> -No sucrose - &quot;Do not use products made with refined sugar&quot; (page 58).

<P> -No starch from grains - &quot;any cereal grain is strictly and absolutely
 forbidden&quot; (page 49).

<P> -No starch from roots.

<P> -No lactose (no enzyme-treated milk, no acidophilus milk) (page 56).

<P> -Some allowable legumes; &quot;in general squash, tomato, string beans and
 carrots, all in cooked form are well tolerated (page 45) ... raw
 vegetables should not be introduced until diarrhea is under control
 (page 43) ... no canned vegetables permitted&quot; (page 53).

<P> -Honey to be used to sweeten foods (&quot;as much as desired ... when the
 diarrhea has cleared&quot;) (page 43).
 <BR>
<P> <B>FIBRE</B>

<P> -No cereal bran (page 49).

<P> -No raw fruits and no raw vegetables until diarrhea is under control
 (page 43).

<P> -No seeds for the first three months (page 59).

<P> -No allowable legumes for the first three months (page 52).

<P> -No commercial pectin (page 52).

<P> -Nuts must be ground until diarrhea has cleared up(page 55).
 <BR>
<P> <B>VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTATION</B>

<P> -Very large doses of added vitamins are unnecessary.

<P> -B complex vitamins may be taken as a supplement, especially for women
 on contraceptives (page 47).

<P> -Vitamin B12 levels to be up to high normal (page 47).

<P> -At least 100 mg of vitamin C/day to be taken.

<P> -Vitamin D in combination with vitamin A is recommended in northern
 climates during winter (page 47) - caution is advised against the use
 of vitamin D in the summer (page 49).
 <BR>
<P> <B>MINERAL SUPPLEMENTATION</B>

<P> -Mineral supplements to be taken if mineral levels are low (page 48).

<P> -The importance of maintaining proper calcium levels is stressed.
 <BR>
<P> <B>MISCELLANEOUS</B>

<P> -Soy products, including tofu, are not permitted.
 <BR> <BR>
<P> When asked about the differences between her books, Elaine Gottschall
 replied as follows. &quot;The revised edition of Food and the Gut Reaction,
 Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet, has four
 major differences.

<P> &quot;1. A four-page foreword by Ron Hoffman MD (graduate of Albert
 Einstein Medical College in New York City).

<P> &quot;2. A summary (page 7) of the chapter in the 1990 edition Inflammatory
 Bowel Disease entitled 'Dietary factors in the aetiology of
 inflammatory bowel disease' by Dr KW Heaton (3), which discusses
 results of 20 international studies on the eating patterns of people
 before the onset of inflammatory bowel disease.

<P> &quot;3. A new chapter on the 'brain connection'. I discuss epilepsy, etc,
 in this chapter based on many cases of children especially. As you may
 know the Ketogenic diet for epilepsy (Johns Hopkins) has been ignored
 by mainstream and has been the basis of the Charley Fund (Jim
 Abrahams, Hollywood writer whose child was cured by it). The
 researchers haven't a clue as to why ketone bodies reverse epilepsy. I
 suggest that because it is a mainly high fat diet, it is the
 elimination of carbohydrates/gut connection where they should be
 looking.

<P> &quot;4. About 12 new recipes with a fabulous sliceable bread recipe.&quot;
 <BR> <BR>
<P> It is of interest that Dr Ronald Hoffman who wrote the very flattering
 foreword proposes a somewhat different diet for inflammatory bowel
 disease (IBD) patients in his book (attributed to Dr Lamar Gibbons)
 Seven Weeks to a Settled Stomach (4). Honey  and sorbitol, which are
 not restricted by Elaine Gottschall except in very active disease, are
 on Dr Gibbon's &quot;vigorously avoid&quot; list. This point is made to indicate
 that apparently empiric and/or arbitrary differences exist between the
 popular diets offered as curative for IBD patients. Elaine Gottschall
 credits Drs Sidney and Merrill Haas, who introduced her to the
 specific carbohydrate diet that proved to be a cure for the &quot;incurable
 ulcerative colitis&quot; in her eight-year-old daughter who had not
 responded to treatment with sulphonamides or cortisone. Disappearance
 of gastrointestinal symptoms occurred after two years on this diet
 which was faithfully followed for seven years. Apparently the &quot;first
 symptoms to disappear were a type of seizures which occurred after she
 had fallen asleep. They were characterized by delirium, lasted about 1
 h and reoccurred several times weekly&quot; (page 38). In our collective
 experience we have not encountered ulcerative colitis patients with
 seizure symptoms similar to those experienced by the author's
 daughter. A symptom-free interval of more than 20 years is another
 unusual event in the course of IBD, diagnosed according to currently
 accepted criteria.

<P> According to Elaine Gottschall, relief has been observed in, in
 addition to IBD patients, &quot;celiac disease (not cured by a gluten-free
 diet), diverticulitis and various types of chronic diarrhea.... Some
 of the most dramatic and fastest recoveries have occurred in babies
 and young children with severe constipation and among children who,
 along with intestinal problems, had serious behavior problems. These
 included autistic-type hypoactivity as well as hyperactivity, often
 accompanied by severe and prolonged night terrors&quot; (pages 1-2). Claims
 regarding the efficacy of the specific carbohydrate diet in treating
 emotional problems associated both with gastrointestinal and
 nongastrointestinal disorders (ie, schizophrenia) are outlined in
 chapter 7 (&quot;The brain connection&quot;). Except for rapid improvement in
 mood in celiac patients once they adhere to a gluten-free diet, we are
 not aware of any evidence of &quot;psychoses from digestive origins&quot;.

<P> Our overall reaction to the book is that Elaine Gottschall's strengths
 are most evident when she is presenting the various aspects of the
 specific carbohydrate diet. Despite the restrictions imposed this diet
 is nutritionally balanced, palatable and varied. Nevertheless patients
 often lose weight while trying to adhere to this diet. The advice
 regarding vitamin and mineral supplements, especially calcium, is
 appropriate. Weaknesses become apparent when Elaine Gottschall
 attempts to tie together the myriad confusing medical and scientific
 literature. Her concern about possible hepatotoxic effects of lactose
 hydrolyzed milk (page 45) is unlikely to be a problem except in
 exceptionally rare cases of galactosemia. Her emphasis on the work of
 Jones, Hunter and other members of that Cambridge-based group is
 excessive. The claims made by this group in publications between 1985
 and 1993 (6-9) regarding the incidence of 'food allergies' and the
 major therapeutic efficacy of elimination diets following a remission
 induced by an elemental diet in Crohn's disease patients have been
 seriously questioned by subsequent controlled studies involving
 double-blind challenges (10,11).

<P> In her favour it must be admitted that there is some scientific
 evidence to support a limited nutritional agenda for IBD patients. For
 example in severe ulcerative colitis there is evidence that
 improvement can be achieved by severely restricting all starches and
 sugars (12). In addition, necrotizing enterocolitis, a severe type of
 gastroenteritis, is often observed in premature infants (in whom
 lactase enzyme levels have not yet reached maturity) who were fed
 lactose containing (whey-based) formulas (13). The unifying hypothesis
 proposed is that unabsorbed carbohydrate (ie, lactose) combines with
 casein or other proteins to form toxic compounds (14). A recent study
 showed that oligofructose and inulin, naturally occurring indigestible
 carbohydrates, promoted the growth of bifidobacteria in the human
 colon (15). The authors concluded that small changes in diet can alter
 the balance of colonic bacteria towards a potentially healthier
 microflora. We can only speculate whether the polysaccharides present
 in the legumes and nut flours permitted in the specific carbohydrate
 diet, rather than the avoidance of various sugars, may be responsible
 for the benefits claimed.

<P>  To Elaine Gottschall's credit she is prepared to tackle a murky field
  which many physicians and nutritionists prefer to avoid (page iii).
  She is attempting to provide a unifying and scientifically valid
  hypothesis for her diet. Appropriate warnings to continue under
  conventional medical supervision and therapy appear at the beginning
  of the book as well as in chapter 8 (page 46). She also indicates
  that the diet is unlikely to be helpful if no improvement is seen
  after a one-month trial (page 50). She also warns against the use of
  any foods known to cause allergic reactions. The feedback we received
  from a limited number of IBD patients indicates an appreciation for
  her style of writing and her attempt to explain certain aspects of
  IBD within the context of a unifying hypothesis, albeit incomplete.
  However, they envisage the diet as time-consuming, restrictive in
  terms of social interactions (ie, eating at restaurants and friends'
  homes) and expensive, but worth trying should all else fail. Another
  potential problem with restrictive diets is weight loss, an
  inappropriate risk for IBD patients especially if they are not
  benefiting from the diet. It should be noted that the drop-out rate
  from clinical studies involving long term elimination diets usually
  exceeds 33% and is especially high among adolescents (11). We welcome
  Elaine Gottschall's willingness to participate in an objective
  controlled study of her diet, which we believe to be essential.

<P> Clearly Elaine Gottschall is doing something right in the eyes of
 patients with IBD and/or other gastrointestinal problems. As of May
 1995 she has sold over 90,000 copies of Food and the Gut Reaction and
 Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet. A second
 printing of at least 12,000 copies of her latest book is planned.
 Interest shown by IBD patients (according to Canadian statistics there
 are approximately 250,000 Canadian IBD sufferers, 50% of whom have
 active disease) in these books is probably a reflection of the
 inability of conventional medicine to cure IBD and of the rising
 popularity of alternative or holistic approaches for the treatment of
 chronic illness. Whether the Gottschall diet adds to the therapeutic
 armamentarium of IBD management remains an area for proven scientific
 study.
 <BR>
<P> <B>CONCLUSIONS</B>

<P> We believe that the specific carbohydrate diet must be validated under
 controlled conditions before its use can be endorsed. We strongly
 advise that patients who undertake to follow this diet should do so
 under the supervision of their physicians and nutritionists. We urge
 our colleagues to familiarize themselves with the pros and cons of
 various nutritional approaches to IBD. This may help control the
 widespread use of untested popular diets and alternative forms of
 medicine (16). In the absence of a properly designed placebo
 controlled trial, it remains uncertain which subgroups of IBD would
 benefit from this diet and whether the response is superior to that
 achieved with conventional medical treatment or experimental drug
 trials.
