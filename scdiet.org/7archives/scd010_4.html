Apart from whatever gluten or starches may be in the cube, those things
are<BR>
usually made from a form of msg (it has many names...and is a close chemical<BR>
relative of aspartame or NutriPoison)...now commonly called an Excitotoxin.<BR>
I'd stay away from them if you value your eyesight, your nerves, and other<BR>
assorted body parts. <BR>

<BR>
Canola oil is not recommended by Elaine, use Olive oil or if you have<BR>
allergies, your probably amine salicylate sensitive, use soya oil but not<BR>
soybeans.<BR>
<BR>
Alfalfa, but no others, have the go ahead by Elaine, but Phil Alexander,<BR>
suggests to avoid them because of unseen mould which grows on them. For<BR>
allergy sufferers, he recommends that it's not worth it. I've even tried<BR>
growing them at home with little success, They always &quot;turn&quot; on
me and go<BR>
mouldy.<BR>
<BR>
A lab technician who sprouts legumes for the laboratory suggested bleaching<BR>
them first, but have not had success with this either.<BR>

Any seeds are OK as long as you are completely free of symptoms incuding<BR>
tiredness, aches and pains, sore feet, rashes, these non-specific symptoms,<BR>
indicate the presence of a leaky gut and a gut wall which is not<BR>
completely healed. The addition of nuts and seeds may bring back diarrhea<BR>
in many cases. As for myself I have just come off dairy, stopped all nuts<BR>
and changed my herbal medication and in less than a week my diarrhea and<BR>
bleeding have stopped, so which was it? who knows but something is<BR>
responsible for It's been pretty bad since October.<BR>

<B>Seeds / whole nuts</B><BR>
<BR>
Hi victor,<BR>
<BR>
Definitely do not take any seeds while there is any kind of<BR>
extensive inflamation unless you wish to tear a hole in your intestines.<BR>
The same goes for whole nuts. Don't trust you teeth to chew them. No matter<BR>
how well you chew them, teeth cannot crush nuts to a safe level of fineness<BR>
for IBD sufferers. Grind all nuts and preferably cook them at first. this<BR>
softens them and makes them more digestible. When you improve you may be<BR>
able to take some raw nut meal with yoghurt and honey, which is the ideal<BR>
way to have them since the enzymes are still active when raw. But while
the<BR>
bowel is inflamed, Mechanical considerations must take precedence over<BR>
optimal nutrition. UNHULLED tahini is a good source of calcium and is a<BR>
tasty treat over steamed vegetables.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards<BR>
<BR>

I just spoke to Elaine to make sure that the answer I thought to be<BR>
accurate, was. It is. Sesame is fibre. Similar to nuts, they should be<BR>
avoided when beginning the diet, but can be introduced when diahrea is no<BR>
longer an issue.<BR>

The answer about seeds is that Yes they are allowed eventually, but not right<BR>
away.  In the book it says something to the effect of - no seeds of any kind<BR>
until several months after all symptoms are gone.  This is not an exact quote,<BR>
but I don't have the book with me.  You can try seeds if your diarrhea is gone.<BR>
 Just try a few and then see what happens.  If you have problems, then<BR>
discontinue for a few more months.  So seeds are one of those foods for later<BR>
on in the diet.  I assume that ground seeds such as tahini (made from sesame<BR>
seeds) would be easier to digest than whole seeds.  This is just my theory,<BR>
with no basis on fact. <BR>

Subject: <B>psyllium seed</B><BR><BR>

Hello listers,<BR><BR>

Elaine's book says, somewhere, no seeds, period.  Yet Michael, at various places
on Mik's web site, recommends two different seeds: psyllium seed, and sesame
seed (the latter in the form of sesame seed paste, or tahini).  I think psyllium
would be a great addition to the diet, which is pretty low fiber compared to a
carb diet, but have been hesitant to use it due to Elaine's instructions.  What
do you think: OK or not?  And, some products separate seed from husk, i.e., you
can buy huskless, only husks, or a mixture.  Any opinions, or better,
experience?

For awhile I was using psyllium seeds during a phase of constipation.
They really helped a lot.  I took a 1/4 tsp. twice a day.  Any more than
that irritated my intestines.  It's probably a highly individual thing
to figure out.  By the way, I know what you mean about reading that
Elaine says no seeds but I'm also sure I've read her say that psyllium
and slippery elm are okay to use.<BR><BR>

 <BR>
When Elaine spoke in Tucson in 1995 she said psyllium was ok to use for<BR>
those that wanted to. It's a mucilaginous seed and it is an intestinal<BR>
lubricant.<BR>
<BR>
And, some products separate seed from husk, i.e., you<BR>
&gt;can buy huskless, only husks, or a mixture. Any opinions, or better,<BR>
&gt;experience?<BR>
<BR>
My experience with this rag is that the powdered psyllium seed husks are<BR>
the way to go for best cleansing. And for IBD the powder is better. The<BR>
'course' husks and seeds have little particles of husks in them.<BR>

Yvonne,<BR>
About the rosehip powder; I would save it for later when your symptoms are much 
improved.  Too much vitamin C can cause diarrhea and anything acidic can 
irritate our guts as well.  As for it being allowed or not on the SCD, I 
believe it should be OK as it is like an herb or flower and I don't think it 
has starch.  A little rosehip tea is probably ok, but watch how much acidy 
things you are taking in because they can be irritating.  These are just my 
opinions.<BR>

&gt;fruits like pineapples, watermelons etc.  I want to purchase<BR>

<BR>
Dried fruits are allowed if they have no added sugar, etc. , so making them<BR>
yourself would be fine.  However, some people do not tolerate them very
well. <BR>
When I tried raisins for example, I got diarreah right away, so now I don't
eat<BR>
them.  I had a dehydrator but found it too cumbersome and time consuming
to<BR>
make dried fruit.  You have to clean, peel, and slice everything thin; lay
them<BR>
all out and then wait 1-3 days, periodically checking, and rotating the
trays<BR>
for even drying.  The infomercial makes it look fun and easy.  I bought
mine on<BR>
the shopping channel and was ultimately disappointed, so I gave it away
to a<BR>
friend, who hasn't used it yet either.  It sat in my cupboard for a year
or so.<BR>
 If you think yogurt is a hassle to make, dried fruit is a lot more work.
 I<BR>
don't want to sound totally negative about it though, so if you can tolerate<BR>
it, Go For it.  It's a good idea for those people who have the time and
are<BR>
ambitious. <BR>

<B>Dried Fruit</B><BR>
Wed, 23 Apr 1997 18:47:30 GMT<BR>
Hi all,<BR>
<BR>
I just had a major experience with trying to eat some dried dates<BR>
recently.  I ate a bite of one and didn't get any reaction, so I ate at<BR>
least five.  I have been off of most fruit but have had better luck, for<BR>
some reason with tropical fruit, so decided to give dates a try.  Well,<BR>
I didn't have any bloating or my usual gut reactions, but I later<BR>
started itching in tiny spots all over my body, mainly on my face and<BR>
behind my ears and also troubling anal itching.  There was no red rash,<BR>
just itching.  And I had a lot of trouble sleeping, which was like 8<BR>
hours later.  I felt intensely wired, in a way beyond what could be<BR>
described as a &quot;sugar high.&quot;  For the next two days, I felt ravenously<BR>
hungry for protein.  I also felt jittery after drinking black tea, which<BR>
never bothers me, I felt like my adrenals were way out of kilter.  <BR>
<BR>
A friend of mine asked me if maybe they were sulfered dates and maybe I<BR>
had an allergic reaction.  They don't say sulfered or not, so I am not<BR>
sure.  But this was one of the weirdest reactions to a fruit type food<BR>
I've ever had.  Now, four days later, I am mostly returned to normal.  I<BR>
limited all the foods I usually eat to limit any gut reactions that<BR>
might be happening.  Now I just have a little itching left.  Has this<BR>
ever happened to anyone else with dates?  Does anyone know what might<BR>
have happened?  I'm trying to get some perspective on what could have<BR>
happened.  Is there any info out there on the effect of sulfered dried<BR>
fruit for people on the scd?<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
This definitely sounds like a candida problem. candida can get out of hand<BR>
if your immune system is low. If you feed it it's favourite food - sugar,<BR>
then you will activate its metabolism very much. Candida produces<BR>
formaldehyde as a by-product of its metabolism. The results are many and<BR>
varied, but the most common are headache, spacey/dizzy/foggy thinking, and<BR>
rashes and ecsma. the toxins from the candida lodge themselves in various<BR>
parts of the body and if you are in the advanced mycelial stage, the fungus<BR>
itself may be in various parts of the body tissue.<BR>
<BR>
Treatment - Diet Low in Sugar and high in complex carbgohydrate. This is<BR>
hard on the SCD and you may find you have to abandon the scd to get the<BR>
Candida under control. as has been my case. Without the sugars of the SCD,<BR>
it's too hard to get enough calories. Candida sufferers cannot take any<BR>
dried fruit, and only 2 pieces of fresh fruti a day. You could keep the<BR>
basis of the SCD and add WELL COOKED grains taken only as a porridge. Stick<BR>
to gluten free grains - rice millet and arrowroot and cook them in double<BR>
the amount of water for 45mins to 1 hr. boil or pressure cook till you get<BR>
a thickened porridge consistency. This is how you should introduce grains<BR>
if you are comming off the scd as well. start with smaller quantities and<BR>
build up gradually over a week or two so as to give the pancreas a chance<BR>
to adapt to the greater workload.<BR>
<BR>

Subject: <B>Re: Food dehydrator</B><BR>
<P>Hi Michelle,
<P>
&gt; I have a hard time believing too much fruit can be bad for a person,<BR>
&gt; since it is purely natural and would be one of the main sources of the<BR>
&gt; caveman diet?  He does eat a lot of nuts with the fruit, and then he has<BR>
&gt; full meals three times a day as well.<BR>
<P>Let's take these issues one at a time.
<P>Yes, too much fruit can be bad for a person, as an overload of fruit in
proportion to other elements in the diet means the diner is having too much
sugar, which is detrimental to health.
<P>Yes, fruit is pretty much purely natural (although manipulated genetically
from the natural state for qualities that make it easy to sell, store and
ship).  But hemlock is natural, as are mushrooms, some of which can kill
almost instantly.  There are many natural substances (plants, herbs, fungi,
etc.) which are actually poisonous.
<P>Fruit was not one of the *main* sources of the caveman diet, at least not in
the kind of quantities we are talking about here.  Plus the fruit of that
day was quite different from the fruit we have available now.  It was much
less sweet, and much more fibrous.  Plus, as a percentage of calories, I
wouldn't call fruit a main source.  It was an important source, but meat and
fish were major, with fruits, greens, nuts, and tubers all playing a very
important role.
<P>Plus, you have to consider that a quart of dried fruit is equivalent to a
quantity of fresh fruit that we probably can't even begin to visualize.
Dried fruit is not something that would ever have been a source of calories
for a caveman; it's an extremely *concentrated* sugar.
<P>
&gt; Anyway, hubby is 6'5&quot; and believe me, he needs to eat a LOT!  And he<BR>
&gt; loves all the things he cannot have; for him, fruit is the best<BR>
&gt; alternative.  Perhaps things will change but for now, it's all we can<BR>
&gt; do.<BR>

<P>I'm sure a man who is 6'5&quot; and has (still, no doubt) absorption problems
does need an incredible amount of food.  If and when he can tolerate the nut
flour, I think he would be better off having more calories from meat, fish,
nut flour, veggies and as a last and least source, fruit.  Your husband
actually would be *much* less hungry (and a good deal healthier) if he ate
less fruit.
<P>&gt; As for candida, he has never had a problem with it, to our knowledge...<BR>

<P>It might be worthwhile to check it out (with Great Smokies Lab) and make
sure he doesn't.

<P>&gt; Has Elaine said anything about honey or fruit consumption being limited?<BR>

<P>Elaine is trying to help as many people as possible to get off the treadmill
of drugs, hospitalizations, surgery, and ill health.  She understands that
Crohn's patients, in particular, do crave sweet things.  She has recommended
that people balance their diets, for instance, by not eating more than four
(if I remember correctly) small muffins per day, and eating (once they can
tolerate all foods, of course) meat, fish, cheese, yogurt, muffins, veggies
and fruits in a balanced diet.  I doubt Elaine would have ever envisioned
someone eating a quart container of dried fruit a day, so the issue has not
come up in the book.  Elaine only mentioned limiting honey in cases of
candida, in which she said that the honey in the recipes should be cut down.
Her field of expertise really is in intestinal health and how to promote it,
not specifically in treating candida overgrowths.  In severe cases of
candida overgrowth such as many people who have had as many antibiotics and
as much prednisone as many of us who have UC and CD have had, it actually is
not possible to recover while ingesting honey and fruit, even in limited
quantities.  It probably would be possible if one had a mild case.
<P>In any case, your husband is certainly much better off eating inordinate
quantities of dried fruits than he would be if he were eating Twinkies :-).
Maybe once he has adjusted to forgoing the forbidden things he once loved,
he will think about balancing his diet so he can not only recover fully from
Crohn's but become as healthy as it is possible for him to be :-).
<P>Take care,
<P>Deborah

&gt;cannot be healed due to a high fruit consumption, (sugar) well, this<BR>
&gt;concerns me, of course, as the &quot;caregiver.&quot;  I'd like to know how much<BR>
&gt;fruit and honey people on this list are consuming each day.  Let's talk<BR>
&gt;more about this, please!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Michelle<BR>
&gt;CD<BR>

<P>Michelle,
<P>I eat almost no honey, but I eat about 4 bananas a day and usually 1/2
grapefruit or an apple. This may sound like a lot of fruit, but dried fruit
is MUCH more concentrated.
<P>I found some info in &quot;The Complete Athlete&quot;, by John Winterdyk PhD, Karen
Jensen ND:
<P>&quot;If you eat an excess of simple carbohydrates you don't need to worry about
excess fat but you may want to consider the effects this diet has on your
general health. An overreliance on simple carbohydrates can cause overloads
in blood glucose and possibly a deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine). This
overload can also tax the adrenal glands and pancreas, causing them to work
overtime in an effort to normalize your blood sugar level...Ultimately this
type of diet can lead to diabetes and adrenal exhaustion.&quot;
<P>As you eat foods containing simple sugars, the body uses only those it needs
and deposits the rest as fats and cholesterol. The deposits can be in the
liver, heart, arteries, kidneys and muscles, and can result in conditions
such as obesity, rheumatic disease, diabetes, tumors, liver and kidney
diseases, and atherosclerosis. These fat deposits also reduce the oxygen
level in the tissures thus slowing down your body's metabolism. This, in
turn, causes fats to accumulate faster. When this happens all your exercise
will seem to get you nowhere.&quot;
<P>Janice

Geesh, just when you think you know it all. I called Elaine &amp; checked about<BR>
the watermelon. It is fine. We agreed that I must have  had a problem with<BR>
it way back when (my memory was better in those days), and Elaine advised<BR>
me to not eat it. For me it is obviously a problem food. If it isn't for<BR>
you, enjoy. After all this time, I may give it another shot myself (I'll<BR>
keep you posted).<BR>
Elaine wants me to send her regards and also to tell you about a mistake<BR>
she may have made. A woman who has her child on the diet asked about any<BR>
possible fast food. She told the woman that in an emergency (outing,<BR>
birthday party, ect), it would probably be OK to just eat the meat out of a<BR>
macdonald's hamburger. When she relayed the story to her daughter, her<BR>
daughter reminded her that most fast food resteraunts use filler in their<BR>
burgers. Elaine says she knows about additions to cans, but never thought<BR>
about this application. She wants me to pass it on.<BR>
Again, my apoligies for the watermelon misinformation.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Tomato Paste</B><BR></FONT>
Sat, 21 Jun 1997 13:46:10 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Someone asked about tomato paste. While I can't speak about the 
acceptability of tomatoes on the SCD diet, I can talk about food chemicals.<BR>
One of the laws (at least in the US) is that manufacturers do not need to 
list ingredients of ingredients. Tomato paste does not have a &quot;standard
of 
identity&quot; (a regulations specifying how something will be made) so
if 
listed as an ingredient, the ingredients of it can contain anything they 
want to put into it! This will mean that invariably it will contain 
HVP/MSG, which is often made from a gluten grain (or soy if not gluten).<BR>
<BR>
When buying tomato paste straight, you will find some that are pure tomato 
paste (generally no salt ones) and you will find ones with natural flavors 
or natural flavorings. These are legal euphemisms for HVP/MSG.\.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Soy protein</B><BR></FONT>
Wed, 7 May 1997 0:24:09 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Everyone,<BR>
I'm the one that said soy protein should be allowed. This is because it
is<BR>
only certain carbohydrates we need to avoid, not protein. The reason soy<BR>
milk is not allowed is because it still contains carbohydrates. I mean we<BR>
are allowed to eat yogurt as long as we ferment it long enough to get rid
of<BR>
disaccharides even though the milk proteins are still present, so why<BR>
shouldn't we be able to eat soy if it's only the protein component of it?<BR>
Also, I read the information in the book about soy protein intolerance,
and<BR>
it doesn't say that people with IBD have this problem, it only says that
in<BR>
some instances there are similar symptoms.<BR>
But anyway, it is a personal choice to eat it or not. I cannot find tuna<BR>
without soy protein (and some other products as well) that doesn't cost
more<BR>
than double the one containing soy protein. And it happens to be a big part<BR>
of my diet so I don't want to give it up. I just want to let other people<BR>
know who are having this problem that eating the soy protein has not caused<BR>
me any problems.<BR>
Also, someone mentioned that laxative properties of coffee in response to
a<BR>
question about decafe coffee. But isn't it the caffeine that causes this?<BR>
<BR>
Hope everyone is well.<BR>
Take care,<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Hi,<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;my name is Miroslav and I live in Germany. I have got a copy of
the<BR>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Specific Carbohydrate Diet&quot; and studied the recipies.
For some of the<BR>
&gt;&gt;breads &quot;baking soda&quot; as opposed to &quot;baking powder&quot;
is required and I<BR>
&gt;&gt;don`t know what &quot;baking soda&quot; is as it is translated in
the dictionary<BR>
&gt;&gt;the same way as &quot;baking powder&quot;. I would be grateful if
anyone helped me<BR>
&gt;&gt;explaining what &quot;baking soda&quot; is.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Sincerely<BR>
&gt;&gt;Miroslav<BR>
<BR></FONT></TT>
<BR>
Hi there Miroslav,<BR>
<BR>
Baking Soda is different to baking powder.<BR>
<BR>
Baking Soda is Sodium Bicarbonate alone.<BR>
<BR>
Baking Powder is a mixture of 1 part Sodium Bicarbonate and 2 parts Cream
 of Tartar. You can mix up your own and avoid harmful additives and starches
that are also added to make it free-running. mix together and store in an
airtight glass jar.<BR>

Hi there,<BR>
<BR>
Lecithin is made from soy, so its strictly not on the diet. If you want<BR>
real peanut butter that is not rancid and requires no stabilisers or<BR>
additives like lecithin, go to your healthfood shop. Most of them will<BR>
grind peanuts or other nuts into butter on the spot at the consistency you<BR>
prefer.<BR>

<B>Salt</B><BR>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1">
&gt;There was a comment recently that iodized salt could be a bad thing.
Does<BR>
&gt;anyone have any more information on this? - I use it sometimes, assuming
it<BR>
&gt;would help with any deficiencies.<BR></FONT></TT>
<BR>
Hi Anne,<BR>
That was me. I used to use table salt until I found it was just as devoid
of natural balance as white flour and whit sugar. White salt, has been refined
and had all its trace minerals removed. These minerals are then srecovered
and sold to the chemical industry or pharmaceutical companies for use in
dietary supplements. Biodynamic salt is available and would be better than
common salt, but it too has been processed somewhat. Celtic Salt from france
is available that has been harvested in the traditional method to provide
a balance of minerals that is very healing internally and externally (as
a poultice).<BR>
<BR>
hope you can find some. <BR>

<BR>
I hope gelatin is allowed (I think it's used in some recipes in the book).
I have been using it quite regularly. I mix it up with about 1 TBS of honey
and 2 cups of fresh fruit juice that's been heated in the microwave just
enough to dissolve the gelatin. Yummy!<BR>

<B>Cayenne</B><BR>
<BR>
Cayenne has been touted as a good herb for UC it will not do much by<BR>
itself, and is best taken adjuctively. It's action is to increase mucous<BR>
production in the bowel. supposedly protecting it from damage. In my<BR>
experience, this is not such a good thing. Stimulating an already upside<BR>
down immune system through irritation is not a good theory in my books.<BR>
Also cayenne is very high ion salycilates, a naturally occuring pesticide,<BR>
but a handful for the liver nevertheless. I have found Slippery elm and<BR>
Psyllium to be much more effective provided they are taken between meals<BR>
with plenty of water. They then act as a kind of 'artificial' mucous that<BR>
helps the stools through quickly and they themselves absorb toxins.<BR>

 Fri,  9 May 1997 22:37:40 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Before I was on the diet I ate everything I wanted as this is what my<BR>
doctor told me.  Incidentally he does not believe in the diet.  This means<BR>
that I also drank occasionally.  One night (my birthday) I was dared to<BR>
drink a prairie fire, well being the stupid piehead I'am I did it.  For<BR>
those of you who don't know what a prairie fire is it is a shot of tequila<BR>
(sp?) with a lot of cayenne sauce, sounds yummy doesn't it?  Well let me<BR>
just say that was undoutably the dummest thing I have done in all my life.
<BR>
The next day was hell as well as the next two months.  My weight at the<BR>
time of the dare was about 115 lbs, about a month later it was at 79 lbs,<BR>
no kidding.  I was hospilalized and put on TPN for ten days.  I  was<BR>
released and at home I bounced back to normal.  Bounced meaning it took<BR>
about four months.  The moral of the story is don't eat those dammed<BR>
cayeene pills or any hot sauce.<BR>
