<B>Anti-inflammatory Potential of Essential Fatty Acids</B><BR>
Sun, 4 May 1997 20:16:02 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Dear group,<BR>
<BR>
I recently, quite by accident, made a discovery that I want to tell you<BR>
all about.<BR>
<BR>
Tired of eating so many almonds, I began to eat pecans. In fact, I was<BR>
eating quite a bit of them. It soon dawned on me that when I did, I<BR>
began to experience tremendous energy bursts. So I started to look<BR>
into what the cause might be. It led me to consider the possibility<BR>
that pecans had higher levels of Omega-3 oils than almonds (they do). I<BR>
considered this because I remembered how good I felt while in Mexico<BR>
eating large quantities of fish (fish also has high levels of Omega-3<BR>
oils. While I was in Mexico, my skin (I suffer from acne and eczema)<BR>
healed dramatically. <BR>
<BR>
I started to do some reading and discovered a lot of information about<BR>
how omega-3 oils (found in fish oil, flaxseed oil, and a variety of<BR>
other oils like soybean and walnut in lessor concentrations) are highly<BR>
implicated for having anti-inflammatory effects (and in general, tend to<BR>
be missing from our modern diets).<BR>
<BR>
I began to take fish-oil supplements and immediately and dramatically,<BR>
(like, the next day) began to have the best bowel movements I've ever<BR>
experienced in my life. Solid, formed and coiled. Previously, my more<BR>
normal stool were still sticky and often &quot;ribbon-like.&quot; My energy<BR>
remains high and my skin has become smoother. I was amazed to notice my<BR>
skin was actually healing within one day. Usually if I get an acne<BR>
breakout, it stays with me for weeks. The breakouts I had now healed<BR>
within two days. The eczema goes away completely. It comes back if I<BR>
miss taking the fish-oil (or flaxseed oil, which I am also trying out to<BR>
see which one works better for me). Also, I just had a mentrual period<BR>
and didn't have any of the fatigue I usually have, which I believe is<BR>
due to the increase of beneficial prostaglandins from the oil.<BR>
<BR>
I felt compelled to share my experience with the list, even though I am<BR>
still in the &quot;we will see&quot; phase of excitement about it. I hardly
get<BR>
my hopes up about anything until I've my results are conclusive over a<BR>
long period of time. I am enclosing some info I found and typed in, so<BR>
you can read some of the research I've found on this subject. If anyone<BR>
else has had experience with using omega-3 oils or wants to communicate<BR>
with me about it, I would be greatly open to it.<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>

From &quot;<B>Omega-3 Oils,</B>&quot; by Donald Rudin, MD and Clara Felix,
page 67.<BR>
<BR>
In one study, doctors in Bologna and Turin, Italy, gave fish-oil<BR>
capsules three times a day for one year to thirty-nine Crohn's patients<BR>
who had been in remission for about eight months. A similar control<BR>
group of thirty-nine patients received capsules that contained neutral<BR>
oils. The fish-oil capsules were specially formulated to reduce fishy<BR>
odor and to improve absorption of Omega-3 EPA and DHA. Reducing the<BR>
odor was important, because until the trial was over, neither the<BR>
doctors nor the patients knew which patients had gotten which oils. <BR>
After a year of ingesting 2.7 grams of EPA and DHA every day,<BR>
twenty-three of the patients who received the fish oils were still in<BR>
remission. By contrast, only eleven of the thirty-nine control patients<BR>
stayed in remission.<BR>
<BR>
In Crohn's disease, bowel tissue contains abnormally high levels of<BR>
inflammation-producing, &quot;bad&quot; prostaglandins from Omega-6 ARA.
In the<BR>
patients taking the shish oil whose illness remained in remission, red<BR>
blood cell levels of ARA plunged, while levels of Omega-3 EPA and DHA<BR>
rose greatly. In general, laboratory tests indicated that inflammation<BR>
decreased in the fish oil patients, but increased in the control<BR>
patients.<BR>
<BR>
Ulcerative Colitis is another chronic inflammatory disease, usually of<BR>
the large intestine, in which ulceration and erosion of the bowel tissue<BR>
cause severe diarrhea and loss of blood, as well as weakness and weight<BR>
loss. As in Crohn's disease, bowel tissue shows high levels of &quot;bad,&quot;<BR>
ARA-produced prostaglandins. The worse the symptoms, the higher the<BR>
levels of these trouble-making prostaglandins. In one study, conducted<BR>
by William Stenson of Washington University School of medicine, twenty<BR>
four patients with active ulcerative colitis who took fish-oil capsules<BR>
for four months showed a big drop in &quot;bad&quot; prostalandins. These<BR>
patients also showed bowel tissue healing and reduced rectal bleeding,<BR>
and they gained badly needed weighcapsulescapusles contained 5.4 grams<BR>
of EPA and DHA. Moreover, seven patients who were also getting<BR>
prednisteroid steriod drug, were able to cut their dosages in half.<BR>

<B>New Study Finds Fish Oil Helpful in Crohn's Disease </B><BR>
<BR>
A fascinating report appearing in the June 13, 1996 issue of the New<BR>
England Journal of Medicine found fish oil preparation to be useful in<BR>
Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is a condition characterized by<BR>
recurrent episodes of inflammation of the intestine. This disease may<BR>
be serious, and at times patients may require surgery to remove those<BR>
parts of the intestine most severely inflamed. Typically Crohn's disease<BR>
is episodic. This means that patients may experience &quot;flare-ups&quot;
during<BR>
which time their disease is active, as well as relatively symptom free<BR>
periods during which time digestive function is fairly normal. <BR>
<BR>
This recent study looked at 78 patients with Crohn's disease. One group<BR>
received nine fish oil capsules each day or a placebo. Among the group<BR>
of patients receiving the fish oil, 28% had relapses during the one year<BR>
study. In contrast, in the group receiving the placebo, 69% experienced<BR>
relapses. <BR>
<BR>
It has long been known that foods like fish oil, rich in the omega-3<BR>
essential fatty acids, have significant anti-inflammatory activity. The<BR>
omega-3 essential fatty acids produce a specific type of chemical in the<BR>
body called prostaglandins, which serve as one of the body's main<BR>
mediators of inflammation. <BR>
<BR>
The richest plant source of omega-3 essential fatty acids is flaxseed<BR>
oil. Flaxseed oil has long been recommended in a variety of inflammatory<BR>
conditions including those of the intestine, arthritis, various skin<BR>
conditions, and even brain inflammatory problems like multiple<BR>
sclerosis. Many patients taking flaxseed oil have noted improved nail<BR>
strength, reduced cravings for fatty foods, and improved texture of skin<BR>
and hair. The typical adult dosage is 1 tablespoon of cold pressed fresh<BR>
flaxseed oil each day.<BR>

<B>EFA FUNCTIONS IN BODY--</B><BR>
<BR>
--1.EFAs are precursors of several important regulatory molecules such<BR>
as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes in the body.<BR>
Prostaglandin E1, in particular has a wide range of desirable effects<BR>
including reduction of inflammation, lowering blood pressure and<BR>
inhibiting platelet aggregation.--<BR>
<BR>
--1.EFAs are involved in transportation and metabolism of cholesterol.<BR>
EFAs disperses cholesterol and makes it more soluble so that the body is<BR>
able to get rid of it. EFAs also have the ability to inhibit the<BR>
synthesis of LDL the bad cholesterol in our body.--<BR>
<BR>
--1.EFAs are required for every single cell in the body to function<BR>
effectively. The cell membrane must compose of certain level of EFAs for<BR>
proper cell structure and integrity.--<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<B>Fish Oil--</B><BR>
Fish Oil is the oil extracted from the flesh of cold water fish. These<BR>
are fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines, herrings and<BR>
anchovies. Fish oil is a rich source of the omega-3 essential fatty<BR>
acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid<BR>
(DHA). Both EPA and DHA are normal constituents of some human tissues,<BR>
including brain cells, retina, adrenals and sex organs - all the most<BR>
active tissues in the human body. They also help keep the arteries<BR>
clean. Fish oil has been shown in studies to lower serum triglyceride<BR>
levels and reduce the thrombotic tendency of blood by reducing platelet<BR>
stickiness. Recent studies have also shown that in psoriasis, fish oil<BR>
significantly improves this skin condition. Fish Oil should not be<BR>
confused with cod liver oil which is the oil extracted from the liver of<BR>
the fish. Cod liver oil is a rich source of fatty acids and contains<BR>
significant levels of vitamins A and D. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Nervous System--</B><BR>
EFAs are required for the normal membrane structure, cell structure of<BR>
the nerves and for normal nerve functions. EFAs are also of major<BR>
importance in the central nervous system. Reduced amount of EFAs in the<BR>
red blood cell wall makes the blood cell rigid. This in turn results in<BR>
a reduction in the supply of oxygen and nutrients that can be<BR>
transported by the red blood cell to the nerves. The reduced volume of<BR>
oxygen and nutrients would impair nerve functions. Studies have shown<BR>
that GLA is able to prevent or reverse neuropathy (damage to the<BR>
nerves) because direct supply of GLA results in an improvement in nerve<BR>
blood flow. It is interesting to note that lipids make up 20 % of the<BR>
brain and is important for eye function.<BR>

<B>Re: Anti-inflammatory Potential of Essential Fatty Acids</B><BR>
 Wed,  7 May 1997 21:11:36 GMT<BR><BR>

Dear Denise and the group,<P>

In Denmark, a scientific research has kind of "proved" to us Danes that Omega-3
oils have an anti-inflammatory effect. I once put excerpts of an article which
stated this (in Danish) on the URL <A HREF="http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/dk4.html">
http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/dk4.html</A>
<BR><BR>
The article says that among 78 Danish Crohn's patients, half were given 2,7
grams of omega-3 oils, while the other half got "empty" pills containing corn
oil (placebo).<BR>
After one year, 59 percent among the first group had improved significantly,
while only 26 percent in the other group had. In all areas, the patients who
received omega-3 oils showed reduced imflammation.
<BR><BR>
I've eaten 2 grams a day for about three months - and even though I can't
exactly say that I feel it, I do believe that it helps, along with the diet. At
the moment, I have no imflammation at all.
<BR><BR>
Yours,<BR>
Mik

 Thu,  8 May 1997  9:38:17 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Dear Mik and group.<BR>
<BR>
Hi from Ireland, <BR>
I have a particular interest in Omega oils as I use them in the <BR>
treatment of an inflammatory kidney disease, which my sons <BR>
Age 13 and 16 and I have, its called IgA Nephropathy (IgAN)<BR>
along with Celiac Disease (CD) and Dermatitis Herpetiformes (DH) <BR>
 IgAN is a Circulating Immune-Complex Mediated Disease. <BR>
Also known as a Type of  hypersensitivity or allergy.<BR>
<BR>
I thought you and others on the list might be interested in some of<BR>
the information I have collected, it is importance to get the balance<BR>
of Omega-3 to Omega-6 right if you are going to take it to reduce <BR>
inflammation.. <BR>
This information might make you think twice about using to much<BR>
Omega-6 in your diet. Research into disease, shows that a higher<BR>
serum level of Omega-6 fatty acids may in fact be very bad for you.<BR>
<BR>
Omega-3 ( n-3 ) Not Omega-6 ( n-6 )<BR>
Is now being used in the treatment of Inflammatory Disease, Heart <BR>
Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis,  Ulcerative Colitis, <BR>
IgA Nephropathy ( kidney disease ), Epilepsy and Behcet's Disease <BR>
and Others with some success, research is still ongoing.  <BR>
Studies in progress include a larger, long-term studty in lupus nephritis
<BR>
and dosing studies in diabetic nephropathy and hemodialysis.<BR>
<BR>
There are 2 main Essential Fatty Acids (EFA's):<BR>
Omega-6 and Omega-3.<BR>
These EFA's cannot be interconverted.<BR>
That is, Omega-6 cannot be made into Omega-3 <BR>
And Omega-3 cannot be made into Omega-6. <BR>
Therefore we need both Omega-3 and Omega-6 EFAs in our diet. <BR>
<BR>
 Omega-3 and Omega-6 oils are two essential fatty acids that<BR>
together: --form the membrane of every one of the billions of cells in<BR>
our bodies; --control the way cholesterol works in our system; --make<BR>
up a very large part of the brain's active tissue; --are the only fats<BR>
that become prostaglandins which play key roles in regulating the<BR>
cardiovascular, immune, digestive, and reproductive functions;<BR>
inflammation and healing; functioning of the brain; and body heat and<BR>
calorie burning (weight loss).<BR>
 (This information is from the Canadian Grain Commission Crop Bulletin<BR>
No. 182, ISSN 0836, and The Flax Council of Canada:)<BR>
<BR>
LNA Deficiency: <BR>
Some of the problems of deficiency are:<BR>
Growth retardation, Weakness, Fatigue, Impaired vision, learning ability
<BR>
Motor incoordination,Tingling sensations in arms and legs and<BR>
Behavioral changes. <BR>
Symptoms that respond remarkably well to LNA supplementation <BR>
High triglycerides (fat) in the blood, High blood pressure, Sticky<BR>
platelets, Tissue inflammation, Edema, Dry skin, Mental <BR>
deterioration, Low metabolic rate and some kinds of immune <BR>
dysfunction.<BR>
<BR>
All Hydrogenated products should be stopped, while using EFA. <BR>
<BR>
No other oil is needed as the body makes all the other's <BR>
ie Lauric and Oleic etc from the Omega 3 and 6 oils.<BR>
<BR>
It is only in the last 20 years, that we have come to understand that<BR>
dietary EFAs are so important to our health.. Researchers now believe<BR>
that the increasing rates of Heart Disease, Alcoholism, Depression,<BR>
Hypertension, ( to name but a few ) seen in America and Europe<BR>
over the last 100 years, may, in part, be due to a significant shift in<BR>
the ratio of:<BR>
Omega-6 (arachidonic acid, linoleic acid)  fatty acids <BR>
TO<BR>
Omega-3(docosahexaenoic acid, linolenic acid) fatty acids in our diet.<BR>
<BR>
Other names.<BR>
1)  Omega-3 fat is also known as alpha-linolenic acid or n-3.<BR>
The Omega-3 fatty acids are:  <BR>
Linolenic, eicosapentaenoic - EPA <BR>
Docosahexaenoic acids - DHA<BR>
<BR>
2)  Omega-6 fat is also known as alpha- linoleic acid or n-6<BR>
( Linoleic acid (LA)  is the major essential fatty acid.)<BR>
The body converts  linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid: GLA.<BR>
<BR>
The human race evolved on a diet having a ratio of about 1:1 <BR>
of these acids. <BR>
The ratio of Omega 6 ( linoleic acid ) to Omega 3 (alpha-linolenic<BR>
acid ) is now between 10:1 and  25:1. The recommended level is  5:1.<BR>
<BR>
People who are treating an inflammatory disease with EFA's<BR>
Acording to research, should take a much higher dose of <BR>
Omega-3 to Omega-6.<BR>
A ratio of perhaps 5:1 infavour of Omega 3.<BR>
<BR>
We are taking 12 grams of Omega-3 a day in the treatment of our <BR>
kidney disease, some other's are taking up to 18 grams in the <BR>
treatment of their inflammatory problems.  This should not be <BR>
undertaken without a doctors approvel.<BR>
<BR>
Researchers speculate that coronary heart disease is strongly<BR>
associated with a low intake of Omega-3 fatty acids.<BR>
They discovered that men with coronary heart disease<BR>
tended to have a higher serum level of Omega-6 fatty acids. <BR>
<BR>
Omega-6 (Linoleic acid )is the major PUFA in most seed, <BR>
vegetable oils and sunflower oil.<BR>
This is converted to Arachidonic Acid within our body.<BR>
Borage oil is a source high in polyunsaturated fatty acids<BR>
 (PUFA) .ie. Omega-6. So is evening primrose oil. <BR>
Borage oil is particularly rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). <BR>
It also has 25% more GLA than evening primrose oil.<BR>
<BR>
It is not difficult to maintain a diet high in Omega-6 fatty acids.<BR>
Some experts consider that we have a diet which is already to high.<BR>
Omega-6 linoleic acid  is in vegetable seed oils (safflower oil, sunflower<BR>
oil, corn oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, almond oil, and olive oil), and<BR>
commercial spreads which are labeled polyunsaturated. I don't think we<BR>
have to be concerned about a lack of n-6 in our diet.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, Omega-3 supplementation has  been implicated <BR>
in the lowering of lipid levels and a reduction in atherosclerotic<BR>
vascular events in man. Fish oil, and its principal constituents,<BR>
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) possess<BR>
both anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties. These<BR>
omega-3 fatty acids inhibit inflammatory prostaglandin and leukotriene<BR>
production by displacing the arachidonic acid  ( found in Omega-6 )<BR>
substrate from cell membranes and compete with the arachidonic acid<BR>
for cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes. This competition results<BR>
in a shift towards the production of non-inflammatory series-3<BR>
prostaglandins and series-5 leukotrienes. Which lowers inflammation,<BR>
throughout the body including, in our case the Kidneys. It seems to me<BR>
that a diet high in Omega-3 and low in Omega-6 is perhaps the right<BR>
approach.<BR>
<BR>
2. Food sources of omega-3 FA include canola and soybean oils,<BR>
flaxseed, fatty fish (such as herring, mackerel, salmon and trout),<BR>
fish oils and fish oil concentrates, flaxseed, provide an alternative<BR>
dietary source of omega-3<BR>
<BR>
Being highly unsaturated, omega-3 fatty acids are susceptible to<BR>
peroxidation but adequate vitamin E intake might prevent oxidative<BR>
changes. Food sources of vitamin E are, vegetable oils and almonds. In<BR>
other words a small amount of Omega-6<BR>
<BR>
If one were to take flaxseed ( which has the richest natural source of<BR>
lignans) in place of Fish Oils one would not have to worry about the<BR>
Vit E, as Lignans are  believed to posess anti-oxidative properties<BR>
and would thus inhibit lipid peroxidation as well as retard<BR>
oxidation-induced inflammatory responses.<BR>
On the issue of fishoils V flaxoil, in terms of the serum levels <BR>
of the beneficial ingredients.<BR>
It apparently matters little which you take to attain these<BR>
levels. For instance one can take flax seed oil but the dose required<BR>
to attain the same seerum levels is about three times that of fish<BR>
oil. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
 Bits of the information, I have, which may be of interest.<BR>
<BR>
   Health News Naturally is copyright1996 by Keats Publishing, Inc.<BR>
    Osteoporosis affects both men and women. Although we normally<BR>
    think of osteoporosis as a women's disease, one in four hip fractures<BR>
   occur in men. The following thus applies to both men and women.<BR>
   Dietary calcium has one of two fates. Either it is absorbed into<BR>
   the bloodstream for potential utilization by bone, or it is<BR>
   excreted in feces. Fecal excretion of dietary calcium runs a wide<BR>
   range from 20 to 80 percent of ingested calcium. Obviously, the<BR>
   more calcium that moves out of the GI tract into the blood-stream,<BR>
   the more beneficial the effect. When calcium is absorbed into the<BR>
   blood it again has one of two fates. Either it is deposited in<BR>
   bone, or it is excreted by kidneys and urination. Here, both<BR>
   Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids help prevent osteoporosis each in a<BR>
   different way.<BR>
<BR>
   Omega-6 fatty acids (GLA) seem to improve calcium absorption from<BR>
   the gastrointestinal tract. This is the first important step in<BR>
   ensuring strong bones. Calcium needs to be absorbed from dietary<BR>
   calcium in the GI tract into the bloodstream for it to be<BR>
   accessible in building strong bones. On the other hand, arachidonic<BR>
   acid (AA), an essential fatty acid derived only from meat and dairy<BR>
   fats, speeds up urinary calcium excretion. Omega-3 EFAs, mainly<BR>
   from fish oils, are antagonistic to arachidonic acid and<BR>
   metabolites made from arachidonic acid. It is therefore no surprise<BR>
   that the Omega-3 EFAs prevent calcium excretion, thus insuring<BR>
   strong bones.<BR>
<BR>
<B>    Flax or Fish oil in the diet promotes health</B><BR>
   ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA. A high intake of fish oils, notably<BR>
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is beneficial in the fight against<BR>
   heart disease, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and<BR>
   ulcerative colitis. Now researchers at the Royal Adelaide Hospital<BR>
   have discovered that the blood and cell membrane content of EPA can<BR>
   be markedly increased by consuming a diet high in alpha- linolenic<BR>
   acid ( Omega-3 ) and low in linoleic acid ( Omega-6 )<BR>
<BR>
 <B>  Fatty acids influence immune system</B><BR>
   COPENHAGEN, DENMARK. It is generally accepted that a low-fat diet<BR>
   which is low in saturated fats and high in polyunsaturated fats is<BR>
   healthy and lowers the risk of heart disease. Now researchers at<BR>
   the University of Copenhagen Warn that certain polyunsaturated<BR>
   fatty acids (PUFAs) (Omega 6 ) may have a detrimental effect on the<BR>
   immune  system especially among older people. The researchers<BR>
   concluded that a diet high  in omega- 6 PUFAs, especially linoleic<BR>
   acid, impair immune system function. <BR>
  They found no detrimental effects of omega-3 fatty acids<BR>
   such as alpha-linolenic acid (found in flax oil). The researchers<BR>
   speculate that prostaglandin E2, which is produced from omega-6<BR>
   PUFAs, is the link between the decreased immune function response<BR>
   and dietary fat type. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vol.<BR>

   Omega-3 fatty acids help protect against heart disease <BR>
  SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. Researchers at the Veterans Affairs<BR>
   Medical Center report that docosapentaenoic acid and<BR>
   docosahexaenoic acid (a main component of fish oil) provide<BR>
   significant protection against the development of coronary heart<BR>

<BR>
Dealing with stress in a positive way has everything to do with the<BR>
protein/fat connection. Our life energy flows within this union. As we<BR>
go into stressful situations, our need for balanced protein/EFA<BR>
nutrients increase. And to metabolize them, our need for the other<BR>
essential nutrients increases also. In our busy, fast moving society,<BR>
stress comes from many directions. Our bodies are uniquely designed to<BR>
deal with large amounts of stress, and normally maintains a reservoir<BR>
of potential energy for such times. In dealing with prolonged, high<BR>
stress situations, however, sometimes that reserve of energy runs out.<BR>
During such times, we may look in all the wrong places to find answers<BR>
for our inability to cope and should be looking inside ourselves<BR>
rather than outside ourselves for answers. It just never occurs to us<BR>
that the symptoms may be caused by an internal chemical imbalance. As<BR>
I stated at the beginning of this page, most of us already get plenty<BR>
of protein. But we do have a great need to get our requirement of<BR>
essential fatty acids. There practical ways of obtaining and using <BR>
those EFAs we must have.<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I too have eaten Omega-3 oils and whithin one week felt a definite<BR>
improvement. I think they work. Another side affect seems to be that<BR>
they releive me of most of the pain I experience with bm's (when they're<BR>
almost normal), because of 50 percent og my colon is stiff - due to<BR>
extensive scarring of the wall.<BR>
<BR>
BTW - Mik, thanks for all the info you you give out. I found both the<BR>

paper.<BR>

<B>Omega 3 oil</B><BR>
Not all fatty acids are bad for the body. In fact, there are at least two
essential fatty acids that the body needs all the time and cannot manufacture.
They are: Alpha-linoleic Acid, LNA, known as Omega 3 oil, and Linoleic Acid, LA,
known as Omega 6 oil.<BR>
These fatty acids are needed for the manufacture of cell membranes, hormones and
nerve coverings in the body. Although other fats that enter the body are used for
their energy content, Omega 3 and Omega 6 are saved and only used for the
manufacture of hormones and in the structure of all of the membranes inside and
covering the cell. In treatment of the diseases that are produced by the damage
to the nerve covering, the regular intake of these essential fatty acids is a
must.<BR>

<BR>
hi <BR>
<BR>
the fish oil studies (the randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover) <BR>
that have i read have reported D in about 10% of patients, but the effective dose<BR>
is much much higher than the twice daily discusssed below. the range i have<BR>
seen reported as theraputic is about 4.5 grams of EPA (12-18 capsules daily)<BR>
the brand most used in studies has been either MAX-EPA or an enterically coated<BR>
capsule (not avaiable yet). i have also read where a woman having negative reaction<BR>
to predisone was given  i.v. EPA and it allowed her to rapidly wean herself from<BR>
the steriod, and in her case the oral EPA did not work, so the stuff does not<BR>
work in all cases, and some people have D, but some do get relief.<BR>
<BR>
so if you are looking for a benefit in fish oil 1000mg twice daily seems<BR>
too little to have any positive effect. i myself have used EPA to combat<BR>
severe consitpation, which is my particular IBD problem, i know i<BR>
have taken enough when the stool floats, which for me is about 10 1000mg<BR>
capsules a day. after i lost my excess weight (low carb diet)<BR>
i no longer need  the fish oil on a daily basis, but i still use it<BR>
occasionally.<BR>
