No one has ever been &quot;cured&quot; of celiac disease. I repeat no one. Because of
her absurd claim that it can be cured, she gets no respect at all in the
celiac community. But on a *strict* gluten-free diet, which her book does
not get into in enough detail, one can get a 100% remission. Nothing else
need be given up.<BR><BR>

If someone thinks that they have cured celiac disease, either they never
had it in the first place, or they still have it, but don't have visible
symptoms. Since it is defined as damaged mucosa, no other symptoms need be
present.<BR><BR>

If Elaine can document someone that is biopsy diagnosed, and now, for what
ever reason, can eat gluten and have a undamaged mucosa, proven by biospsy,
then this person should be written up in the medical journals.<BR><BR>

Hello Don!<BR><BR>

You sounded a little bit angry with me. I know only a little about celiac
disease. But I thought that Elaine had done her homework before putting her
words into her book. (I could have checked it out, but life is very short...
as John Lennon sang.) I have heard a lecture from a norwegian female doctor
saying precisly the same thing as you.<BR><BR>

If Elaine is wrong you should certainly start a discussion about it on the
list and not only with me private. It shold not be against the law to state:
Elaine is wrong! Because there is no God. Maybe you both are right. I seem
to remember that Elaine also states that all gluten must be avoided...<BR><BR>

<BR>
Hello SCD group, I'm new here in the group and have really been enjoying
reading all the entries. Thanks Mik for the yogurt, raisin, coconut, and
chopped nuts breakfast idea. Really tasty and quick to make.
<BR>
Having recently read the &quot;Purpose of the SCD Group,&quot; the one thing I find a
bit puzzling is the omission of celiac disease from the conditions for
which the diet is indicated. Dr. Haas documented curing over 600 cases of
celiac disease with the SCD in his book The Management of Celiac Disease.
Elaine Gottschall's recent article <A HREF="scdceli1.html">&quot;Whatever happened to the cure for
coeliac disease?,&quot;</A> recently published in the British periodical Nutritional
Therapy Today, is well worth reading for anyone with celiac disease who is
confused about whether it is necessary to go on the SCD or just go &quot;gluten
free.&quot; This article is posted on Mik's site. 
<BR>Also posted on his site is a
copy of an <A HREF="scdtheo.html">interesting letter from Dr. Theo Colborn to Dr. Peter Green
about her family's experiece with celiac disease and the SCD</A>. 
<BR>
Elaine's
article would be interesting reading for anyone on the diet, not just
celiacs, because it goes over the history of the diet from Dr. Haas on
back.
<BR><BR>
I've been following the diet for 4 years now. I had been battling
ulcerative colitis for over 15 years before I stumbled across the diet on a
Canadian TV show. I was at that time planning on having my colon removed. I
was steadily losing the little bit of bowel control I had up to that point.
The way I best describe my experience with the diet is that having regained
my health once again beats having won a 100 million dollar lottery. I feel
just that lucky, or luckier!

Maybe because we celiacs have our own mailing list with more than 2,000
subscribers. And as we have been discussing this diet is more restrictive
than is recommended by 100% of the doctors studying celiac disease. It is
hard enough to get people to give up gluten, and harder to get them to give
up more.<BR><BR>

Personally I follow close to a Paleolithic diet, which is close to the SCD,
but also eliminates dairy. Besides not being a food during the Paleolithic
era, part of the casein protein is very similar to gliadin, the toxic part
of gluten. Note that in many disorders, e.g. ADD, autism. depression,
schizophrenia both must be given up. Also in fibromyalgia many also have to
give up both. But here we are talking about immune system reactions to
proteins. Elaine focuses on sugars and starches.<BR><BR>

Dairy is well known for creating excess mucus and aggrevating asthma. This
alone gives me enough reason to give it up.<BR><BR>

I have not read his book. If he can show that they can go back to eating
gluten and have a normal biopsy then they should be written up in the
medical journals. If he hasn't done so I have to ask why? Or is this a
semantic issue and he's using the word cure to mean control.

Some celiacs also have other food intolerances. A common one is soy. Also

1951!!! The fact that gluten was behind the disease was only known for a
few years at that time. And yes, in the early days they saw the symptoms go
away and did think the kids were cured. But with the later invention of the
Crosby biopsy capsule, they learned that despite no visible symptoms,
damaged mucosa can be found in any celiac of any age that is not on a
gluten-free diet.<BR><BR>

If this were true, there must be in the 46 years intervening something
published confirming this early observation.<BR><BR>

(...)<BR><BR>
[The celiac article] is an important article although I doubt if many of
the proponents of the gluten-free diet will believe it. Those poor
people went around suffering for years with doctor after doctor telling
them there was nothing wrong with them and it was in their heads.<BR>
Finally, some doctor tells them it is celiac and they are so grateful
that they &quot;aren't crazy&quot; that they carry a special kind of loyalty to
anything he has told them to do. But the history I have written is
accurate and is the way it happened and as the article says, hundreds of
people are still suffering.<BR>
In fact the diet most celiacs have been told to ingest contains scads of
gluten - corn for example. The SCD is absolutely free of gluten and
gluten-like proteins although its foundation does not make a lot of
gluten but of the starch.<BR>
As my chapter &quot;Beyond Gluten&quot; shows, the gluten prevents the starch from
being broken down and absorbed thereby giving an over-abundance of
carbohydrate to the yeast and bacteria in the colon.<BR><BR>

&gt;merely allergic to gluten.</FONT><BR><BR>

Well, that is the current definition of celiac disease, except we *never*
use the word allergy, but a food intolerance. One book publisher had to
reprint 5,000 cookbook jackets once, because whoever wrote the front flap
article used the word allergy. (Bette Hagman's first cookbook.)<BR><BR>

One of the problems is the diagnostic criteria is strict. The medical
profession does put a lot of effort into not giving the diagnosis. They'd
rather miss a few then diagnosis one with it by mistake. Then most won't
diagnosis until the case is severe. Then there are some doctors that refuse
to give the diagnosis, as they feel the gluten-free diet is so bad the
patient is better off living with the symptoms.<BR><BR>

I feel a trial diet should be diagnostic, but the medical profession
disagrees. One problem is people then aren't sure whether they really have
celiac disease, and they can stray from the diet. The diet must be strict
and for life to protect against malignancies.<BR><BR>

And then there is the problem that a celiac diagnosis is unprofitable. Much
more money can be made with an IBS diagnosis.<BR><BR>

&gt;Dear all, The following is letter sent by Theo Colborn PH.D. to Dr Peter<BR>
&gt;Green of Columbia Presbyterian Med Center in NYC.<BR><BR>

&gt;All four of my children were born with Celiac disease. At age 2 &amp; 1/2 the<BR>
&gt;oldest was extremely ill even though he'd been placed on a gluten free diet<BR>
&gt;by a pediatrician who had diagnosed his problem as celiac disease.<BR></FONT>
<BR>
In those days a diagnosis was made by sniffing the stools. Biopsies didn't
exist yet. It is possible that they didn't have celiac disease, but
something like Crohn's or UC, or carbohydrate intolerance.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Today, my children (age 37 to 47) have no overt celiac<BR>
&gt;symptoms<BR></FONT>
<BR>
Many celiacs show no overt symptoms. Doesn't mean a thing. My brother was
diagnosed as an infant, gluten-free for six months, then &quot;cured.&quot; He is
now
46 and has no overt symptoms. He is 5'11&quot; and 130 lbs with osteoporosis
starting to set in. He did finally go to a doctor, who agree with him that
since there were no overt symptoms he didn't have it and didn't give him a
test. But at some age the symptoms will become more evident, and the bone
damage will be permanent.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;The gluten-free diet was useless. And except<BR>
&gt;for continuing to eat potatoes and rice (in order to sate my appetite) I<BR>
&gt;ended up on the Haas diet. This was not adequate and about 2 years ago my<BR>
&gt;health deteriorated so much, I thought I might have to retire. Because of<BR>
&gt;flatulance, diarrhea, and severe vaginitis and cystitis it was impossible<BR>
&gt;for me to work around others, travel, and eat outside my home. In addition,<BR>
&gt;I had wasted to 100 lbs and was fatigued, had trouble consentrating and was<BR>
&gt;in constant pain<BR><BR></FONT>

My guess is she also had carbohydrate intolerance, which is a more severe
disorder than celiac disease. It comes up on the celiac list about once a
year. Today most people with those symptoms pick up one of the books on
Candida and self-diagnose themselves with that. If there really is such a
thing (in people without AIDS) , then it would be a secondary condition to
gluten intolerance, where the Candida is flourishing due to the immune
system weakened by the toxic gluten. Her constant pain could also be what
is now called fibromyalgia. Some people can control it with a GF diet. More
need to go gluten and casein-free. For some that isn't enough, and very
possibly the SCD would give them relief. People with a FMS diagnosis do
have IBS, and they consider it part of the disease. On the FMS list many
are trying The Zone diet and finding it helps them. It is low in grains.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;I am taking the time to write this because I am truly concerned about all<BR>
&gt;the children with celiac disease who are chronically ill.. They do not have<BR>
&gt;to be chronically ill. I have attended several local celiac society<BR>
&gt;meetings and watched the chldren. These children will never be able to<BR>
&gt;reach their fullest potential while on a gluen free diet.<BR><BR></FONT>

This is news to me. I am not aware of any celiac children that are
chronically ill. She needs to do better than this to convince someone that
knows hundreds of celiacs.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt; The good news is<BR>
&gt;that it only takes about 3 years on a restricted carbohydrate diet to<BR>
&gt;restore the childrens health so that they are sympton free and remain that<BR>
&gt;way,<BR><BR></FONT>

It is well known that overt symptoms disappear during the adolescent
despite eating gluten. Mine did. But they was evidence of always having it,
e.g. skinniest in class, difficulty passing swim tests, ADD, puking when
drinking beer, teeth developing late, smelly flatulence, constipation, etc.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;I plead with you to try this simple approach to controlling and reversing<BR>
&gt;celiac disease.<BR><BR></FONT>

Actually I think I'll ask Dr. Green what he thinks of this letter. I have
his phone number around here, and know who to ask for his e-mail address.<BR><BR>

&gt; In the end I decided I must--- because I cannot stop<BR>
&gt;thinking about all those children at the celiac meetings with their<BR>
&gt;strained faces and miserable dispositions.<BR><BR></FONT>

As I wrote already this is news to me. I've read every article posted to
the celiac list for 2.5 years and for children 100% talk about their
remarkable recovery. Those with refractory sprue, where the GF diet doesn't
work, are older and often have been on and off the GF diet.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;On the other hand, I can no longer count the number<BR>
&gt;of people whom I have convinced to try this diet and who have had their<BR>
&gt;health restored, including women with diagnosed Crohn's disease who had no<BR>
&gt;hope of ever regaining their health.<BR><BR></FONT>

Right. No one is arguing that the SCD isn't needed for people with IBDs,
just she hasn't presented any evidence that it's needed for someone that
only has celiac disease, or that it &quot;cures&quot; celiac disease so people
can go
back to eating gluten again.<BR><BR>

I'm new to this list but feel that I've known Don for quite awhile through
the crohns colitis newsgroup.  I think you misconstrue his motives.  Don is
very knowledgable--particularly with regard to celiacs disease--and I am glad
that he provides his insights on these issues.  I thought his comments on the
letter were straightforward and fair minded.  He wasn't slamming the SCD, he
was merely correcting errors-in-fact in this woman's letter so that others
would not misunderstand celiacs disease. I don't feel his corrections
diminish her testimonial as to how much this diet has helped her and her
family.  It merely adds some information for those who might misunderstand.
 In fact, in his comments Don says this about the SCD.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&quot;No one is arguing that the SCD isn't needed for people with IBDs,

I think his point is very valid.  I don't think he's even arguing that the
diet may be beneficial to those with celiacs disease--just that it may be
more restrictive than necessary for those who only suffer from gluten
intolerance.  Further, he is cautioning those who might perceive themselves
to be cured of celiacs disease by the diet from returning to their former
eating habits--that certainly isn't a slam of the effectiveness of the diet,
more like an endorsement of its effectiveness.<BR><BR>

I value the information Don provides.  He has answered many questions for me.
 His posts tend to be densely factual and sometimes somewhat clinical--maybe
that style is offputting for some people--but I don't think he has ever
intended to criticize someone or force them to defend themselves for choosing
to live on the SCD.  He is merely a person with a lot of information to offer
and I feel he does each of us a service by providing it--especially when that
means he corrects some misinformation.<BR><BR>

As to whether the diet is for Don, I believes he follows an even more
restrictive form of essentially the same diet.  He is not being critical,
just factual.<BR><BR>

I admit to a flare of impatience that is really quite extraordinary for me.
Perhaps you are right and I have misjudged Don's intent and motives in his
correspondence. He is obviously highly intelligent and his research
thorough. However, I take issue with his repeated &quot;warnings&quot; not to buy
into the diet wholeheartedly, not to beleive in a possible &quot;cure&quot; and
his
questioning of Elaine's painstaking research &amp; theories. I believe that
someone coming into the diet ill, and looking for answers must give the
diet their all in order to get everything from it. It just seems to me that
Don responds to every query with a negetive, proceed with caution, slant. I
admit to mimimal knowledge about celiac disease. I have UC. Elaine claims
that this diet works miracle for many of those with celiac. Based on my own
dealings with the diet and my own healing, I have to beleive she comes from
a place of knowledge and experience. I'm only saying that I'd like to see
someone of Don's caliber, more supportive and less critical. I was
particularly put off with his sentence,
&quot; Actually I think I'll ask Dr. Green what he thinks of this letter. I have
his phone number around here, and know who to ask for his e-mail address.&quot;
Is he suggesting perhaps that Elaine made the letter up?
If I'm sounding overly defensive, it is my reaction to what I perceive as
an attack on Elaine, who has become a dear freind, and on a diet that as
I've said before, has impacted my life in an incredibly strong and positive
way.<BR>

There is nothing nutritionally wrong with a GF diet, and generally it is
healthier as the patient has to avoid prepared foods. It is difficult. I
think these doctors that refuse to give the diagnosis think the diet is
boring and unpalatable. Of course it need not be. Many cuisines of the
world are close to GF, or like Black African are totally GF. South Indian
cuisine is totally GF, and the rest of India has little gluten. Since wheat
doesn't grow in hot climates, that is where one would look for GF cuisine.

To All<BR><BR>

I remember when I was participating in team building sessions at work, several
guidelines were given us.  One was to never personally attack an individual in the
presence of the group. The group was to work together to discuss and reach a consensus.
<BR><BR>
Our group is intended to be like the team I describe above except we may never reach a
consensus.  We are exchanging information and ideas regarding the SCD which is helping
many people.  I think that we all have opinions about the SCD diet.  There are no doubt
those who believe in it in detail to those who believe in parts of it.
<BR><BR>
Elaine is quite a purest about the SCD.  She says over and over that she will not change
one word of the Master (Dr. Haas).

Fax to: Mik Aidt<BR>
From: Elaine Gottschall<BR><BR>

Dear Mik,<BR>
If anyone ever again tries to convince me that, unlike newspapers, radio and TV, that the 
Internet is free of censoring, I will know differently as a result of what has happened 
these past few months.<BR><BR>
Just like me in the 1960'ies when our child and family was saved from destruction by the 
Specific Carbohydrate Diet, Rachel and many others whose lives have also been given back to 
them, will try and try to keep detractors from undermining the diet and the exciting story 
of it
<BR><BR>
Throughout this past week I have heard words like &quot;debate&quot;, &quot;freedom to differ 
in opinion about the diet in my book&quot;, etc.<BR>
But all this has resulted in doing and will continue to do is to DESTRUCTIVELY CANCEL OUT the 
testimonies of the many people whose recoveries have been akin to miracles.
<BR><BR>
In my opinion, a website for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet is not for debate - the truth is 
IMMUTABLE. You, Kevin Arnold, Cyd Van Meter, Deborah Down, Rachel Turet are well and to that list 
we can add hundreds of others. It will not work and will not be supportive if for every word in 
a letter of testimony, someone comes in and undermines its veracity.<BR><BR>
The website/mailing list is not for debate, it is for two main reasons:<BR><BR>
(1) to support those who are on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet by exchanging recipes, personal 
experiences, etc.<BR><BR>
(2) to offer an alternative to those who are searching because the therapy they are now using has not 
been successful. <BR><BR>
It matters not which diet one chooses for celiac as long as the person recovers 
and that includes the return of a healthy mucosa of the small intestine.<BR>
If the gluten-free diet does that and the person is satisfied, fine! But as many tell me in their 
letters, people are going downhill, are continuing to be sickly. They deserve to have a try on the 
Specific Carbohydrate Diet without their efforts being undermined by erratic and confusing 
comments.

<BR><BR>
Yours truly,<BR>
Elaine Gottschall<BR><BR>

Standard policy for mailing lists is to prohibit personal attacks. If the
listowner doesn't take action, which can easily be done with Listserv
software, then it can degenerate into a flame fest. I'm not on the IBD
List, but I get the impression the sides are making personal attacks on the
other side. No one has said lists are democracies. Anybody that doesn't
like the way a list is run is free to quit.<BR><BR>

Rachel made no attempt to debate, she whined instead.<BR><BR>

I still haven't seen anybody here detract from the diet for people with
IBDs.There are no celiacs on this list following the SCD that I am aware
of, though there may be a lurking IBSer. All people following it have IBDs.
My biggest difference with the SCD is her insistence on including some
dairy, but I haven't said to anybody here they shouldn't include it in
their diet.<BR><BR>

I see everything is testimonials. I guess this sells books and brings in
royalties, but one gets respect from the medical community by doing studies
in a little more controlled manner. Any study would have a medical
professional test before and after, and not rely solely on what someone,
never even met in person, says. Do note that Wolfgang Lutz does have
respect. But then he has published in peer reviewed medical journals, which
gives lots of respect to the author. His &quot;The Colonisation of Europe and
Our Western Diseases&quot; in Medical Hypotheses is especially well regarded.<BR><BR>

Nor do I see how debate will destructively cancel out people's recoveries,
and they may even be able to improve on them. Doesn't she admit that the
SCD isn't for everybody? I guess she casts those people aside, instead of
adapting her diet to their specific needs.<BR><BR>

Maybe for IBDs, but the evidence isn't there that it is needed for gluten
intolerance. Nor is it immutable that people on her diet are &quot;cured&quot; as she
claims. Using a hyped word, instead of controlled or in remission, is
probably the biggest reason she doesn't get much respect from the medical

I think the word for this is being hypocritical. Elaine Gottschall is not a

Anybody can set up mailing lists. I'll even suggest a place where she can

question that it is her list. She can then set any rule she wants.

(2) Discussion of the differences of Dr. Walter L. Voegtlin's diet  as

(3) Starting on spring water and an elemental diet, then adding foods to<BR>
see what bugs you or not. As based on Crohn's Disease: Maintenance of
Remission By Diet. Alun, Jones, ... et al,  Lancet. Volume V.II, 1985.
Pages 177-180.<BR>
(4) Pros and cons of including dairy in the diet. And of using dairy-free
acidophilus instead.<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;and that includes the return of a healthy mucosa of the small intestine. If<BR>

One of the problems is the extreme difficulty in following a gluten-free
diet without support. The first book to help people wasn't written until
more than 20 years after they announced that the gluten-free diet was the
way to go. The first support group wasn't started until even later. How was
someone to know where gluten was hidden in foods? I'm not even sure how
good the labeling laws were back in the 50's. I even know adult celiacs
today, that go it alone and despite trying, have a diet that is far from
being gluten-free. I don't think it is possible to be GF without some
outside knowledge helping you.<BR><BR>

they're eating and help them find where the hidden gluten is slipping in.<BR><BR>

&gt;I have a<BR>
&gt;question, and I kinda feel dumb for not knowing, but what is Celiac<BR>
&gt;disease?<BR><BR></FONT>

Very simply it is intolerance to gluten. Gluten is a *protein* that is
found in all wheat (more so in bread and pasta), but also found in lesser
quantity in spelt, rye, barley, oats and all foodstuffs containing one of
these grains, including many food chemicals like hydrolyzed vegetable
protein (called &quot;flavorings&quot; or &quot;natural flavors&quot; in the ingredient list).
<BR><BR>
Gluten in celiacs has four major effects: (1) antibodies against it are
produced by the body and are circulating. They can create skin, joint and
neurological problems. (2) The intestinal villi are compromised and
minerals and vitamins are malabsorbed. This can lead to all sorts of
non-specific deficiencies. (3) There can be a leaky gut which allows
peptides to get through that shouldn't. They can accumulate in the kidneys
and possibly get through the blood brain barrier if that is compromised for
some reason, and (4) addictive opioids can be formed in the gut causing the
person to crave gluten containing foods.
<BR><BR>
The condition is controlled with a strict gluten-free diet. It is not
considered an IBD. For more information this page points to all Net resources:

Celiac disease can be concurrent with Crohn's. I doubt many get the second
