Canadian <B>Elaine Gottschall</B>'s book 
&quot;Breaking The Vicious Cycle&quot;, introducing &quot;The Specific
Carbohydrate Diet&quot; 
is the basis for 
the SCD online support group which was started in August 1996. Her book has sold
over 
250,000 copies so far.<BR>
        As it turns out, the Austrian doctor <A HREF="mailto:wolfgang.lutz@aon.at"><B>Wolfgang 
        Lutz</B></A> has published another book, &quot;Life Without Bread&quot;, 
        which suggests a very simular diet, though based on different hypothesises. 
        &quot;Life Without Bread&quot; has sold close to 80,000 copies, most of 
        them in German. The English version of this book is entitled &quot;Dismantling 
        a Myth - The Role of Fat and Carbohydrates in our Diet&quot;, and there is also a new version 
        out, entitled 'Life Without Bread: How a Low-Carbohydrate Diet Can Save
     Your Life' (Authors: Christian B. Allan, Ph.D. and Wolfgang Lutz, M.D.)<br>
     
<BR>None of us in the
 online support group had read it, most of us had never heard about 'Life Without Bread',
  when the correspondence about Dr. Lutz began in our group in April 1997.
 The <A HREF="scdlutz.html#ANCHOR01">letters below</A> on this page illustrate
how it all began.<BR>

<B>Experiences and theories of Dr. Wolfgang Lutz</B> </B><BR>
Sat, 19 Apr 1997 18:08:10 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi All,<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 - one year after I was diagnosed: ulcerative colitis / Crohn's - 
I contacted a homeopath who told me about a an Austrian doctor named Wolfgang
Lutz.  
This doctor apparently had achieved some very good results by treating his
patients 
with a diet low in (refined) carbohydrates.<P>
<BR>
The homeopath gave me a couple of photocopied pages of an article from 1987, in
German.  
The article was printed in the Munich Medical Journal (<I>Muenchener Medizinische

Wochenschrift)</I> Nr. 50, 1987.  I don't speak German very well, so I couldn't 
really figure out what he had written.  But now, finally,  I have had it
translated 
(to Danish, placed <A HREF="http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/dk6.html">here</A>) 
- and I am surprised that his theories are SO similar to Elaine Gottschall's. 
<BR>
Wolfgang Lutz writes that he has treated and helped - if not cured - more than
80% of his 
600 German patients who had Colitis / Crohn's.  He also writes that there is a
great 
difference in how a person responds to the low-carbohydrate diet, depending on
whether 
the person has Colitis or Crohn's.<P>
<BR>
Wolfgang Lutz has obtained extremely good results with curing Crohn's, he says: 
he states most of his patients have been totally cured within two years - whereas

colitis ulcerosa is much harder to get rid of through diet.<P>
<BR>
I find it quite fascinating that people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, 
apparently without knowing about one another, have the same experiences and 
come to the same conclusions!  I have looked for information about this 
Wolfgang Lutz and his theories on the Internet, but with no luck.<P>
<BR>
I have heard that he has also published a book: &quot;<B><I>Leben ohne
Brot</I></B>&quot;
 (<B><I>&quot;Life without Bread&quot;)</I></B> ... if any of you have heard
about him and 
 knows more about his writings, I would love to hear about it, and will post / 
 pass on the info either via this web-page, or the SCD list-server.<P>
<BR>
	Yours,<BR>
	<I><A HREF="mailto:mik@inform-bbs.dk">Mik</A></I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>PS:</B> If there are any Danes among the members of this SCD mailing list:, 
(or if there is anyone of you out there who reads Danish) you'll find the 
article in full at: <A HREF="http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/dk6.html">

<BR>

<BR>
<B>Abstract of the article in English:</B> <BR><BR>

&quot;Low-Carbohydrate Diet in Crohn's Disease:<BR>
A Low-Carbohydrate Diet (72 g/24 h) has a very favourable effect on
patients with Crohn's disease. Symptoms and signs tend to subside after
6 months in 70, after one year in 80 and after 1 1/2 years in 90% of the
instances. Obviously there is no tendency of relapses, contrary to
ulcerative colitis which also reacts to this diet favourably. Since
nearly all gastrointestinal patients tend to accelerate the passage of
ingesta through their intestines, the idea arises that ingesta not fully
degraded are &quot;persorbed&quot; in the terminal ileum and cause allergic
reactions with granulomatous lesions typical for Crohn's disease.&quot;

 <B>Wolfgang Lutz - the continued story</B><BR>
Fri, 16 May 1997 22:41:55 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi everyone in the Group,<BR>
<BR>
Today I received a letter from Dr. Wolfgang Lutz in Austria that 
I want to share with all of you. It has really been encouraging to 
learn that in Austria there lives a doctor who since the 1950's has 
researched and written about the role of carbohydrates in diet - and 
in particular, the relationship between Crohn's / colitis and a 
low-refined-carbohydrate diet. 
<BR>
He writes that he himself has &quot;adhered to this diet and has 
observed for over 26 years its effects on well over 10.000 patients&quot;, 
as he states in the preface to the English edition. 
<BR>
In his letter, Wolfgang Lutz enclosed a copy of the English version 
of his book &quot;Life Without Bread&quot; as published in 1986, 
entitled: &quot;Dismantling a Myth - The Role of Fat and Carbohydrate in our
Diet&quot; 
<BR>
For SCD'ers, chapter 7 -&quot;Gastrointestinal Tract&quot; (53 pages, 
from page 127 to 180) - is interesting reading!<BR>
<BR>
Is there maybe someone in the group who'd have the time to type it in, 
so we can place on the SCD website? 
<BR>
In any case, you'll hear more about this as we go on... 
<BR>
Wishing you well, all of you. It's nice to be part of this group.<BR>
<BR>
	Yours,<BR>

Dear Mik<BR>
<BR>
Thank you very much for your letter of 08.05.97 and the enclosure. 
I am in touch with the Price-Pottenger Foundation (<I>editor's note:</I> 
<I>actual name is &quot;Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation&quot;, can be found
at</I> 
<A
HREF="http://members.aol.com/ppnf/main.html">http://members.aol.com/ppnf/main.html</A>)
 
which is spreading books on nutrition.  They have promised to publish 
&quot;Life without Bread&quot; in America.<BR>
<BR>
I am notwithstanding thankful for the address given by you.<BR>
<BR>
With separate mail I send a copy of a pilot edition of the book in 
English to you.  We have had an American publisher, which, 
unfortunately, did not move very much to promote the book in 
1988, so it got out of print some years ago ... lost years.  
But some people had got a copy and contacted me,  I am including a recent
letter.<BR>
<BR>
I will contact Mrs. Elaine Gottschall by fax and I would be thankful 
if you could put me into the Internet.  Unfortunately, I have only 
some days ago ordered a PC and am not yet familiar with the Internet, 
it will take some time but I am sure I will manage it in the end.<BR>
<BR>

<B>Lutz article in &quot;Medical Hypothesis&quot;</B>, <BR>
Sat, 17 May 1997 16:20:59 GMT<BR>
<BR>

Dr. Wolfgang Lutz, in the face of epidemiological studies that failed to support 
the current belief that fat intake was at the root of coronary disease and
cancer, 
has done his own explorations of epidemiological data.<BR><BR>

His findings show a clear, inverse relationship between these civilisatory
diseases 
and the length of time the people of a given region of Europe have had to adapt
to 
the high carbohydrate diet associated with the cultivation of cereal grains that
was 
begun in the Near East, and spread very slowly through Europe. (1)<BR><BR>

<BR>
Hi All,<BR>
<BR>
Just received a letter from Elaine Gottschall who sent me a copy of a fax that
she has
sent to Dr. Wolfgang Lutz in Austria. It explains about about the relationship
between these two 
&quot;prominent&quot; carbohydrate researchers. 
<BR>
<BR>
________________________________________________<BR><BR>
<B>Letter from Elaine Gottschall to Wolfgang Lutz:</B><BR><BR>

<TT>May 26, 1997<BR>
Dear Dr. Lutz,<BR>
Was so surprised and delighted to again hear from you (your letter of May 11,
1997). How could
you possibly remember your correspondence with me about 20 years ago when I saw
your letter in
Nutrition Today.<BR><BR>

I have your book, Life Withour Bread, and have recommended it to many who are
sceptical of the
conventional wisdom of fat being the culprit for everything and anything.<BR><BR>

Your past letter did not carry a date but at that time you had sold only 150
books. How wonderful
that now the total is up to 80,000!<BR><BR>

In your first letter to me, you talk about gliadin and I realize that like
cholesterol, gliadin has
been conventionally blamed for celiac disease. I had the good fortune of being
around when the cure
 for celiac was also perverted and just recently wrote a history of this disease
which I am
 enclosing.
  
  Although my hypothesis for the corbohydrate specific diet in my newer book,
Breaking the Vicious
 Cycle, may be different from your hypothesis as to what the mechanism of action
is, the fact is we 
 are RIGHT. So much points in our direction:<BR>
 (1) The reversal of epilepsy with the high fat diet which is really a very low
carbohydrate diet<BR>
 (2) The reduction of weight in the &quot;Carbohydrate Addict's Diet&quot; by
Heller and Heller, 
 and, of course<BR>
 (3) The Atkins Diet which has been low in carbohydrate.<BR><BR>
 
 We have sold over 250,000 books on this subject but not without a struggle but
what
  gratificiation one receives with every person who has had his/her life given
back to him/her.<BR><BR>
  
  We have planted good seed and let us hope that we will live long and in good
health so we can
   continue to help people in this political climate where biology has been
trashed and politics 
   reigns supreme.<BR><BR>
   
   Sincerely,<BR><BR>
   Elaine Gottschall, M.Sc.<BR><BR>

Subject: Re: Flare up<BR><BR>


if you give up on the SCD diet please read Dr Wolfgang Lutz's diet
for colitis/chron's at:


<P>
http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/scdlutz.html


<P>
it describes a diet which limits your carbohydrate intake to 72 grams daily
max, while eating all the protein and fat that you want, you will eat more then
less as you progress on the diet.


<P>lutz writes that it takes about 2 years for 60% of his colitis
patients to enter remission, and it takes about 5 years for 80% to reach
remission. he also uses the diet for MS, heart disease, and arthiritis.
he says people with chron's do best without relapse. 


<P>it certainly is interesting, the book is out of print, but
i read it after finding it at the local university. you can read the chapter
on the GI tract online.


<P>
hope you get some help eventually.

<B>Lutz and the evolution of our intestines</B> </B><BR>
Sun, 15 June 1997 11:41:23 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Consider this: <BR>
<BR>
Life on earth began some 3,250,000,000 years ago. Now, to get a more clear
idea about the evolution of our eating habits, let's imagine that life on
earth began 650 years ago, in the Middle Ages, year 1350. If this was the
case, then the mammels appeared on the surface of earth only around 45 years
ago. (=225,000,000 years ago). <BR>
The first humans, the Homo Sapiens, left the rain forests of East Africa,
and began hunting on the savannahs 1 year ago (=5,000,000 years ago), learning
to create fire and build weapons for the hunting.<BR>
We did that for a whole year untill the invention of agriculture, enabling
us to settle down, specialize in trading and build cities, came into our
lives 14 hours ago (=8,000 years ago). Our stomachs have only had to deal
with the consumption of white sugar since approximately 21 minutes ago (=
200 years ago).<BR>
<BR>

I was looking in some of my old books to find one of those &quot;If
life on earth were a 1-hour film, but couldn't find it. Then I looked up
the facts in a lexicon and started with the calculator, because 
I think the 14 hours compared to one year gives you some kind of an impression
of what it is Lutz (and others) are talking about, concerning<BR>
carbohydrates and what our intestines is &quot;built&quot; for.<BR>
<BR>

If you find these theories of Lutz intesting, you will also find the Paleodiet
Listserver group <I>really</I> interesting. 
There has been a continual discussion about the absence of grains in the early
Man's diet.<BR>
<BR>
We have posted two of the letters from the discussion here:<BR>
 <A HREF="lutz/paleo1.html">Response to molecular mimicry comments - 17 Jun
1997</A> and<BR>
 <A HREF="lutz/paleo2.html">Enig &amp; Fallon Reply to Dr. Cordain - 29 Jun

<BR><BR>
Also, you should visit Raymond Audette's web site of &quot;NeanderThin&quot;:<BR>
<A
HREF="http://www.sofdesign.com/neander/">http://www.sofdesign.com/neander/</A><BR>
To touch bases with him: in his latest comments he talks about how he cured
himself of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and how other people who've
tried the diet have (among other illnesses) cured themselves of colitis.<BR>
Raymond Audette is an author, living in Texas.<BR>
<BR>
The web site also contains a &quot;Low Carbohydrate Diets Information

Lutz' diet looks very much like the SCD. It is not as extreme, though, but 
generally, it is the same things that should be avoided.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, in Lutz's diet bread is allowed, if only you eat very little of 
it.<BR>

Subject: <B>Dr Voegtlin's &quot;Stone Age Diet&quot;</B><BR><BR>

Dr. Walter L. Voegtlin was a gastrointerologist who's book &quot;The Stone Age
Diet&quot; was self-published in 1975.  It was based on the treatment he used
for decades to treat colitis, Krones Disease, Irritated Bowel Syndrome,
and indigestion.  It can still be obtained through inter-library loan (OK
State U has a copy).<BR><BR>

The diet described is very similar to &quot;NeanderThin&quot; except that he
allows
some dairy products (those that contain no sweet milk) and forbids most
fruits and vegetables.  The few fruits and vegetables he does allow must
be cooked and separated from their juices. For people who are &quot;only&quot;
obese he does allow a few raw fruits and vegetables.<BR><BR>

Dr. Voegtlin justifies this more carnivores approach by point out that in
almost part of the world, vegatable consumption is very seasonal.
Without the recent invention of canning, they are practically imposible
to obtain during winter or the dry seasons that occur everywhere.  He
references all known hunter-gatherers to make this point.<BR><BR>

As does my book, he also states that the human digestive system most
closly resembles that of a dog.  He does this in three chapters and
concludes with charts that compare man to dogs and herbavores.  These
charts compare; teeth, jaws, stomach, colon, cecum, gallbladder,
digestive activity, feeding habits, ratio of body lenth to total
digestive tract and small intestine, and survival after removal stomach,
colon and cecum, microorganisms, plant food and animal proteins.<BR><BR>

His book discourages the use of laxatives or high fiber suplements
claiming they only irritate and strain the system.  He also covers the
history of vitamins claiming that they weren't considered important to the
average person until farmers discovered that they could be used to sell
fresh vegetables at exhorbitant prices to gullible yankees during winter.
<BR><BR>
I'm doing some research on Dr. Voegtlin and will hopefully report more
about him in future posts.<BR><BR>

Such a scenario on the celiac list can happen when a celiac's gluten-free 
diet isn't strict enough. This is because often the digestive system will 
become ever more sensitive to smaller amounts of gluten as it heals. For 
these people I ask that they write out in detail what they're eating, so I 
can analyze it. Celiacs will often try to keep packaged foods in their diet.<BR>
<BR>
Then I'd really like to see a comparison of the three published IBD diets.<BR>
The differences may be useful for helping Tom tweak his diet.<BR>

Dr. Walter L. Voegtlin's diet, which is touted as being for colitis and 
Crohn's, does allow some dairy products (those that contain no sweet milk)
and forbids most fruits and vegetables. The few fruits and vegetables he

swede (rutabaga). Many of these are allowed on the SCD, but must be 
troubling to some people.<BR>
<BR>
I hope some of these ideas are successful for Tom.<BR>

Subject: <B>Dr. Lutz: &quot;Life without bread&quot;; 
Dr. D'Adamo: &quot;Eat right for your type&quot;</B><BR>
<BR>

Hi everybody!<BR><BR>

First I want to say that I don&yen;t understand the reasons for setting up
another mailing list. I have always enjoyed discussions about the
aspects that go beyond the SCD. In my opinion no one woman or one man is
able to find &quot;the diet&quot; that suits all sufferers from IBD. Our greatest
problem is lack of information, especially on the part of doctors.
Limiting ourselves to discussing only E. Gottschall's book (as much as I
appreciate it) in my eyes means limiting the chances for some of us to
get better. The SCD points in the right direction but it doesn't
necessarily have to be the magic key to IBD.<BR><BR>

So we have to collect what other doctors found to be effective in
healing IBD, and by comparing different strategies we might find out
what they have in common. On this basis everyone will then be able to
finetune their diet according to their specific needs. E.g. I found out
that I do much better without dairy products and by reading Dr. D'Adamos
book &quot;Eat right 4 your type&quot; I found out why: dairy products commonly
don't agree with my blood type (A).
<BR><BR>
Before I tell you what I learned from Dr. Lutz's book I want to let you
know my experience with &quot;budesonid&quot; (brand name:Entocort) enemas. About
2 months ago, after aprox. 3 months on the SCD, I started feeling worse.
A rectoscopy showed excessive inflammation of my lower colon (the area
where it has been before). You guys know what that means: blood, mucous,
frequent bowel movements etc. For the first time I opted for a cortison
drug, and this budesonid seems to have helped enormously. I have been
using it for 2 weeks now and since I stopped having dairy products I
have got much better: one bowel movement a day, normal stool, some
blood. And it seems I am getting better and better. I don't only
attribute my improvement to the drug but as much as I dislike drugs I
know they are necessary sometimes.<BR><BR>

Dr. Lutz's book, as you who have read the excerpt on [this] site now, is
based on the theory that the human digestive tract has not adapted to
our westernized high carbohydrate diet. Therefore he recommends a diet
limited to a daily intake of 70-80g of carbos. Contrary to the SCD he
does not differenciate between good and bad carbos, just the daily
amount is important. As to why this diet helps in most cases of IBD he
does not give an explanation in &quot;Life without bread&quot;. But he does so in
his new book &quot;Sick stomach, sick bowel, what really helps&quot;: Without
being able to repeat the medical details the bottom line is that to many
carbos cause a faster passage of food through the digestive tract, and
this causes especially the ends of the small and big bowel to inflame
because of the not properly digested food. So according to Dr. Lutz eat
like our prehistorian ancestors: lots of meat and some vegies and fruit.
<BR><BR>
This dietary recommendation is largely confirmed by Dr. D'Adamo in his
book &quot;Eat right 4 your type&quot;. He reveals a very interesting connection
between a person's bloodtype and dietary regimes following therefrom.
The bottom line of this book is: Eat as the ancestors of your bloodtype
did, and since most people have bloodtype &quot;0&quot; it is best for them to
have lots of meat and hardly any grains. As for my bloodtype &quot;A&quot; more
grains and no red meat is recommended, I can have fish though. Get a
copy of the book! It is definitely worth reading.
<BR><BR>
Since grains are forbidden on the SCD and the intake of the remaining
foods containing carbos will probably not exceed 80g/day my conclusion
is that these three diets are basically the same according to the
majority of the people. Interesting, isn't it?
<BR><BR>
As for me I am going to stick with the SCD trying to limit my
carbohydrate intake and finetuning it following Dr. D'Adamos
recommendations as to which foods are BENEFICIAL, NEUTRAL ore
DETRIMENTAL for my bloodtype. It seems to work. And never forget the
psychological implications of your disease, mostly it is not only diet!
<BR><BR>
If anyone is interested in the parts of Dr. Lutz's new book concerning
IBD I can mail it to him/her, in German though!<BR><BR>

All the best<BR><BR>

&quot;I converted 80g to ounces and it's about 3 ounces.  That's about one<BR>

Following Dr. Lutz's theory that too many Carbos speeds up digestion and<BR>

the SCD would contribute to inflammation rather than calm it.&quot;<BR></FONT>
<BR>
In terms of the 80g carbos a day what counts is the amount of carbos in<BR>
certain foods. There are foods that are pure carbohydrate like sugar or<BR>
flour. Others contain a certain percentage. So lets say apples contain<BR>
10% carbos (it is a bit more) you would be allowed to have 800g of<BR>
apples a day. &quot;Life without bread&quot; contains a list of different
foods<BR>
with their respective carbohydrate content. According to this most<BR>
vegies contain around 5-7% carbohydrates. So you can have quite a lot of<BR>
vegies everyday. Excessive intake of fruit is not very positiv, though.<BR>
<BR>
As for your other question, Dr. Lutz allows bread and products made from<BR>
flour in the diet (even potatoes), but due to their high carbohydrate<BR>
content the amounts are very small.<BR>
<BR>
For myself I decided to keep on forgoing these foods and stick with<BR>
vegies and fruits.<BR>

Subject: <B>paleodiet</B><BR><BR>

Ellen (and all),<BR><BR>

I'm not sure this discussion is appropriate for this list, but since it's
inspired by some remarks Ellen made on the list, here goes anyway.  Also,
this is a long post, my first one, for which I ask forgiveness.<BR><BR>

&lt;&lt;The author [of _Neanderthin_] advocates a paleo diet which eliminates all
foods which could not
be ingested without the aid of technology.&gt;&gt; (Ellen)<BR><BR>

I haven't read this particular version of  &quot;the&quot; hunter-gatherer diet,
but
I would like to point out that the reason the human race gave up on this
type of diet around 13,000 years ago was a global climatic catastrophe: the
melting of the ice sheets.  With the disappearance of the ice came the
disappearance of tundra and the increase in the growth of forests, with the
concomitant disappearance of the large herds of grazing animals that
constituted the principal source of human protein at the time.
Agriculture, which people were probably aware of all along but which, in
the presence of easy-to-hunt protein was a relatively ineffecient source of
food, came to the fore at that time, and technology was developed
(irrigation, new forms of cooking, plows, oxen, etc.) that increased the
nutrtional yield from plant foods (over plain gathering).  Of course, the
impact on human social life was profound: the agricultural revolution, the
evolution of fixed settlements, cities, etc., down to modern times (a mere
blip of 10,000 years in human history).  For background, I recommend Marvin
Harris' books &quot;Our Kind,&quot; and &quot;Cannibals and Kings.&quot;<BR><BR>

Paleo-enthusiasts should consider the problem of the entire species
adopting their diet (as opposed to a few people like ourselves with
specific medical problems).  I mean, what are we all supposed to do?  The
agricultural revolution, disaster as it may have been in many ways,
happened basically out of necessity.   Although perhaps difficult for
SCDers and celiac sufferers, I think as a race we're stuck with agriculture
in one form or another (this doesn't mean there's no necessity for vast
improvement!).<BR><BR>

Then there's the &quot;diet for a small planet&quot; problem.  Growing grain to
feed
animals is a very inefficient way to produce protein for humans.  Remember
&quot;Diet for a Small Planet?&quot;<BR><BR>

&lt;&lt;The diet eliminates all grains and starchy
vegetables (among other things).&gt;&gt;<BR><BR>

BTW, it's not at all clear to me that paleodiets are or were starch-free.
Many modern hunter-gatherers depend on roots they dig up, for example the
&quot;yams&quot; (not the sweet potatoes we call &quot;yams&quot;) in use all
over the Pacific
Islands.  These were a mainstay of the Pacific Islanders at the time the
Europeans showed up there.<BR><BR>

Also worth checking out is &quot;Native Nutrtion: Eating according to ancestral
wisdom,&quot; by Ronald Schmid, N.D.  He summarizes much of the research on
hunter-gather diets and health and longevity.  Yes, agriculture -- cooked
grains -- turns out to be a problem, but chiefly for our teeth.  In terms
of protection against (non-dental) chronic disease, certain
agriculturalists at any rate seem to do OK.  (The more raw foods the
better, though.  Again, difficult for us SCDers.)<BR><BR>

With regard to meat, Schmid also points out that &quot;primitive people's&quot;
diets
focus much more on the organs of their prey -- heart, liver, brains, etc.
-- than on the muscle meat that we eat.  Organs of course are a big source
of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, not just protein.  But of
course, 13,000 years ago animal livers were not full of the carcinogens
modern cows' and chickens' etc. are.<BR><BR>

Also, Schmid points out that the fat composition of meat changes when range
animals have their diets changed to grains.  Range-fed animal fat tends to
have an EPA composition similar to that of cold-water fish (which seems to
be protective against a range of chronic diseases).  So supermarket beef
would be not be very helpful here.  Even &quot;range-fed&quot; animals are
usually
fattened up on grain for the last couple of months of their lives -- which
changes the EPA content of their body fat.  (And if the use of
&quot;technology&quot;
is at issue for the paleos, that pretty much cancels out anything from the
supermarket.  Consider the technology involved in modern cattle-farming,
from stable to table!)<BR><BR>

In this regard, Lutz (and others) have pointed to studies showing that the
French have less heart disease than others, though they eat more butter fat
(they're famous for it -- and their butter is delicious!).  Perhaps the
reason for this is that dairy cattle there are grass fed (not grain fed);
this changes the quality of the milk, and milk fat, and makes it more
protective.   Cf the studies discussed by Schmid.  (Perhaps also, probably
at least a third of the French eat a &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; which has
been
shown to be protective against heart disease.)<BR>
One more point about Lutz' theory.  The agricultural revolution has been
around for more than 10,000 years.  This is plenty of time for evolutionary
adaptation to agricultural products, and so the evolutionary argument --
that we should eat the way we evolved a million years ago -- is not
conclusive here.  Case in point: people in Northern Europe have evolved so
as to be able to eat lactose from cow's milk without any problem -- not
counting IBDers, of course. : -)  (a combination of living in places where
sunlight, hence Vit. D, is in short supply for large parts of the year, and
the availability of dairy).  The point I'm trying to make is that there are
a lot of complicated issues here: it's not just a matter of
&quot;technology&quot;
(although yes, that is one issue -- especially modern food-processing
technology, involving growth hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, oil-based
fertilizers, etc).<BR><BR>

Again, sorry this post is so long, and so rambling.  But I hope it's
interesting to somebody.<BR><BR>

&gt;Dear Mik, <BR>
&gt;I am very interested to know if Wolfgang Lutz book is going to be in

&gt;again and was wondering if you knew anything.  I am new to the SCD net
page.<BR>
&gt; My husband has Crohn's Disease and to make a 34 year story short, he has
had<BR>
&gt;many ups and down times including 4 surgeries.  The last surgery, an<BR>
&gt;emergency one 18 hours after his 3rd surgery, about killed him.  This
surgery<BR>
&gt;was one year ago and he has battled recovery since.  He is told now that
he<BR>
&gt;has good bowel left with no active Crohn's but only 8 feet small bowel
left.<BR>
&gt; So he is dealing with short bowel syndrome, keeping the Crohn's at bay
and<BR>
&gt;weaning off of 18 years of prednisone.  We have searched and tried many<BR>
&gt;alternative approaches to dealing with this terrible disease.  I have
read<BR>
&gt;the 7th chapter of Wolfgang Lutz's book online and am desperate to find
his<BR>
&gt;book.  If it is not going to be in print for a while, I was wondering if
you<BR>
&gt;could share the diet part of the book with us now until it is in print. 
My<BR>
&gt;husband is not doing well as far as eating although he is being sustained<BR>
&gt;through TPN or IV feeding.  He has been on TPN for 2 months now and I am at
a<BR>
&gt;loss as how to feed him.  Any help you can give me would greatly be<BR>
&gt;appreciated.  <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thank You,<BR>
&gt;Sharon<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear Sharon,<BR>
Thanks for your letter.<BR>
I am very sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds really terrible!<BR>
One of the reasons I have only placed in particular chapter 7 of Lutz's book,
&quot;Dismantling a Myth&quot;, is that this chapter is the only one that
specifically touches the subject of digestion and intestines, Crohns and Colitis.
The rest of the book speaks of other subjects concerning &quot;Myths&quot; about
cholesterol and fat, about the evolution of man, etc.<BR>
What I find fascinating about Lutz's experiences is that he, independently,
apparently has come the very same conclusions as Elaine Gottschall (the author of
&quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; which is the basis of the Specific
Carbohydrate Diet) but based on quite different grounds and theories. <BR>
Having had great success with Elaine's Canadian diet myself, I find it
interesting to learn that Lutz at the same time has been successful treating his
Colitis/Crohns patients with a simular low-carbohydrate diet in Germany and
Austria. <BR>
Lutz's experiences shows that a low-carbohydrate diet makes a lot of sense and
that it probably is much more important to health in general than the
&quot;establishment&quot; likes to hear.<BR>
But even so, it seems to me that the Specific Carbohydrate Diet is... yes, more
&quot;specific&quot; and certainly more &quot;focused&quot; in particular at
solving intestinal problems. <BR>
To me, SCD is like &quot;medicine&quot;, while Lutz is
&quot;philosophy&quot;.<BR>
Lutz's book IS out of print in English. <BR>
Hopefully, a new edition will come out within a years time.<BR>
In the meanwhile, I'll highly recommend to you to get hold of Elaine Gottschall's
book. For a person like your husband I believe it will be much more
beneficial.<BR>
I do have a copy of Lutz's book, (which was sent to me directly from the author)
and if you are very insisting, I COULD make a photocopy and mail it to you. <BR>
But as you can see, I hardly think it is worth the effort,1) because the rest of
the book is NOT about intestinal problems, 2) because the SCD diet is much more
extensive, detailed, and directed towards intestinal problems.<BR>
Concerning the content of the SCD diet, once you have the book, there is a lot of
advice to obtain from subscribing to the SCD mailing lists. (See at the SCD Web
Library).<BR>
<BR>
Sharon, I wish the best for your husband, and for you too!<BR>
<BR>
Yours,<BR>
Mik

<B>Fax from Informed Gmbh, 20/08/1998, AT/MT-NR2151<BR></B>
<BR>
Life Without Bread<BR>
<BR>
What is new in the recently released 14th edition?<BR>
<BR>
1.) The evolutionary theory includes the new Adeptation Theory published by the
author in<BR>
- Wiener Klin. Wochenschrift 1989,101,429<BR>
- Wiener Med. Wochenschrift 1994,367<BR>
- Medical Hypotheses, 1995,45,115<BR>
<BR>
This theory not only shows that it is in fact the corbohydrates which cause the
civilisatory diseases in Europe (and from there in the parts of the world which
have been settled by Europeans), but is explains the differences in the incidence
among European peoples as well. It also shows that curbing carbohydrates is the
only way of getting rid of all these ailments as it is obvious that it would need
further 5,000 years or more with high carbohydrate intake and the accompanying
diseases to render our genom carbohydrate resitent for most of human beings and
futher 10-20,000 years to eradicate our diseases for all people eating much
carbohydrate, an ominous threat for mankind.<BR>
<BR>
The adaption theory shows a solution for the &quot;French Paradox&quot;, the fact
that the French suffer only 1/5 of strokes and myocardial infarctions of the
Finns though both consurme about the same amount and quality of fat; The French
have been settled by Romans which, as a Mediterranian people, were already pretty
adapted to carbohydrates against the Finns which got agriculture and
carbohydrates much later and are still less adapted to this modern nutrient. A
similar process leads to a decrease of heart infarcts in the USA owing to the
late immigration from Mediterranean people with aldready good adaptation coming
now into the age of infarcts and strokes.<BR>
<BR>
2.) Initiated by the author and Dr. E. Idris there was conducted a propestive
randomised study by German gastroenterologists to assess the efficacy of a low
carbohydrate diet in Crohn's disease as asserted by the author in several papers.
It showed a cease of relapses after between 90 and 200 days of diet in contrary
to former English and German studies on a low sugar otherwise
carbohydrate-unrestricted diet confirming the authors conviction that not only
sugar but all carbohydrates are to be restricted to reap the effects of a low
carbohydrate diet.<BR>
<BR>
3.) From the chapter of the metabolic syndrom, arterial hypertension has been
excluded because this ailment obviously is caused by salt and only in its effects
on the arteries is to be included in deliberations about carbohydrates. The
author gives his notion about the causes and developments of high blood pressure
based on the vision that humans after having passed the aquatic period with salty
food from the sea had to adapt millions of years to a salt-free environment and
got only of new in contact to salt in the Neolithic, where salt was traded from
sea shores or salt mining locations to settlements not to mention the misuse of
salt in modern societies.<BR>
<BR>
4.) Side Effects<BR>
There are two of them able to disquiet persons not intimate with the diets
working in the hormonal system.<BR>
a. The obvious increase of growth hormon levels which causes swelling and
bleeding of the gums especially in former adipose patients, and<BR>
b. reduction of sexual hormons. Both, [a] and [b] are probably caused by the
decrease of insulin levels with less carbohydrate eaten; both are limited to
several months and disappear without leaving symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
5.) Point of no return?<BR>
Clinical experience and animal experiments by the author show that our principal
adversarary, arteriosclerosis, is favourably influenced by a low carbohydrate
diet. But not every far advanced patient can be surely safed from a breakdown in
some areas of the arterial system in which the defect in the inner walls of an
artery has reached a certain degree. It is therefore important to begin with the
diet as early as possible and to install in endangered patients measures
(aspirin, etc.) which are apt to cover a certain time span from the beginning of
the diet.<BR>

<BR>
Recently I read a fascinating article which I accessed via the SCD Web 
page. One of the many interesting points was that since colitis is an 
auto-immune disease, every time a colitis sufferer's immune system is 
triggered by a health-threatening virus or bacterium entering the body, the 
immune system will also attack the bowel. So Martine must have contracted 
some bug which triggered this off. <BR>
(Is Crohn's colitis like ulcerative colitis or is it Crohn's of the large 
bowel?) <P>
The article stated that the immune system never forgets that the bowel was 
once considered an enemy (when it had active disease), but then the author 
kind of contradicts that point and goes on to say (more positively) that as 
years go by with a healed bowel, the immune system does not bother 
attacking the bowel as much any more and in some cases it actually does 
eventually leave the bowel alone - just as some of our immunities (eg 
chicken pox) may wear off over time and in later years we can catch it 
again as shingles. <P>
SOmehow we have to both heal the bowel (with diet)and convince the confused 
immune system that the bowel is no longer an &quot;enemy&quot;.  
The author is Dr Wolfgang Lutz, whose theories have been discussed in 
earlier archives of this list.  He can be tracked down, as I mentioned, via 
the SCD Web Site.  I heartily recommend reading him - especially Crohnies. 
He and Elaine have corresponded by letter. 
 <P>
Personally, I have come to the conclusion that it is imperative to use as 
much cortisone as it takes to subdue a flare as soon as possible - to &quot;nip 
it in the bud&quot;, so that the I.S. doesn't get back into the habit of 
attacking the bowel again. This usually means, for us, more than 25 mg, 
decreasing carefully. Otherwise we find that things just deteriorate. 
 <P>
I think you are doing exactly the right thing keeping her on protein foods 
and meat/veg soup.  We have found that when things are bad, GO LO-CHO - ie 
Keep away from fruit and honey and dine only on low carbohydrate foods.

<BR>Subject: <B>Re: Corn, rice, etc.</B>
 <BR><BR>Eileen:
 <BR><BR>I subscribe to a number of low carb and stone age diet lists and rice
and corn are always shown as difficult for human digestion. I also have
a number of years of university education and deep interest in the
prehistory of humankind and so have an intuitive grasp (I think) of this
diet. Humans really never considered grains of any kind to be edible
until about 3500 years ago and the first manifestation of their use was
in beer, not bread.
 <BR><BR>
The more I research and interact on the web, the more I come to
understand that the state of our human digestive health is degrading.
The only reason we see less in the way of serious concern from the
health communities in countries in which rice is a staple is that if you
live in a country where you eat rice three times a day you cannot afford
to buy processed food. 
 <BR><BR>
I believe it is the combination of processing and high levels of complex
sugars which hurts so many people in the wealthy counties of the world.
 <BR><BR>
I deal with (for example) Chinese immigrants (many of them literally
rocket scientists) and many have never had processed foods or sugar and
they come here from the highest positions in their society and the most
populace country in the world.

<BR>Hope these thoughts help.

Hi everyone,
<P>I'm on the BARF email list, which is for those who feed Bones And Raw 
Food (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) instead of commercial pet food. 
 One of the goals of those of us who feed BARF is to educate other pet 
owners and vets about the health consequences of a lifetime of poor diet 
and the benefits of feeding a pet its natural diet. It can be just as 
difficult as it is to educate doctors and sometimes, fellow sufferers of 
UC and CD about the benefits of a diet that is actually so much closer 
to what we evolved on for millions of years. It can be no surprise to 
anyone who has read about the research on what humans ate for millions 
of years, and what homo sapiens ate for most of his existence, that a 
diet of grains and processed foods will not heal an injured gut. 
<P>An eminent pioneer in animal nutrition, Dr. Ian Billinghurst, who has 
written the superb books on diet, *Give Your Dog a Bone* and *Grow Your 
Pups With Bones* was asked by the wonderful woman who runs the BARF list 
for more empirical data.
<P>As we on this list were discussing the possible need for controlled 
studies, or even more empirical data to convince the medical 
establishment about the benefits of the SCD, I thought that Dr. 
Billinghurst's reply, which makes so many excellent points that apply to 
our situation, would interest many of you. He kindly gave me permission 
to post this, as he is also interested in human nutrition.

<P>Dr B writes:

<P>Unfortunately, masses of empirical data would lead to nothing more than
highly educated discussion which would lead nowhere. The only thing that
will impact on vets and fellow dog lovers is results. Give Your Dog a 
Bone
is written to be understood by twelve year olds and up.Grow Your Pups 
has
been aimed at 16 year olds and up. Why? So people would understand the
ideas as basic common sense and adopt them. I left out references and
footnotes which only serve to confuse. The only people who seem to
experience difficulty with the concepts in these books are my fellow  
vets
and other highly educated professionals who are blinded by a limited 
view
of medical science designed to test drugs and surgical procedures. They
have little knowledge about basic scientific philosophy, or sources of
knowledge in the real world. Unless we become as little children we 
cannot
enter the kingdom of BARF.
<P>Having said that let me also say that feeding dogs is not a religion 
where
all you require is faith. Raw feeding is based on hard science.
Evolutionary science and epidemiology. Unfortunately today's vet is 
totally
unaware of this. They have been kept ignorant for a very good reason. To
help perpetuate the sale of pet foods. Sadly this also perpetuates ill
health in our pets which of course keeps vets in business. Do realise 
that
all vets today are trained in companion animal nutrition by
representatives of the pet food comanies. They have absolutely no 
training
in the use of Biologically Appropriate Raw Food - BARF - in the feeding 
of
companion animals. This situation is akin to our medical doctors having
their nutrition courses run by reps from the major fast food companies.
<P>
If you want to discuss science with your vet and other educated
individuals, the whole discussion about BARF reduces to the 
UNDISPUTABLE
scientific fact that BARF is the evolutionary diet of dogs. Ask your vet
for the hard evidence that today's dog has a digestive physiology that 
has
shifted from both requiring and being able to handle a diet based on raw
whole animals, faeces, gut contents, fruits, nuts and berries - to a 
diet
based on cooked grain. There is not one trial to substantiate such an
hypothesis. There can be no doubt that BARF is what dogs require on the
basis of evolution. Their whole body screams for it. It is what they
require genetically. What their bodies were designed to use by long
evolution. Go to any zoo and see what the canids are fed. You can bet it
will not be a dry [or wet] cooked/grain based dog food. The success
achieved by the thousands of modern dog owners who feed BARF in some 
form
or another is testimony to the validity of this way of feeding. The
sickness seen in the dogs fed modern foods is testimony to the role 
modern
food plays in producing ill health. This is Epidemiology.
<P>Realise, processed foods were never tested against A DOG'S BIOLOGICALLY
APPROPRIATE DIET by the pet food companies. These products were simply
introduced and promoted by clever advertising. Since that time, all
research has been directed towards comparing processed food with 
processed
food, [between companies and between years] or the products have been
subject to analysis to determine if minimum [changing and limited]
standards are being met. Let me repeat, they have never been tested [by
the dog food companies]against a dog's gold standard diet. Its 
BIOLOGICALLY
APPROPRIATE RAW FOOD DIET - BARF. Of course lifetime feeding trials walk
through the doors of every practicing vet daily. However, there are none 
so blind as they who will not see.
<P>All we can do is be a shining light - an example - so that these people
may have the opportunity to be removed from their ignorance in the gentlest
way possible. You cannot bludgeon people from stubborn ignorance to
enlightenment. Masses of empirical data will make little impact on a mind
made up. All you can do is set an example. The observation of your
brilliant results together with your cheerful refusal to be pushed off your
path and your humble and yet consistent approach to what you do will go 
a long way towards turning the light on for such people.
<P>Change is occuring. Be patient, be examples and continue to learn
<P>All the best<P>Ian B.

I noticed that you have a page about Wolfgang Lutz on your web site.
You may be interested in knowing that a new English version of Lutz's
book about his low-carbohydrate diet has just been published.  The
details are:<BR><BR>
Title: Life Without Bread: How a Low-Carbohydrate Diet Can Save
     Your Life<BR>
Authors: Christian B. Allan, Ph.D. and Wolfgang Lutz, M.D.  (Allan's
     bio says he was a researcher at various academic and government
     labs, and now works for a biotech company).<BR>
Published by: Keats Publishing, Los Angeles, 2000<BR>
    (paperback, 240 pages, includes index and references).<BR>
ISBN: 0-658-00170-1<BR>
Price: US $16.95 (Canadian $24.95)<BR>
Available from Amazon.com.<BR><BR>
I have read the book and found it to be an interesting complement
to Elaine Gottschall's book -- it seems that while the two books
advocate similar approaches, each book has interesting information
that the other is missing.  (I've been on the SCD for a while, and
have recently started experimenting with a low-carbohydrate version
of the SCD.)<BR><BR>
This version of the book seems to contain pretty much the same
information as is in the chapter of his earlier book that appears on
scdiet.org.<BR><BR>
You may want to update your web page to note the availability of
this new edition.<BR>
I would also like to thank you and Mike for the wonderful work you
do in maintaining the scdiet.org web site.<BR><BR>
