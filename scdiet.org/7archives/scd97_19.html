Hello again,<BR>

There is a company called New England Cheesemaking Supply Co.,<BR>
http://www.cheesemaking.com.  I found this place when I was trying to locate<BR>
a strainer to make cheese from the yogurt.  They offer yogurt starters but I<BR>
haven't ordered any yet.  You can request a catalog at the web site or call<BR>
413-628-3808.<BR>

<BR>
As to the potatoe chip problem, have you ever tried plaintain chips?  My son<BR>
eats them and loves them.  Make sure they only contain plaintain and oil<BR>
though.<BR>

Dear folks:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is a message from Dietmar, in British Columbia.  Just wanted to let<BR>
you know that I'm scheduled for hip revision surgery plus other stuff, so I<BR>
anticipate (if all goes OK) to be off-line for several months (3 - 4).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So please note NOT to send e-mail ... you won't get a reply, and hopefully<BR>
you'll hereby know why.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you need to reach me for some strange &amp; urgent reason, you can try my<BR>
parents' phone @ (604) 536-6829; otherwise, I guess you'll know if/when I'm<BR>
back if/when you hear from me again!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                All the best, sincerely,<BR>

Since so many people keep asking &quot;where can I get yoghurt starter???&quot;, when<BR>
making a batch of y. yesterday, I saved the envelope so I could pass on the<BR>
mailing address of the manufacturer of the brand I use ... (but of course,<BR>
it, or similar starters, are probably available in ANY health food store<BR>
... I don't know why so many people have trouble finding any):<BR>

&gt;&gt;Lori<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I agree about not getting your hopes up about allergy testing.  I've been<BR>
&gt;there, done that, as they say.  I had a Vega test done by a Naturopath, which<BR>
&gt;uses a special machine, electric current and samples of about 25 different<BR>
&gt;allergens in little vials. And also an extensive blood allergy test called<BR>
IgG<BR>
&gt;IgE or something to that effect at another Naturopath. This one tested me for<BR>
&gt;about 200 different foods, spices, etc.  Both of these tests are supposed to<BR>
&gt;find allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities.  I've been to several NDs.<BR>
&gt;All the results of these allergy tests came out ambiguous and did not hold<BR>
&gt;true, which was really disappointing to me.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yep.  In my experience (about a dozen ND's) they're just &quot;wanna be&quot; MD's<BR>
except they charge you an arm &amp; a leg (for those readers in the US, here in<BR>
Canada our Medicare covers Medical doctors' services etc., but for<BR>
naturopaths we have to pay ourselves); I've never had satisfactory results<BR>
from them.  What more can be said?  If they DID have such fantastic<BR>
solutions, medical doctors wouldn't even exist anymore, is how I see it!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                Dietmar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; At the time, I thought that this<BR>
&gt;allergy thing WAS the answer.  The things I absolutely KNEW I was allergic to<BR>
&gt;because I get the early stages of anaphalaxis when I eat them, did not even<BR>
&gt;show up on these tests, so now I don't trust them.  When I questioned the<BR>
&gt;doctor about this, they said that these tests only test for so called &quot;hidden<BR>
&gt;allergies&quot; not the obvious ones.  I didn't buy that.   I don't know about the<BR>
&gt;skin scratch allergy tests that the MDs do.  I hear they are mainly good to<BR>
&gt;test for airborne things, or contact dermatitis type reaction allergens, and<BR>
&gt;not so good for foods, because foods are not introduced through the skin, but<BR>
&gt;rather, through the mucosa of the digestive tract.<BR>

&gt;&gt;On Elaine's diet you'll be eating lots of veggies and some fruits, plus<BR>

&gt;&gt;as &quot;Oops, screwed your head around once more, sorry, let's go on to the<BR>
&gt;&gt;next fad we can sell you!&quot;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I totally agree with Dietmar's excellent post in response to John's valid<BR>
&gt;concern.  We have been brainwashed in this society.  The industries do it<BR>
quite<BR>
&gt;easily, and the mainstream medical industries fall for it too.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I call it the &quot;Medical-Industrial Complex&quot; ... industrialized medicine, get<BR>
it?  (blatantly stolen from the 1960's &quot;Military-Industrial Complex&quot;<BR>
catch-phrase)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Especially the<BR>
&gt;Dieticians, whose schooling in my opinion is major brainwashing (sorry to<BR>
&gt;offend anyone out there who is one).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hey, offend, offend onward!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Back in the 1980's I spent one year at a university's nutrition dept<BR>
planning to become a dietician.  When I submitted a paper on &quot;Vit. A &amp;<BR>
possible colitis therapy&quot; (broaching the subject that diet &amp; colitis might,<BR>
wow, just might, be linked!  real eye-opener, eh?), I was &quot;slapped down&quot; so<BR>
harshly by my professor (a woman, just to be fair ... most dieticians are<BR>
women ... one of the minor reasons I wanted to get into the professions,<BR>
hey, I'm a full-blooded male, I won't deny!), and combined that with the<BR>
&quot;food sciences&quot; idiocy we were learning (basically, the chemistry secrets<BR>
of how to make industrial foods) that I decided &quot;screw these idiots, I<BR>
won't be able to get anywhere with my ideas here!&quot; and left that path.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So I've been &quot;inside the sanctum&quot; somewhat: go ahead, Anna, condemn!  It's<BR>
up to US to figure it out, since they're no help.   And those few<BR>
dieticians who've seen the light won't raise their head above the firing<BR>
line of their profession's &quot;political correctness&quot; because they'd lose<BR>
their cushy gov't jobs (most work in gov't institutions).  So there ya<BR>
goes!  We're on our own!  But that's ok, we're doing a great job, the way I<BR>
see it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The things most MDs and Dieticians<BR>
&gt;believe in are pounded it into their heads for years during the training.<BR>
Then<BR>
&gt;they become so closed minded, it's almost impossible to convince them of<BR>
&gt;anything else.  Tell any Dietician about our SCD and they'll tell you it's<BR>
just<BR>
&gt;plain wrong.  They don't want to hear an explanation or believe in anyone's<BR>
&gt;testimonial experience,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Because they're brainwashed to discount &quot;personal experience&quot; as<BR>
&quot;unscientific&quot; ... as if &quot;science&quot; isn't a totally subjective<BR>
value-judgement.  If it can't be fit into the square box of a<BR>
computerizable data base, it ain't no good, babe!  But hey, who can argue<BR>
with closed minds?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;because that is the extent of their brainwashing, so to<BR>
&gt;speak.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I just saw another exposee that told how they actually have no scientific<BR>
&gt;evidence that salt is bad for high blood pressure and heart disease.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hey, you good guys &amp; gals who have the time really should start to<BR>
subscribe to the Paleodiet list server from the same &quot;company&quot; we're now on<BR>
... don't quote me, but try &lt;paleodiet@maelstrom.stjohns.edu&gt;, but don't<BR>
ask me for advice because I've unhooked &amp; forgot the true details in<BR>
preparation for my hip surgery.  But the Paleodiet is a fantastic group to<BR>
&quot;eavesdrop&quot; / &quot;lurk&quot; around (if you're somewhat scientifically inclined and<BR>
can understand the ocasional big words ... it's a group designed for<BR>
scientists, NOT laypeople so keep your mouth shut unless you have<BR>
astounding insights that scientists would fall over themselves to listen<BR>
to).  These folks are not your standards scientificos, they're the<BR>
oopen-minded kind, really interesting stuff on there.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
OK, I'll make it easy for you .... two ways to check them out:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/paleodiet.html<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        or send &quot;subscribe paleodiet&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
in body of text to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        &lt;listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I think that'll do it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Ask<BR>
&gt;anyone you know and they'll tell you that too much salt is bad for you.<BR>
&gt;Apparently there is no real proof of this.  They actually have studies<BR>
proving<BR>
&gt;the opposite, that there's nothing really wrong with salt, and this idea<BR>
of the<BR>
&gt;badness of salt started in the 50's with a theory, a rumor and it stuck.  The<BR>
&gt;media is to blame for all this misinformation as well.  Think about how many<BR>
&gt;things in the past have been so publicized and thought to be true by the mass<BR>
&gt;population, and then later on were disproved and are now regarded as total<BR>
&gt;bunk.  An old saying goes that many of these ideas we think are &quot;the way it<BR>
&gt;is&quot;, will one day be accepted to be &quot;as old as sealing wax&quot;. (I think that<BR>
&gt;refers to the wax people used to use to seal letters, correct me if I'm<BR>
wrong)<BR>
&gt;meaning that at one time in history, everyone did it and thought it was<BR>
normal,<BR>
&gt;but now nobody does it anymore and wouldn't even consider it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Anyway, the point is, I think Dietmar was on the ball with his bit of advice.<BR>
&gt;If I were concerned about cholesterol (rightfully so, with all the media<BR>
about<BR>
&gt;it), I would take a cholesterol test now, before starting the diet, get a<BR>
&gt;baseline reading, and then go on the diet for a month.  Eat more fish and<BR>
&gt;poultry, less red meat; more egg whites, less yolks; more olive oil, less<BR>
&gt;butter, and more nuts, fruits, and vegies.  Notice I said &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot;,<BR>
&gt;not &quot;all&quot; or &quot;none&quot;.  There's nothing wrong with a little butter, but that<BR>
&gt;doesn't mean you can slather it on like there's no tomorrow.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I agree with you fully on all the above --- Dietmar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Another thing I remembered is the butter/margerine thing.  Remember how it<BR>
was<BR>
&gt;thought that margerine was healthier than butter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Geez ... you mean people actually BELIEVED that?  That an industrial &quot;food&quot;<BR>
could be better than the real thing?  I guess people forgot that margarine<BR>
(or &quot;oleomargarine&quot;, as it was first called, sounds nice &amp; greasy, eh?) was<BR>
invented during WWII as imitation butter so that butter oil could be used<BR>
to lubricate military equipment!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So we get the crap, and the tanks get the good stuff.  Tanks a lot, eh ;-)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Everyone was convinced.<BR>
&gt;Nobody would dare say they thought butter was ok.  But NOW, it has been<BR>
proven<BR>
&gt;that margerine is actually WAY WORSE for everyone than even butter!  Ever<BR>
hear<BR>
&gt;about Trans-fatty acids, hydrogenation, etc?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Paleodiet list again ... they've discussed &amp; discuss all these neat items.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Did you know that there are<BR>
&gt;actually regulations or laws now that prevent margerine advertisments from<BR>
&gt;claiming margerine is good for your health?  It's all because they proved<BR>
that<BR>
&gt;margerine is horrible for you!  Thank God margerine is not allowed on this<BR>
&gt;diet.  Although, I stopped eating margerine way before I found this diet.<BR>
&gt;Margerine was only invented during the war because there wasn't enough butter<BR>
&gt;to go around.  I'm too young to remember, but remember when you had to<BR>
squeeze<BR>
&gt;the food coloring in and mix it up yourself?  Gross!  When the war ended<BR>
there<BR>
&gt;was no reason to keep eating margerine, but the companies needed to keep<BR>
making<BR>
&gt;money so it became the &quot;healthier&quot; counterpart to butter.  Now we all know<BR>
&gt;different, don't we.  Not to mention that margerine is an oil usually<BR>
stored in<BR>
&gt;plastic (for those of you who read my plastic ramblings earlier).<BR>
Margerine is<BR>
&gt;probably worse than eating plastic.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Ok, you're starting to think I'm nuts again,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nope, I'm with ya!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;so I better go.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Stay, damsel, stay!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;That'll be all<BR>
&gt;for now.  Sorry to be so long.<BR>
&gt;Anna<BR>

Good work.  Excellent.<BR>

Hi there,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After completing my first month on the SCD diet, thought I'd send a note<BR>
to say hello, but especially to thank all of you for your kindness in<BR>
sharing info and experiences with the SCD diet. I am 28 years old, and<BR>
live in Raleigh, North Carolina.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The diet has been a huge help to me, even though it's only been one<BR>
month. I actually enjoy eating now. I have UC, was on prednisone for<BR>
approx 5 years, then recently switched to Imuran back in Jan. (I also<BR>
take Asacol, 12 tablets a day.) The good news is (under my doctor's<BR>
supervision) I tapered off the Imuran last Tuesday and am feeling great.<BR>
This is the first time I've been successfully off heavy meds in MANY<BR>
years. I believe the diet has a lot to do with my success.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Want to know a secret? You have to promise not to tell my in-laws yet. :)<BR>
My husband and I want to start a family! It is a very exciting time, but<BR>
also scary, in relation to having UC. My GI doc wanted me to consider<BR>
surgery first (j-pouch...removal of the entire colon), but after speaking<BR>
with a GI surgeon and a high-risk pregnancy OB, they both felt, for my<BR>
situation, I could try pregnancy first. I showed all three docs Elaine's<BR>
book. Two out of the three seemed optimistic in me trying it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Has anyone out there had experience with being on the diet while<BR>
pregnant? Do any of you have any thoughts or knowledge about whether the<BR>
diet is healthy for a pregnant woman? (Also, I'd love to converse with<BR>
anyone who has UC who has gone through pregnancy.)<BR>

<BR>
In closing, if you're in the Raleigh, NC. area, here's some locations of<BR>
where I found items related to the SCD diet:<BR>
- farmer cheese - Hannaford Grocery store (on Capital blvd.), and also<BR>
WellSpring Grocery store. (Make sure to ask for farmer's cheese. They had<BR>
no idea what dry curd cottage cheese was.)<BR>
- Plain yogurt (with only the ingredients Elaine mentions) - WellSpring<BR>
Grocery store<BR>
- Yogourmet starter (if you can tolerate this as some people on this list<BR>
mentioned they can) - WellSpring Grocery store<BR>
- Multi-vitamin (with no additives) - WellSpring Grocery Store (brand<BR>
name is Solgar)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Finally, I use a Salton yogurt maker which I ordered via the internet. It<BR>
works great. I now eat homeade yogurt on a daily basis.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you all well!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

At 06:06 PM 7/4/97 PST, you wrote:<BR>
&gt;&gt;Are the following forbidden on the diet?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Elaine has said kidney beans are allowed.<BR>
&gt;The rest of things you listed, I'm not positive about.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Why are garbanzos (chick peas) forbidden, but not white beans or lentils or<BR>
&gt;&gt;split peas?  What's the principle here?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;We don't really know why in a lot of cases.  One reason I have heard is that<BR>
&gt;Elaine didn't have a chance to &quot;test out&quot; every single food known to man and<BR>
&gt;she mainly went by what the Drs. Haas told her. After all, they apparently<BR>
&gt;invented it, not her.  She is no food scientist, and she didn't even have IBD<BR>
&gt;herself.  The amount of research and work done by her just to figure out<BR>
those<BR>
&gt;foods listed as allowable so far, was very extensive and labour intensive.  I<BR>
&gt;am greatful just for that alone.  I think that basically, that is the reason.<BR>
&gt;Maybe with more research, we could find out more foods we could possibly eat<BR>
&gt;and more answers as to why.  But who has time or resources for that kind of<BR>
&gt;project?  It seems the medical establishment couldn't care less about the<BR>
&gt;purported anecdotal evidence that this diet helps us.  I haven't seen anyone<BR>
&gt;rushing to do any studies, controlled trials, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There's no $$$ in it ... it's much more payback for the &quot;medical industrial<BR>
complex&quot; to sell drugs, use knives &amp; expensive equipment, and NEVER solve<BR>
the problem.  Stupid (for us), but true!  Go figure ... that's how life<BR>
works, eh?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It seems all anyone wants<BR>
&gt;to do is dis-prove it, rather than prove it unfortunately.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Why almond milk only after 6 months?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I found myself asking WHY to a LOT of things in this book.  Finally I gave up<BR>
&gt;and just accepted it, because usually, nobody knows why.  We can theorize,<BR>
but<BR>
&gt;then again, that's what this diet is all about.  A theory.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Right.  At some point (like when you're miserably sick and have found no<BR>
answers) and you hear about so many folks who've tried this and say it<BR>
works, even if in some cases not 100% but better than anything else that's<BR>
ever come down the pike, well, how about packing away your &quot;Doubting Thomas<BR>
why's?&quot; into the attic trunk for a while and just go with the program, see<BR>
how it works for you?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;constant why's&quot; types, well, hey, get the hell out of your own way and<BR>
get into gear ... brains don't help much in this case, eating by the plan<BR>
does!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We can discuss all the possible &quot;why's&quot; at a later date, first, let's get<BR>
well.  Does that make sense?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I think almond milk<BR>
&gt;probably contains concentrated forms of carbohydrates and therefore maybe<BR>
&gt;harder to digest.  Just like you're not supposed to eat nuts at all until the<BR>
&gt;diarreah is gone.  Not everyone realizes the fact that this diet is a gradual<BR>
&gt;process of introducing things.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Elaine's book is a little weak in some aspects, like making that<BR>
concept (of &quot;gradual introduction&quot;) amply clear.  But who ever said she<BR>
OUGHT to be an outstanding writer?  What counts at this stage is getting<BR>
the concepts &quot;out there&quot; among us, the great unwashed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It's not an all or nothing type of thing.  We<BR>
&gt;are supposed to start out with limited foods that are easier to digest,<BR>
and as<BR>
&gt;we get better, add a few more things, like the nuts, beans, etc.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Let's remember the name of this diet is &quot;Specific&quot; Carbohydrate Diet.  It<BR>
seems<BR>
&gt;that it's not necessarily a carbo free diet or even merely a low carbo diet.<BR>
&gt;For some reasons, mostly unknown at this time, certain carbohydrates are<BR>
easier<BR>
&gt;to digest for us than others.  That's probably why some beans are yes and<BR>
some<BR>
&gt;are no.  God only knows, as the saying goes.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Is there any way to communicate with Elaine directly to get authoritative<BR>
&gt;&gt;information about these kinds of details?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have heard that Elaine is actually very open to getting phone calls.  From<BR>
&gt;personal experience, I know she doesn't really like answering questions by<BR>
fax<BR>
&gt;because it takes too long to write it all out.  She is happy to answer all<BR>
your<BR>
&gt;questions on the phone.  I think her new number is 905-349-3443.  After<BR>
talking<BR>
&gt;to some people, I've heard that she sometimes even phones to check on how<BR>
they<BR>
&gt;are doing later on.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Good luck,<BR>
&gt;Anna<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;To:      Dr. Cordain and members of the Paleodiet Group<BR>
&gt;Re:     Answers to questions of May 26, 1997<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;=46irst, many apologies for taking so long to respond to your excellent<BR>
&gt;questions and comments of May 26.  Our replies follow:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1.  You now have the reference for Voegtlin=EDs book.  As you point out,<BR>
&gt;Voegtlin errs in asserting that plant foods are needed to prevent scurvy.<BR>
&gt;  Uncooked or minimally cooked flesh of organs of animals contain either<BR>
&gt;vitamin C or a vitamin-C-like substance that prevents scurvy.  Dr. Weston<BR>
&gt;Price made this discovery when studying the Indians of Northern Canada. (1)<BR>
&gt; When they killed an animal, the Indians immediately divided up the adrenal<BR>
&gt;glands and gave a piece--raw--to every member of the tribe, and they<BR>
&gt;understood that this would prevent scurvy.  Dr. Voegtlin is also wrong about<BR>
&gt;vitamin K, which is found in butter and animal fats.  So it can be said that<BR>
&gt;all the known vitamins, minerals and needed macronutrients can be obtained<BR>
&gt;from animal foods.  However, we should not  rule out the possibility that th=<BR>
&gt;e<BR>
&gt;various phyto-chemicals, alkaloids, etc. found in plant foods, while not<BR>
&gt;classified as vitamins, are necessary for optimal health, at least to some<BR>
&gt;individuals.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2.  We have consistently argued that the current high levels of CHD have<BR>
&gt;nothing to do with the consumption of saturated fat from animal sources,<BR>
&gt;(2,3,4) but rather are due to foods relatively new to the human<BR>
&gt;diet--particularly excess polyunsaturates, hydrogenated oils and refined<BR>
&gt;carbohydrates.  The anti-cholesterol, anti-animal-fat campaign is a phoney<BR>
&gt;issue invented and promulgated by the vegetable oil and fabricated food<BR>
&gt;industries during the 50s and 60s in order to get the upper hand in marketin=<BR>
&gt;g<BR>
&gt;their products.  It amounts to propaganda designed to denigrate nutritious<BR>
&gt;traditional foods so that the consumer will buy highly refined and processed<BR>
&gt;food items instead.  The amount of saturated fat in the American diet<BR>
&gt;remained the same between 1935 and 1974--the period of greatest increase in<BR>
&gt;heart disease.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;3.  The LDL/HDL issue is also phoney and does not stand up to rigorous<BR>
&gt;scrutiny.  LDL is necessary to carry cholesterol from the liver to the cells=<BR>
&gt;,<BR>
&gt;particularly to the brain cells, which unlike other cells in the human body,<BR>
&gt;do not manufacture  cholesterol.   However, it is true that oxidized LDL is =<BR>
&gt;a<BR>
&gt;problem, and does initiate foam cells in the arteries.  Oxidized cholesterol<BR>
&gt;is found in products that have been heated to very high temperatures in the<BR>
&gt;presence of oxygen, such as powdered eggs and milk.  Powdered eggs are added<BR>
&gt;to  many processed foods and powdered milk is added to 1% and 2% milk to giv=<BR>
&gt;e<BR>
&gt;it body.  People drinking reduced fat milk in order to =ECavoid heart diseas=<BR>
&gt;e=EE<BR>
&gt;are actually taking in large quantities of oxidized cholesterol which is a<BR>
&gt;causative factor.  You are also right in pointing out that high levels of<BR>
&gt;commercial polyunsaturated oils (virtually all of which have a high N6 to N3<BR>
&gt;ratio)  increase LDL oxidizability.   It is the excess of polyunsaturated<BR>
&gt;oils that cause the problem--not the saturated fats, whether in the modern<BR>
&gt;diet or in traditional cuisines.  In fact, SFAs have been shown to lower<BR>
&gt;Lp(a) which, unlike total serum cholesterol, HDL or LDL, is a very good<BR>
&gt;marker for increased risk of CHD. (5)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;4.  We believe that the amount of protein in the diet as related to CHD is<BR>
&gt;another phony issue.  One can point to populations with relatively high<BR>
&gt;protein consumption (30-40%) with little or no CHD, and to populations with<BR>
&gt;relatively low protein consumption (15-20%) with little or no CHD.  In any<BR>
&gt;event, we have no way of knowing the  exact ratios of macronutrients in the<BR>
&gt;Paleolithic diet, and in fact, there probably was a lot of variation<BR>
&gt;depending on season, locality and tribal custom.  The danger lies, as we<BR>
&gt;pointed out in our article, in diets high in animal protein but low in fat.<BR>
&gt; This seems to have been generally recognized by the hunter-gatherer.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;5.  We would like to know what kind of fat combined with carbohydrates<BR>
&gt;exacerbate the postprandial lipemic excursions.  We can well believe that<BR>
&gt;excess polyunsaturated or trans fats would do this.   We know that fats take=<BR>
&gt;n<BR>
&gt;with carbohydrates, especially traditional fats such as butter or any of the<BR>
&gt;tropical oils, lower the glycemic index, thereby preventing blood sugar<BR>
&gt;swings.  We are not aware of any studies showing carbohydrates were eaten<BR>
&gt;separately in  pre-industrial societies.  American Indians made pemmican fro=<BR>
&gt;m<BR>
&gt;meat or fish, fat, maple syrup and cranberries; succatash was made from meat=<BR>
&gt;,<BR>
&gt;fat, beans and corn.  Orthodox dieticians/nutritionists contend that high<BR>
&gt;carbohydrate diets  improve blood lipid profiles.  All this emphasis on<BR>
&gt;protein and carbohydrate content is, we believe, misplaced.  The real issue<BR>
&gt;is the kind and quality of the macronutrients--how they are produced,<BR>
&gt;processed and prepared.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;6.  We look forward to seeing your research and intriguing findings about th=<BR>
&gt;e<BR>
&gt;varying lengths of SFAs in wild and domesticated animals.  Stearic acid<BR>
&gt;(18:0) has been shown to raise cholesterol in some studies--and in any event=<BR>
&gt;,<BR>
&gt;the whole cholesterol issue is bogus.  There may be differences in the N6/N3<BR>
&gt;ratios in wild and domesticated ruminant adipose tissue, but in both overall<BR>
&gt;total PUFA is low.  The real imbalances come with modern farming methods (fo=<BR>
&gt;r<BR>
&gt;eggs, fish, vegetables, etc.) and with the introduction of high N6 oils into<BR>
&gt;the diet.  Excess N6/N3 ratios result in profound imbalances at the cellular<BR>
&gt;level that can  lead to MI, cancer and many other diseases. (6, 7)  We<BR>
&gt;certainly do agree that high levels of N6 in the diet are a problem, but the<BR>
&gt;source of excess N6 is not domesticated beef and lamb.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;7.  We do not know when milk product consumption became general, but it is<BR>
&gt;fair to assume that the  adoption of a nomadic/herder life-style--and<BR>
&gt;therefore the domestication of animals--preceded agriculture.  We cannot<BR>
&gt;understand how dairy products per se can be blamed for the CHD epidemic.<BR>
&gt; Counter examples include France (low CHD, high consumption of butter and<BR>
&gt;cheese); Soviet Georgia (famed for longevity, high consumption of whole milk<BR>
&gt;products); the Masai (high consumption of whole milk products, no CHD);<BR>
&gt;Switzerland and Austria (life span almost as long as Japan, diet rich in<BR>
&gt;butterfat and whole milk products) and America at the turn of the century<BR>
&gt;(diet loaded with butterfat and whole milk products, very little CHD.)    If<BR>
&gt;CHD is associated with milk consumption within individual countries, the<BR>
&gt;finger must be pointed at modern production methods (inappropriate feed for<BR>
&gt;the cows, cows bred to have a low butterfat content) processing<BR>
&gt;(pasteurization, homogenization) and additives (powdered skim milk containin=<BR>
&gt;g<BR>
&gt;oxidized cholesterol and synthetic vitamin D2 or D3.  Synthetic D2 has been<BR>
&gt;very conclusively shown to cause calcification of the soft tissues including<BR>
&gt;the arteries, and large amounts of synthetic D3, which has largely replaced<BR>
&gt;D2  as an additive to milk, have been implicated as a causative factor in th=<BR>
&gt;e<BR>
&gt;initiation of pathogenic lesion development in the arteries. (8)  The N6-N3<BR>
&gt;ratio of the small amounts of PUFAs in bovine milk fat is excellent--about<BR>
&gt;2/1--whereas total N6/N3 in the modern diet exceeds 20/1.  So once again,<BR>
&gt;while we agree that high levels of N6 in the diet are a problem, the source<BR>
&gt;of excess N6 is not butterfat.  Dietary saturated fats  contribute to<BR>
&gt;improved assimilation of EFAs. (9)  In other words, we need less of the EFAs<BR>
&gt;when there are enough SFAs in the diet.  Magnesium does seem to protect<BR>
&gt;against CHD.  The fault lies not with high levels of calcium from milk<BR>
&gt;products, but with the deficiency of magnesium in modern diets.  Weston Pric=<BR>
&gt;e<BR>
&gt;found that the diets of healthy =ECprimitives=EE contained ten times the amo=<BR>
&gt;unt<BR>
&gt;of calcium as the American diet of his day. (1)   Sources of magnesium<BR>
&gt;include nuts, meat and grains such as buckwheat.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;8.  As we stated earlier, modern man is not consuming high levels of SFAs<BR>
&gt;compared to pre-agricultural man.  The blame for inactivity should be placed<BR>
&gt;on  the lower nutrient content of the total diet, composed as it is of high<BR>
&gt;levels of refined and devitalized foods.  When the diet supplies all the<BR>
&gt;needed factors, humans need no incentives to exercise.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;9.  Finally, on the question of salt, a distinction must be made between<BR>
&gt;processed salt, which contains many problematic chemicals including<BR>
&gt;aluminium, and from which the magnesium salts and all the valuable trace<BR>
&gt;minerals have been removed.  Modern salt comes attached to modern food<BR>
&gt;products, which are invariably refined, rancid and laced with additives; and<BR>
&gt;it is difficult to separate salt from these other variables  in dietary<BR>
&gt;research surveys.  Some studies have shown that with low salt diets,<BR>
&gt;hypertension becomes worse.  In the 1930s, researcher McCance demonstrated<BR>
&gt;that when dietary salt is lowered, all manner of inappropriate physiological<BR>
&gt;responses ensue--including cramps, weakness, lassitude, loss of taste<BR>
&gt;sensation and severe cardiorespiratory distress on exertion.  (10) The recen=<BR>
&gt;t<BR>
&gt;contribution to this debate, describing various American Indian methods for<BR>
&gt;using salty blood in the preparation of their meat, supports our contention<BR>
&gt;that Paleolithic diets  contained sodium chloride.  Salty animal blood and<BR>
&gt;urine form an important part of the diet in salt-poor Africa.  The<BR>
&gt;concentration of population, and the rise and fall of civilizations<BR>
&gt;throughout the world, can be positively correlated with the availability of<BR>
&gt;salt. (11)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;To summarize, the hypothesis that modern chronic diseases like CHD and cance=<BR>
&gt;r<BR>
&gt;are due to consumption of saturated fats, red meat, milk products and salt<BR>
&gt;does not stand up to careful scrutiny.  These have been in the diets of<BR>
&gt;healthy population groups  for millennia.  Media denigration of such<BR>
&gt;traditional foods is a distraction that diverts the attention of both the<BR>
&gt;public and the scientific community from the real culprits--modern farming<BR>
&gt;techniques, inappropriate processing, refined carbohydrates, commercial<BR>
&gt;vegetable oils, food additives and rancid &amp; altered fats.<BR>

&gt;I agree about the fact that we don't know the whole story on fat and<BR>
&gt;cholesterol.  I also heard on the news the other day that aside from<BR>
&gt;advoiding animal fats, people who want to keep their cholesterol levels<BR>
&gt;under control should avoid sugar as well.<BR>
&gt;I think the key is that it's really only animal fats that have been<BR>
&gt;linked to higher cholesterol levels.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, let me just butt in here with my 2-bit's worth: the paleodiet group<BR>
(scientists), some have said it's actually a HIGH refined-CHO<BR>
(carbohydrate) diet that is the problem, whether one eats animal fats or not.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;So you should not be worried about<BR>
&gt;eating the other fats, like olive oil and the fats in nuts and fish.<BR>
&gt;And depending on your diet before, you may actually end up eating lower<BR>
&gt;fat content overall.  A lot of the foods that we have to avoid because<BR>
&gt;of their sugar or starch content, also have a lot of fat in them, like<BR>
&gt;donuts, cakes and chocolate bars.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, but it's all INDUSTRIALLY-SATURATED fats in that stuff.  Animal fats<BR>
are not INDUSTRIALLY saturated, and some aren't even saturated at all.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;As far as fiber goes, the diet is high in fiber once diarrhea is no<BR>
&gt;longer a problem and you can start introducing raw fruits and<BR>
&gt;vegetables, nuts and beans.  And I'm pretty sure that oat bran is not<BR>
&gt;the only soluble fiber that has been linked to lowering cholesterol.<BR>
&gt;Another source of soluble fiber is the part of a fruit other than it's<BR>
&gt;skin.<BR>
&gt;Also, exercise is a very successful way of controlling your cholesterol<BR>
&gt;level, as well as many other health benefits.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Whoever's interested, have a look at Barry Sears' book &quot;The Zone&quot; ... it'll<BR>
give you some ideas about all the cholesterol hype and B.S., and about fats<BR>
&amp; CHO in general.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But a note: I had to read some chapters of it 3 - 4 times to really &quot;get<BR>
the juice out of each morsel&quot;, because sometimes he writes a bit heavier<BR>
than a layperson or even non-dietician would understand ... but give it a<BR>
go anyway, if you're intersted.  Most any library will have it, I'm sure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;By the way, there were a few people on the diet who posted their pre and<BR>
&gt;post diet cholesterol levels and they had actually dropped.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Take care,<BR>
&gt;Tina<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>

        Thank you, Tina,<BR>

Hi, I didn't forget ya'll.  I went out of town for the fourth of July.  I<BR>
have to come to my Dad's to use his computer.  When I cook I cook by taste.<BR>
 I will try to supply receipes as I make them up.  Some of the receipes I<BR>
have just altered to fit the scd.<BR>
           Hamburger Pie  (Shepherds Pie)<BR>
Ingredients:  1 1/2 lbs ground beef<BR>
                  1 onion -- chopped<BR>
                  1 small bell pepper -- chopped<BR>
                  2-3 cloves garlic -- minced<BR>
                  24 oz. tomato juice<BR>
                  salt and pepper to taste<BR>
                  Frozen Peas, or string beans, or<BR>
                      fresh green beans if possible.<BR>
                  1 head cauliflower<BR>
                  1 stick unsalted butter<BR>
                  12 oz. sharp cheddar cheese ( you<BR>
                experiment with different kinds<BR>
                    and quatities of cheese)<BR>
Directions:  Brown ground beef, onion, bell pepper, and garlic.  ( If you<BR>
are concerned about the fat left in pan, you can brown meat in microwave.<BR>
Take a plastic colander and place in microwavable bowl.  Break meat apart<BR>
and place in colandar and microwave till brown, stirring occassionally.<BR>
The fat will drip into bowl and you can throw it away.)  Add tomato juice<BR>
and string beans (or peas or a mixture of the two) and cook on top of stove<BR>
till it thickens.  Add salt and pepper to taste.<BR>
        While the meat sauce is cooking you can cook the cauliflower till tender.<BR>
Drain cauliflower and then beat or blend in food processor.  Add buter and<BR>
salt and pepper and about 1/2 of the cheese.  (These are a variation of the<BR>
cauliflower potatos.<BR>
        Put meat in a casserole dish.  Top with cauliflower potatos and then top<BR>
with cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.<BR>
****Note:  I sometimes put mine in individual casserole dishes, bake and<BR>
then when they are cooled down. I freeze them.  This way I have something I<BR>
can take with me.  I just heat it up in a microwave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                Mayonaise (variation of Elaine's)<BR>
Ingredients:  1 jumbo egg<BR>
                  2 tablespoons of fresh squeezed<BR>
                        lemon juice<BR>
                  1 - 1 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard<BR>
                  1 - 1 1/4 cups oil<BR>
                  salt and pepper<BR>
                  1 tablespoon of honey<BR>
Directions:  put lemon juice and mustard and egg<BR>
                 in blender.  While the machine is<BR>
                 running pour the oilvery slowly.<BR>
                 It should take at least a minute.<BR>
                 As the mayonaise thickens, the<BR>
                 sound of the machine will change.<BR>
                *** It is very important to add the<BR>
                oil  very slowly in a fine stream.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                 Blue-Cheese Dressing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ingredients:  1- 1 1/2 cups of<BR>
mayonaise(homemade)<BR>
                  1 cup yoghurt (homemade - I make<BR>
                  mine with half and half)<BR>
                  6-10 oz. crumbled blue cheese<BR>
                  1-2 tsp. dry mustard<BR>
Directions:<BR>
                Combine all ingredients and keep refrigerated.<BR>
*** Note:  According to scd list you may have blue cheese occasionally.  I<BR>
take this with me when I know that I am going to eat a salad other than my<BR>
house.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
   I hope these receipes will help ya'll.  I have to go now, but I will try<BR>
to send ya'll a few more tomorrow.<BR>

<BR>
Hi everybody:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm trying the diet, even though I'm not the one with IBD, my adult son is.<BR>
I'm trying it to find out just how much trouble it is; I've been doing it<BR>
since June 5th.  My reaction:  the food's fine, the cooking's time<BR>
consuming if you don't just want to live on bananas and peanut butter or<BR>
some other quick food that you like and is Kosher on the scd.  And I'm in<BR>
Texas, where the fruits and veggies are plentiful and cheap, and my son's<BR>
in Sweden where this is not the case.  So I'm gathering all the lore, thank<BR>
you all for your fascinating info and the recipes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In particular regard to Karen's recipes, including mayonaise:  what about<BR>
the worry of using raw eggs?  A neighbor who sells us fresh yard eggs told<BR>
me the chickens have salmonella in the ovaries--some large percentage of<BR>
chickens in this country, at least.  My sister read in the paper that you<BR>
can zap raw eggs (OUT OF THE SHELL) in the microwave and kill samlmonella,<BR>
but she wasn't thinking of this diet and didn't notice for how long.  She's<BR>
going to call the paper; when I find out I'll get back to you.  Salmonella<BR>
is particularly dangerous for people suffering from IBD, I have heard.  I<BR>
might have heard it from this list, I don't know.  I have 3-ring binders<BR>
full of information, but I'm just beginning to organize it so I can<BR>
retrieve it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I made the carrot cake, it was perfect.  I make a lot of chicken soup.  I'm<BR>
making veggie soups, mashing it up in the food processor, and chilling it.<BR>
It's fine with a little fresh basil or something to snap it up; chilling<BR>
seems to diminish the flavor.  My neighbor's giving me tons of fresh<BR>
tomatoes, so I'm being good and not using canned.  I was very impressed<BR>
with Elaine writing on that particular issues.  I am eating canned<BR>
kippers--very tasty and very satisfying.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Holland wrote the following to the IBD list (Vol. 8, No.42):<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;. . . . why a diet with the most allergenic protein mix known to mankind<BR>
should work is beyond me.  The SCD diet people are not too bright. If they<BR>
tought about waht the immune response in an allergic response is compared<BR>
to what the response is in Crohn's they might say something halfway smart.<BR>
but there are no studies that even suggest that the scd diet is helpful.<BR>
There are problems that respond to parts of the diet, but those are well<BR>
known and are easier to tolderate than the scd diet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From my husband's experience I would caution against eating raw nuts on an<BR>
empty stomach-- he's gotten an extreme allergic reaction to that.  And I'd<BR>
say that nuts, even cooked, should be treated with caution, integrated into<BR>
a balanced diet.  In other words, I can see how it wouldn't be smart to go<BR>
nuts on nut muffins and cakes and what not and binge on them.   But it's<BR>
never good to binge on one food.  So does anyone else have any comments on<BR>
Dr. Holland's statment?  There's something in the Lutz article concerning<BR>
what might be the same thing--that the scd diet will triggger a reaction.<BR>
But what I don't understand is why the establishment doctors act as if the<BR>
medications they are prescribing are more benign than eating chicken and<BR>
steak and veggies and fruit and yogurt every day!  I'm happy Dr. Holland is<BR>
engaging in real dialogue with people suffering from IBD. I'm not taking<BR>
offence, I'm just puzzled about the vehemence of the reaction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope everybody is having a wonderful 4th of July weekend.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone else on the list have irritable bowel syndrome, or another kind of<BR>
 &quot;benign&quot; diagnosis doctors give after ruling out cancer, inflammatory<BR>
conditions, colitis, or Chron's? I had some success with the diet initially<BR>
but have had trouble sticking with it lately, in part because I tell myself<BR>
that since I haven't been diagnosed with a &quot;serious&quot; condition, it may not be<BR>
necessary to follow the SCD diet so strictly.   I know that the diet must be<BR>
an all-or-nothing commitment.   I've eliminated grains and sugar, but I've<BR>
been drinking not-so-weak coffee with milk-- the hardest habit to break. I<BR>
guess I need some more will power and more information.  The SCD book doesn't<BR>
have much to say about IBS.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My stools appear normal, but I often have a lot of gas with sharp pains and<BR>
pass large amounts of clear or white mucus, like egg whites.  Sometimes there<BR>
is blood in the mucus.  I only experience diarrhea on the first day of my<BR>
period.    I also feel extremely fatigued during flare-ups.  I have a feeling<BR>
that something more serious than IBS is going on.  The symptoms are definitely<BR>
getting in the way of work and school.  I'm pretty happy with my life<BR>
otherwise, so I don't think stress is a factor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm going to the doctor on Friday and am wondering what to say or questions to<BR>
ask to get something out of the visit--besides advice on cutting out the<BR>
coffee (which I can give myself).  The doctor recommended the Gottshall diet<BR>
but then said I could introduce some whole grains and other food to test my<BR>
tolerance.  I think she would not have advised this if she thought I had an<BR>
inflammatory condition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any advice on sorting through this and getting the best information or<BR>
treatment?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>

&gt;is blood in the mucus.  I only experience diarrhea on the first day of my<BR>
&gt;period.    I also feel extremely fatigued during flare-ups.  I have a feeling<BR>
&gt;that something more serious than IBS is going on.  The symptoms are<BR>
definitely<BR>
&gt;getting in the way of work and school.  I'm pretty happy with my life<BR>
&gt;otherwise, so I don't think stress is a factor.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm going to the doctor on Friday and am wondering what to say or<BR>
questions to<BR>
&gt;ask to get something out of the visit--besides advice on cutting out the<BR>
&gt;coffee (which I can give myself).  The doctor recommended the Gottshall diet<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hey, what kind of great MD do YOU have?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;but then said I could introduce some whole grains and other food to test my<BR>
&gt;tolerance.  I think she would not have advised this if she thought I had an<BR>
&gt;inflammatory condition.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Any advice on sorting through this and getting the best information or<BR>
&gt;treatment?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If you've read Elaine's book, you'll remember she says &quot;Try it fanatically<BR>
for a month and see your results&quot; ... esp. coffee with milk, that's worse<BR>
even than just plain coffee, I've heard from several sources (but don't ask<BR>
me to explain why because I don'tdrink it so I didn't pay attention to the<BR>
rationale).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Have a go at it ... you'll feel better overall, not just in your gut!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                Best wishes,<BR>

Hi Anna,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your response and telling me your experience with the allergy<BR>
testing.  I too am skeptical that the allergy tests will turn up<BR>
anything.  But I actually am glad you're telling me to really not get my<BR>
hopes up, so I won't get them up.  I hate when I get my hopes up and<BR>
then there's nothing conclusive.  I have had enough of vague responses<BR>
from health practitioners!  I'm going to do mine through the Meridian<BR>
lab in Washington state, a blood test.  Right now I am doing a process<BR>
of elimination thing, which is grueling because sometimes I don't get a<BR>
reaction for 72 hrs after I've eaten something.  Major drag.<BR>
  I want to ask you, what are the beginning signs of the anaphalaxis<BR>
thing, as you experience it?  I know what a full blown anaphalctic<BR>
reaction is, but I have a feeling I might have some tiny ones because my<BR>
face gets red and sometime my chest feels slightly tight for a few<BR>
minutes, could be like an asthma thing too.  I am trying to avoid foods<BR>
that do this, but it is painstaking work.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

&gt; I agree about not getting your hopes up about allergy testing.  I've been<BR>
&gt; there, done that, as they say.  I had a Vega test done by a Naturopath, which<BR>
&gt; uses a special machine, electric current and samples of about 25 different<BR>
&gt; allergens in little vials. And also an extensive blood allergy test called IgG<BR>
&gt; IgE or something to that effect at another Naturopath. This one tested me for<BR>
&gt; about 200 different foods, spices, etc.  Both of these tests are supposed to<BR>
&gt; find allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities.  I've been to several NDs.<BR>
&gt; All the results of these allergy tests came out ambiguous and did not hold<BR>
&gt; true, which was really disappointing to me.  At the time, I thought that this<BR>
&gt; allergy thing WAS the answer.  The things I absolutely KNEW I was allergic to<BR>
&gt; because I get the early stages of anaphalaxis when I eat them, did not even<BR>
&gt; show up on these tests, so now I don't trust them.  When I questioned the<BR>
&gt; doctor about this, they said that these tests only test for so called &quot;hidden<BR>
&gt; allergies&quot; not the obvious ones.  I didn't buy that.   I don't know about the<BR>
&gt; skin scratch allergy tests that the MDs do.  I hear they are mainly good to<BR>
&gt; test for airborne things, or contact dermatitis type reaction allergens, and<BR>
&gt; not so good for foods, because foods are not introduced through the skin, but<BR>
&gt; rather, through the mucosa of the digestive tract.<BR>

Hi Will,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, actually, I have found that I have an allergic response to the<BR>
regular cheddar and other hard cheeses like jack.  Also butter, which I<BR>
have used with great abundance since being on the diet!  I wish I could<BR>
tolerate the yogurt, but for me I always became too bloated after eating<BR>
it, so I never really have been using it.<BR>

Hi Lori,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That's great that you can now eat eggs.  Quite frankly, I don't<BR>
understand the whole allergy thing.  For instance, if we have an allergy<BR>
now, does it mean it's likely a life-long thing, and if not, what are<BR>
the factors.  These are the kinds of questions I find hard to get<BR>
answers to.  As for the allergy test, I'm going to do a blood test<BR>
through a lab in Washington state called Meridian.  My husband is an<BR>
acupuncturist and I can very fortunately do it through him.  Have you<BR>
had negative experiences have your docs take your allergies seriously?<BR>
Or is it, they just don't know what to do for them, so they hem and<BR>
haw?  I find that since my symptom are relatively &quot;subtle,&quot; (by docs<BR>
standards, not mine), I find I am treated as if I have psychosomatic<BR>
problems more than &quot;real&quot; ones.  It gets kind of old.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

&gt; Hi everybody:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I'm trying the diet, even though I'm not the one with IBD, my adult son<BR>
is.<BR>
&gt; I'm trying it to find out just how much trouble it is; I've been doing it<BR>
&gt; since June 5th.  My reaction:  the food's fine, the cooking's time<BR>
&gt; consuming if you don't just want to live on bananas and peanut butter or<BR>
&gt; some other quick food that you like and is Kosher on the scd.  And I'm in<BR>
&gt; Texas, where the fruits and veggies are plentiful and cheap, and my son's<BR>
&gt; in Sweden where this is not the case.  So I'm gathering all the lore,<BR>
thank<BR>
&gt; you all for your fascinating info and the recipes.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; In particular regard to Karen's recipes, including mayonaise:  what about<BR>
&gt; the worry of using raw eggs?  A neighbor who sells us fresh yard eggs<BR>
told<BR>
&gt; me the chickens have salmonella in the ovaries--some large percentage of<BR>
&gt; chickens in this country, at least.  My sister read in the paper that you<BR>
&gt; can zap raw eggs (OUT OF THE SHELL) in the microwave and kill<BR>
samlmonella,<BR>
&gt; but she wasn't thinking of this diet and didn't notice for how long.<BR>
She's<BR>
&gt; going to call the paper; when I find out I'll get back to you.<BR>
Salmonella<BR>
&gt; is particularly dangerous for people suffering from IBD, I have heard.  I<BR>
&gt; might have heard it from this list, I don't know.  I have 3-ring binders<BR>
&gt; full of information, but I'm just beginning to organize it so I can<BR>
&gt; retrieve it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I made the carrot cake, it was perfect.  I make a lot of chicken soup.<BR>
I'm<BR>
&gt; making veggie soups, mashing it up in the food processor, and chilling<BR>
it.<BR>
&gt; It's fine with a little fresh basil or something to snap it up; chilling<BR>
&gt; seems to diminish the flavor.  My neighbor's giving me tons of fresh<BR>
&gt; tomatoes, so I'm being good and not using canned.  I was very impressed<BR>
&gt; with Elaine writing on that particular issues.  I am eating canned<BR>
&gt; kippers--very tasty and very satisfying.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Dr. Holland wrote the following to the IBD list (Vol. 8, No.42):<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; &quot;. . . . why a diet with the most allergenic protein mix known to mankind<BR>
&gt; should work is beyond me.  The SCD diet people are not too bright. If<BR>
they<BR>
&gt; tought about waht the immune response in an allergic response is compared<BR>
&gt; to what the response is in Crohn's they might say something halfway<BR>
smart.<BR>
&gt; but there are no studies that even suggest that the scd diet is helpful.<BR>
&gt; There are problems that respond to parts of the diet, but those are well<BR>
&gt; known and are easier to tolderate than the scd diet.&quot;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;From my husband's experience I would caution against eating raw nuts on<BR>
an<BR>
&gt; empty stomach-- he's gotten an extreme allergic reaction to that.  And<BR>
I'd<BR>
&gt; say that nuts, even cooked, should be treated with caution, integrated<BR>
into<BR>
&gt; a balanced diet.  In other words, I can see how it wouldn't be smart to<BR>
go<BR>
&gt; nuts on nut muffins and cakes and what not and binge on them.   But it's<BR>
&gt; never good to binge on one food.  So does anyone else have any comments<BR>
on<BR>
&gt; Dr. Holland's statment?  There's something in the Lutz article concerning<BR>
&gt; what might be the same thing--that the scd diet will triggger a reaction.<BR>
&gt; But what I don't understand is why the establishment doctors act as if<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; medications they are prescribing are more benign than eating chicken and<BR>
&gt; steak and veggies and fruit and yogurt every day!  I'm happy Dr. Holland<BR>
is<BR>
&gt; engaging in real dialogue with people suffering from IBD. I'm not taking<BR>
&gt; offence, I'm just puzzled about the vehemence of the reaction.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Hope everybody is having a wonderful 4th of July weekend.<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I found an article on &quot;Current Medical Therapy for Inflamatory Bowel<BR>
Disease&quot; on the net lately<BR>
(Full text under: http://www.sma.org/smj/96jun2.htm).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Especially the part on &quot;Short-Chain Fatty Acids&quot; (see below) aroused my<BR>
interest. Does anyone of you know a brand name of such a medicament?<BR>
Pharmacists and doctors here haven`t heard of it at all.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Miroslav<BR>
Germany<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Short-Chain Fatty Acids<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, are the preferred<BR>
energy substrate for distal colonic epithelial cells. Decreased fecal<BR>
concentrations of SCFA have been shown to occur in patients with<BR>
ulcerative colitis but not Crohn's colitis. Table 3 summarizes clinical<BR>
studies on the use of SCFA enemas for active distal ulcerative colitis.<BR>
The clinical response rates of 56% to 90% are slightly lower than those<BR>
reported for hydrocortison or mesalamine enemas. The uniqueness of SCFA<BR>
therapy is that the presumed mechanism of action is feeding the colon<BR>
rather than altering its immune response. SCFA therapy given<BR>
concurrently with other agents might offer even more promise. In fact,<BR>
one small uncontrolled trial reported a 100% response rate using a<BR>
combination SCFA/5-ASA enema therapy in patients with previously<BR>
refractory distal ulcerative colitis.&quot;<BR>

Please remember that there is a big difference between an allergy and<BR>
an intolerance.  An allergy will give you a severe reaction -<BR>
sometimes put you in the hospital.  An intolerance is your body<BR>
reacting in some way (there are many forms) but not severe.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The real difference between the two is that an allergy they can test<BR>
for and find concrete results.  With an intolerance it is almost<BR>
impossible to pin point it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It has taken me almost 4 years to determine what my problem is.  I<BR>
have been to every type of doctor you can imagine except a ND.  None<BR>
of them had any encouraging words to offer me.  Basically I found<BR>
out through the process of elimination which foods were bothering me and<BR>
through reading as much information I can on related subjects in the<BR>
library and through the internet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I live in Canada so our whole medical system is quite different from<BR>
yours.  I hope you have an understanding doctor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good luck.<BR>

<BR>
Hi Denise,<BR>
Meridian Valley Labs in Kent, Washington is connected with the Tahoma Clinic<BR>
where I went to see Dr. Lamson.  He's an ND, who has a reputation for<BR>
successfully treating IBD.  My ex-boyfriend, who was also an ND told me to go<BR>
to Lamson.  I ended up with a lifetime refillable prescription for DHEA, and<BR>
I'm supposed to keep in touch with him via phone consultations.  The whole<BR>
thing was very pricey, and even a short phone call is $85 US.  I live in<BR>
Canada, so going down there was a big deal.  Whether or not the DHEA helped, I<BR>
still don't know.  Maybe it helped me get off prednisone, but maybe not.  I<BR>
can't tell.  I still take it on and off, in case it does do something.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I had a variety of lab tests done in that lab and the results were all pretty<BR>
much worthless.  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't really bother.  Instead, I<BR>
would have gotten this book by Ray Sahlien (not sure about the spelling) about<BR>
DHEA.  The book is excellent.  He interviews doctors all across North America<BR>
about their practices and experiences with this new and controversial<BR>
supplement.  It gives dosage recommendations and everything.  It's well worth<BR>
reading.  It reports the truth, not just the pretty picture of DHEA.  Like, the<BR>
fact that there is really no evidence of it helping certain diseases, etc.  I<BR>
got it at the library.  Anyway, the point behind this story is that the blood<BR>
allergy test there is the same as all the other tests I had there.  Costly, and<BR>
not very useful.  This is just my opinion.  If someone had told me that prior<BR>
to when I went there, I may have gone ahead anyway, but I just thought I'd give<BR>
my experience.  I do think the lab is good.  They do tests there that MDs don't<BR>
even know about.  Some of the tests were actually invented by Dr. Wright, the<BR>
Director of the Tahoma Clinic.  He has written several books as well.  Anyway,<BR>
if you think that this allergy thing is really the problem, then this blood<BR>
test is probably the best out of all the choices out there (in terms of allergy<BR>
testing).  I mean, it's probably better than Vega Testing, or MD scratch<BR>
testing. (It sounds like what you're getting is an IgG IgE test.)  But again, I<BR>
have my doubts because the results I got were so ambiguous with what I already<BR>
knew to be true.  And if I tried to live my life according to those results, it<BR>
would be very difficult if not impossible.  The results list like 200 foods,<BR>
spices, etc, and 1/2 of them I am supposively intolerant to on some level, so I<BR>
am supposed to rotate or eliminate them.  It's very complex to implement.  I<BR>
found that the SCD was easier to handle.  Doing both regiments at the same time<BR>
is hard.  I did try both.  The allergy results just didn't impress me.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To answer your question about the anaphalaxis symptoms, If I eat raw carrots,<BR>
kiwi fruit, avacado, or raw hazelnuts, I get the same reaction. The inside of<BR>
my mouth and throat gets all tingly and feels sort of burning and my throat<BR>
starts to tighten up.  Breathing is a little harder too.  My lips and mouth<BR>
swell a little.  The whole thing is VERY unpleasant and a bit scary at times.<BR>
These are signs of an allergic reaction, and if I continue to eat these foods,<BR>
I risk actually getting an actual anaphalactic shock reaction.  I have tempted<BR>
fate every now and then, like eating a little bite of one of those foods every<BR>
6 months or something, just to test it out.  When I get the same reaction<BR>
again, I know it is still true.  You see, allergies can come and go over the<BR>
years.  In a way, many times, people can DEVELOP allergies to things from<BR>
eating them too much.  This was the case for me with Kiwi, because I used to<BR>
eat just tons of them because my aunt grew them and every summer we'd eat them<BR>
every day.  Back then it didn't effect me, but then years later when I tried<BR>
one, I got the reaction.  With the other items I mentioned, I don't recall<BR>
eating too much of them, so these ones just developed for unknown reasons.  But<BR>
the point is, I didn't always have the allergy.  I used to eat avacados and<BR>
carrots with no problem.  Some of the reactions are milder than others.  Like,<BR>
avacado gives me a mild reaction, but if I drink anything with carrot juice for<BR>
example, it's very scary.  I simply avoid it completely because it IS so scary<BR>
when your throat starts to close up and you can't breathe.  I've never had to<BR>
go to the hospital for this though.  I just wait a while until it passes.  It<BR>
takes a few hours for it to go away.  The funny thing was, none of these foods<BR>
even showed up at all on my IgG IgE blood test results.  That's the main reason<BR>
I doubted them.<BR>
Hope this info helps in your quest for the answers.<BR>

Hi!  I just wanted to say something about the yogurt that we make and eat.<BR>
I tried to stop eating the yogurt and stick with everything else (a little<BR>
experiment you might say).  For me the yogurt helps me plenty.  Once I was<BR>
off of it there was no difference, but about one week later the big &quot;D&quot;<BR>
came back.  I waited it out for about three more weeks to see maybe it was<BR>
something else, only to be 100% sure.  Well needless to say I started with<BR>
the yogurt again on July 1, 1997 and the big &quot;D&quot; stopped two days later.<BR>
Well that is my story for the day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Hi everyone,<BR>

&gt;I found an article on &quot;Current Medical Therapy for Inflamatory Bowel<BR>

&gt;Especially the part on &quot;Short-Chain Fatty Acids&quot; (see below) aroused my<BR>

&gt;Pharmacists and doctors here haven`t heard of it at all.<BR>

Hi, Miroslav.  I've been trying to find out about this, too, without much<BR>
success (haven't had too much time).  I also came across a paper that said<BR>
they were studying aloe vera for SFA's.  SFA's (like butyric acid) are also<BR>
produced in a normally-functioning bowel from enzymes working on fibre.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;&quot;Short-Chain Fatty Acids<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, are the preferred<BR>
&gt;energy substrate for distal colonic epithelial cells. Decreased fecal<BR>
&gt;concentrations of SCFA have been shown to occur in patients with<BR>
&gt;ulcerative colitis but not Crohn's colitis. Table 3 summarizes clinical<BR>
&gt;studies on the use of SCFA enemas for active distal ulcerative colitis.<BR>
&gt;The clinical response rates of 56% to 90% are slightly lower than those<BR>
&gt;reported for hydrocortison or mesalamine enemas. The uniqueness of SCFA<BR>
&gt;therapy is that the presumed mechanism of action is feeding the colon<BR>
&gt;rather than altering its immune response. SCFA therapy given<BR>
&gt;concurrently with other agents might offer even more promise. In fact,<BR>
&gt;one small uncontrolled trial reported a 100% response rate using a<BR>
&gt;combination SCFA/5-ASA enema therapy in patients with previously<BR>
&gt;refractory distal ulcerative colitis.&quot;<BR>

Holy Cow, Kay, I missed that completely in &quot;Eat Right 4 Your Type ...&quot; ...<BR>
I know he says &quot;dairy&quot; but I figured yoghurt would be OK, and it DOES seem<BR>
to work OK for me now that I'm no longer adding milk powder to it as I was<BR>
doing for ages &amp; finally gave up in disgusting thinking &quot;This does NOT work<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
I'll have to re-think that, but as I said, when I was making &amp; eating &quot;milk<BR>
powder added&quot; yoghurt it was like drinking milk, like, &quot;forget it!&quot; major<BR>
problems; now, using just plain 3% regular milk, things seem quite fine.<BR>

&gt;Thanks for your response and telling me your experience with the allergy<BR>
&gt;testing.  I too am skeptical that the allergy tests will turn up<BR>

&gt;then there's nothing conclusive.  I have had enough of vague responses<BR>
&gt;from health practitioners!  I'm going to do mine through the Meridian<BR>
&gt;lab in Washington state, a blood test.  Right now I am doing a process<BR>
&gt;of elimination thing, which is grueling because sometimes I don't get a<BR>
&gt;reaction for 72 hrs after I've eaten something.  Major drag.<BR>
&gt;  I want to ask you, what are the beginning signs of the anaphalaxis<BR>
&gt;thing, as you experience it?  I know what a full blown anaphalctic<BR>
&gt;reaction is, but I have a feeling I might have some tiny ones because my<BR>
&gt;face gets red and sometime my chest feels slightly tight for a few<BR>
&gt;minutes, could be like an asthma thing too.<BR>

&gt;&gt; I agree about not getting your hopes up about allergy testing.  I've been<BR>
&gt;&gt; there, done that, as they say.  I had a Vega test done by a Naturopath,<BR>
which<BR>
&gt;&gt; uses a special machine, electric current and samples of about 25 different<BR>
&gt;&gt; allergens in little vials. And also an extensive blood allergy test<BR>
called IgG<BR>
&gt;&gt; IgE or something to that effect at another Naturopath. This one tested<BR>
me for<BR>
&gt;&gt; about 200 different foods, spices, etc.  Both of these tests are<BR>
supposed to<BR>
&gt;&gt; find allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities.  I've been to several NDs.<BR>
&gt;&gt; All the results of these allergy tests came out ambiguous and did not hold<BR>
&gt;&gt; true, which was really disappointing to me.  At the time, I thought that<BR>
this<BR>
&gt;&gt; allergy thing WAS the answer.  The things I absolutely KNEW I was<BR>
allergic to<BR>
&gt;&gt; because I get the early stages of anaphalaxis when I eat them, did not even<BR>
&gt;&gt; show up on these tests, so now I don't trust them.  When I questioned the<BR>
&gt;&gt; doctor about this, they said that these tests only test for so called<BR>
&quot;hidden<BR>
&gt;&gt; allergies&quot; not the obvious ones.  I didn't buy that.   I don't know<BR>
about the<BR>
&gt;&gt; skin scratch allergy tests that the MDs do.  I hear they are mainly good to<BR>
&gt;&gt; test for airborne things, or contact dermatitis type reaction allergens,<BR>
and<BR>
&gt;&gt; not so good for foods, because foods are not introduced through the<BR>
skin, but<BR>
&gt;&gt; rather, through the mucosa of the digestive tract.<BR>

        I have been making and eating yogurt using store bought plain yogurt as a<BR>
starter with no adverse results as far as I can tell. I did have one batch<BR>
that I had to dump, probably because I had kept the &quot;starter&quot; too long.<BR>
        Here is a question that has been on my mind for a few days: If the problem<BR>
with comercial yogurt is that the lactose has not been converted fully due<BR>
to the short time being processed, but it still is &quot;alive&quot; enough to be<BR>
used successfully as a starter, and even though it is kept refrigerated it<BR>
still remains active, (here's the question)  why can't comercial yogurt be<BR>
kept at 100-110 degrees f.  for 12-24 hrs. to &quot;finish off&quot; the lactose<BR>
conversion? Any ideas why this wouldn't work? Seems like a lot less trouble<BR>
and expense especially when I can only buy plain yogurt in quart<BR>
containers. Just wondering. seeya......bill<BR>

Regarding what Dietmar said below, this kind of thinking disturbs me. It's<BR>
too much like that of M.D.'s who prescribe their usual medicines but are<BR>
not willing to consider the SCD diet or other alternatives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Our diet is not a sacred religion, nor is Elaine either a Goddess or<BR>
infallible. Questioning and wanting more information on the diet's<BR>
mechanism's and principles, especially when one follows it and gets<BR>
great initial results but then deteriorates more so than the book says<BR>
will happen, is normal and desirable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm convinced I'm doing much better on the diet than I would be otherwise.<BR>
At the same time, I think we ought to be able to share our doubts and<BR>
concerns.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Changing topics, I too read Eating Right for your Type. The author says that<BR>
as a person with type AB blood I should be able to eat dairy products, which<BR>
I can. I was wondering if Denise and others who are not able to eat yoghurt<BR>
are the type the author says should avoid dairy: type O.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;  Right.  At some point (like when you're miserably sick and have found<BR>
&gt;no answers) and you hear about so many folks who've tried this and say it<BR>
&gt;works, even if in some cases not 100% but better than anything else that's<BR>
&gt;ever come down the pike, well, how about packing away your &quot;Doubting Thomas<BR>
&gt;why's?&quot; into the attic trunk for a while and just go with the program, see<BR>
&gt;how it works for you?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The &quot;constant why's&quot; types, well, hey, get the hell out of your own way and<BR>
&gt;get into gear ... brains don't help much in this case, eating by the plan<BR>
&gt;does!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;We can discuss all the possible &quot;why's&quot; at a later date, first, let's get<BR>
&gt;well.  Does that make sense?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trouble is even though we strictly follow the diet, and don't eat certain<BR>
foods until we're supposed to, not all of us continue to get well, so we<BR>
want to know what changes might help, get a better understanding of the<BR>
diet's principles. etc. Does *that* make sense?<BR>

&gt;Hi everyone!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I got the article by Wolfgang Lutz in the Munich Medical Journal lately<BR>
&gt;and I thought you might be interested in the abstract that is given in<BR>
&gt;English. In general the article states that a low (not particularly a<BR>
&gt;specific) carbohydrate diet helps most crohn`s and colitis sufferers<BR>
&gt;remarkably. Unfortunately the article does not contain any details about<BR>
&gt;the prescribed diet or forbidden foods.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;And I want to refer you to a website I came across which is a very<BR>
&gt;thorough collection of material about a possible cause of IBD:<BR>
&gt;Mycobacteria (paratubercolosis and avium).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Abstract:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&quot;Low-Carbohydrate Diet in Crohn's Disease:<BR>
&gt;A Low-Carbohydrate Diet (72 g/24 h) has a very favourable effect on<BR>
&gt;pa-tients with Crohn's disease. Symptoms and signs tend to subside after<BR>
&gt;6 months in 70, after one year in 80 and after 1 1/2 years in 90% of the<BR>
&gt;instances. Obviously there is no tendency of relapses, contrary to<BR>
&gt;ulcerative colitis which also reacts to this diet favourably. Since<BR>
&gt;nearly all gastrointestinal patients tend to accelerate the passage of<BR>
&gt;ingesta through their intestines, the idea arises that ingesta not fully<BR>
&gt;degraded are &quot;persorbed&quot; in the terminal ileum and cause allergic<BR>
&gt;reactions with granulomatous lesions typical for Crohn's disease.&quot;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I don`t write very often but I appreciate very much what everyone on the<BR>
&gt;list contributes. My experience is that we can only help ourselves<BR>
&gt;because most of the doctors know less than we do about our disease.<BR>
&gt;<BR>

<BR>
i have been following this group for a few months...i was drawn here<BR>
because of<BR>
the health problems i was experiencing with my intestines, etc. i modified<BR>
my diet<BR>
but at the time could not get enough info about the Diet to follow it. i<BR>
did start<BR>
eating more yogurt and less bread/carbos...but i was still dragging around<BR>
week<BR>
to week, day to day...no energy and lots of pain...<BR>
well, i moved to this new apartment three and a half weeks ago and i have<BR>
to tell<BR>
you all something...the pain is gone!! the energy is returning...i'm<BR>
starting to<BR>
feel more like Me again...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
i wonder, i just wonder....the other house had a terrible moisture<BR>
problem....i had<BR>
mold and mildew climbing up the walls in the bedroom and there was NO WAY<BR>
to get rid of it...i tried for 3 years...this new house is<BR>
dry...totally..with lots of sunlight<BR>
so that the mold and mildew won't even make an appearance.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is it possible that my body was reacting to the 'spores' in the air??? and<BR>
that's what<BR>
was causing an auto-immune response?? could it possibly be so??<BR>

        Dear Arlene,<BR>
                   Sure it is very possible, my sister -inlaw just called<BR>
me two weeks ago all excited that maybe she found a cure for me. ( I'm the<BR>
one with Behcets ) She ran into a friend who had been sick for years and<BR>
this women  found a doctor that put her on a diet similar to the SCD but<BR>
she is very allergic to mold spores. She only eats meat without additives,<BR>
she cannot leave fruit or vegetables out on the counter for even a short<BR>
while , ( since the doctor told her it develops spores in a very short<BR>
time. Well long story short , the regime this lady followed fixed all that<BR>
ails her.<BR>
        I wish it was so simple for myself, this diet has greatly helped my<BR>
colon.Now I need to find cures for the other parts of me that ail.<BR>
         My first flare of Behcets was at age 18 to 19 and a half , I am now 43.<BR>
Funny thing is that I went into a  controllable phase all the way up to age<BR>
39  is just co- incidence that I went on Doctor Atkins at age 19 and a half<BR>
.( I had packed on a few newly wed lbs ) His diet sure is similar to the<BR>
SCD.<BR>
        Sadly my hunt for a total cure is still on as I have neuro involvement, if<BR>
I could beat these headaches I would be singing from the hill tops. Also I<BR>
have a lot of muscle degeneration.<BR>
        A while back someone wrote about what Behcets is  it was a very misleading<BR>
and limited description. Here is my description of what Behcets is although<BR>
I will miss many symptoms , I think all will get the idea. I will list the<BR>
ones that seem to be shared by almost all in our Behcet's group. Plus some<BR>
shared by luckily a few ( Blindness)<BR>
                                           Mouth and genital cankers (<BR>
Mouth more frequent)<BR>
                                            Arthritis          ( unlike<BR>
what was written it does not take a<BR>
                                                                      long<BR>
time to develop , especially when aided<BR>
                                                                       by<BR>
large doses of pred. )<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                               Involvement of the entire digestive tract.<BR>
from the mouth right down to the rectum and vagina, Often mis diagnosed as<BR>
CD or UC. This also includes the sinuses.       ( this along with head<BR>
trouble was my first symptom bad enough to complain about)<BR>
                                 Neuro involvement     Migraines ,<BR>
peripheral neuropathy  over ninety percent of the people in our behcets<BR>
group which numbers 150 have a big problem with head troubles. MRI's show<BR>
white patches on the brain from the headaches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                           Skin rashes and photo sensitivity .<BR>
                           Only 25 % of United states patients respond to<BR>
the pin prick test.<BR>
                             Blindness , luckily in the US this also runs<BR>
at a low percent.<BR>
                              Fatigue and muscle degeneration<BR>
                             It can also attack the organ of it's choice<BR>
        Now here is an interesting tidbit Behcets people all seem to gain weight<BR>
in large amounts when put on steroids. All the people I know with CD still<BR>
seem to lose even when on large doses. So if you gain while on them think<BR>
about Behcets. ( That is only my personal observation)<BR>
                           I try very hard to get people on our Behcets<BR>
list  to try the Scd or variations of it . I would say the ten of us on the<BR>
list that use alternative methods and special diets are in the best shape.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Now here is what really bugged me on the post someone else wrote about<BR>
Behcets that it seems to run in ten year cycles. WRONG !!!!! Many in our<BR>
group have been suffering for 20 , 30 and even more years.  We have quite a<BR>
few teens with it also. Even some babies, it can strike a person at ANY<BR>
AGE.<BR>
        I have not covered all the symptoms but I hope it will give all of you a<BR>
bit of a clearer picture of just what Behcets is.<BR>
         I am so happy that you have found relief Arlene , I would suggest if you<BR>
think mold is a big problem for you that you keep your fruit and veggies in<BR>
the fridge and scrub them just before eating. I hope you still limit your<BR>
bread and other carbo intake. I lent my SCd diet book to a women in England<BR>
, but when I get it back I would gladly mail it to you.<BR>
                                                       Take Care,<BR>
                                                                     Kay<BR>

 Regarding what Dietmar said below, this kind of thinking disturbs me. It's<BR>
&gt; too much like that of M.D.'s who prescribe their usual medicines but are<BR>
&gt; not willing to consider the SCD diet or other alternatives.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
        Dear Tom ,<BR>
                    I could not agree with you more, We surly do not want<BR>
to become guilty of just what many  doctor's  are guilty of. Questions are<BR>
a good thing. We are each unique after all.<BR>
         I am sure that Dietmar did not  mean to sound so harsh, but we all need<BR>
to be careful about not judging another and being there to help not<BR>
criticize. I got beat up on this list for a question months ago and just<BR>
became a lurker for three months .      Example  sometimes it seems to me that<BR>
yogurt just becomes to much of a focus to people on this, I have absolutely<BR>
no trouble WITHOUT yogurt. I never liked the stuff anyway. But I don't mind<BR>
seeing all the discussion on it for it could be a key for someone else. But<BR>
one does not have to have it. I am proof of that.<BR>
        Also we have to keep in mind that some people have not had access to the<BR>
book , so we are all here to (gently) help them with their questions.<BR>
        I am home from camp today to do laundry so after my long post to Arlene I<BR>
need to wrap this up. But here is a little idea if a couple people have the<BR>
time maybe they could post  a Sunday through Sat sample menu of what they<BR>
eat in a week. I bet that would help the people who cannot access the book.<BR>
                                                         Take Care,<BR>
                                                                      Kay<BR>

        I have been making and eating yogurt using store bought plain yogurt as a<BR>
starter with no adverse results as far as I can tell. I did have one batch<BR>
that I had to dump, probably because I had kept the &quot;starter&quot; too long.<BR>
        Here is a question that has been on my mind for a few days: If the problem<BR>
with comercial yogurt is that the lactose has not been converted fully due<BR>
to the short time being processed, but it still is &quot;alive&quot; enough to be<BR>
used successfully as a starter, and even though it is kept refrigerated it<BR>
still remains active, (here's the question)  why can't comercial yogurt be<BR>
kept at 100-110 degrees f.  for 12-24 hrs. to &quot;finish off&quot; the lactose<BR>
conversion? Any ideas why this wouldn't work? Seems like a lot less trouble<BR>
and expense especially when I can only buy plain yogurt in quart<BR>
containers. Just wondering. seeya......bill<BR>

I would think, but don't quote me on it that once the yogurt is taken away<BR>
from the 100-110 degrees that the fermentation period is over.  Anybody<BR>
have any other ideas on this?<BR>

too much like that of M.D.'s who prescribe their usual medicines but are<BR>
not willing to consider the SCD diet or other alternatives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Our diet is not a sacred religion, nor is Elaine either a Goddess or<BR>
infallible. Questioning and wanting more information on the diet's<BR>
mechanism's and principles, especially when one follows it and gets<BR>
great initial results but then deteriorates more so than the book says<BR>
will happen, is normal and desirable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm convinced I'm doing much better on the diet than I would be otherwise.<BR>
At the same time, I think we ought to be able to share our doubts and<BR>
concerns.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Changing topics, I too read Eating Right for your Type. The author says that<BR>
as a person with type AB blood I should be able to eat dairy products, which<BR>
I can. I was wondering if Denise and others who are not able to eat yoghurt<BR>
are the type the author says should avoid dairy: type O.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;  Right.  At some point (like when you're miserably sick and have found<BR>
&gt;no answers) and you hear about so many folks who've tried this and say it<BR>
&gt;works, even if in some cases not 100% but better than anything else that's<BR>
&gt;ever come down the pike, well, how about packing away your &quot;Doubting Thomas<BR>
&gt;why's?&quot; into the attic trunk for a while and just go with the program, see<BR>
&gt;how it works for you?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The &quot;constant why's&quot; types, well, hey, get the hell out of your own way and<BR>
&gt;get into gear ... brains don't help much in this case, eating by the plan<BR>
&gt;does!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;We can discuss all the possible &quot;why's&quot; at a later date, first, let's get<BR>
&gt;well.  Does that make sense?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trouble is even though we strictly follow the diet, and don't eat certain<BR>
foods until we're supposed to, not all of us continue to get well, so we<BR>
want to know what changes might help, get a better understanding of the<BR>
diet's principles. etc. Does *that* make sense?<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Hi everyone!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I got the article by Wolfgang Lutz in the Munich Medical Journal lately<BR>
&gt;and I thought you might be interested in the abstract that is given in<BR>
&gt;English. In general the article states that a low (not particularly a<BR>
&gt;specific) carbohydrate diet helps most crohn`s and colitis sufferers<BR>
&gt;remarkably. Unfortunately the article does not contain any details about<BR>
&gt;the prescribed diet or forbidden foods.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;And I want to refer you to a website I came across which is a very<BR>
&gt;thorough collection of material about a possible cause of IBD:<BR>
&gt;Mycobacteria (paratubercolosis and avium).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Abstract:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&quot;Low-Carbohydrate Diet in Crohn's Disease:<BR>
&gt;A Low-Carbohydrate Diet (72 g/24 h) has a very favourable effect on<BR>
&gt;pa-tients with Crohn's disease. Symptoms and signs tend to subside after<BR>
&gt;6 months in 70, after one year in 80 and after 1 1/2 years in 90% of the<BR>
&gt;instances. Obviously there is no tendency of relapses, contrary to<BR>
&gt;ulcerative colitis which also reacts to this diet favourably. Since<BR>
&gt;nearly all gastrointestinal patients tend to accelerate the passage of<BR>
&gt;ingesta through their intestines, the idea arises that ingesta not fully<BR>
&gt;degraded are &quot;persorbed&quot; in the terminal ileum and cause allergic<BR>
&gt;reactions with granulomatous lesions typical for Crohn's disease.&quot;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I don`t write very often but I appreciate very much what everyone on the<BR>
&gt;list contributes. My experience is that we can only help ourselves<BR>
&gt;because most of the doctors know less than we do about our disease.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
