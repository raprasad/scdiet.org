Subject: Re: Elaine's diet<BR>
From: ShodanRT@aol.com,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Dear Anne, Your last words about being made to feel guilty at a presumption<BR>
that perhaps I think you haven't given it your all is exactly why in my<BR>
letter I said that I'm not making any kind of judgement, just asking. FYI,<BR>
following is my story of my intro to the diet. A patient at the dental office<BR>
I work at, told me about a radio program she'd heard with Elaine as the<BR>
guest. Knowing she cared about my health, I thanked her for the info, but<BR>
&quot;knew&quot; that no diet could ever help me. I let it drop, she brought
it up<BR>
again a few weeks later. I found myself annoyed that anyone could assume
that<BR>
I could be helped by a &quot;diet&quot; when my wonderful doctor could only
shake his<BR>
head and put me on prednisone. The next time the patient came in, she'd<BR>
written the name of the book on a piece of paper and said &quot;what have
you got<BR>
to lose?&quot; OK, so I bought the book. The night I read the book, I finished
it,<BR>
turned to my husband and said &quot;this diet would kill me&quot; &quot;no
way, I haven't<BR>
been able to digest a fruit or vegtable in years, let alone nuts or spices&quot;.<BR>
I'm not a religious person but here's what happened next. The phone rang
and<BR>
it was a cousin from another state. After a few words she said &quot;Rachel,
whats<BR>
wrong, you sound preoccupied?&quot; I proceeded to tell her about the dumb
book<BR>
I'd just read, again with the words &quot;this diet would kill me, or minimumly<BR>
cause me to lose my colon&quot; The words &quot;gluten free&quot; reminded
her that a freind<BR>
with crohns (who lived in yet another state) had been on a similar diet
with<BR>
remarkable results. She gave me the number of this person I'd never met,
I<BR>
called and listened to an incredible story of hope and of healing from a<BR>
person who, if at all possible was even sicker than me. Anne believe me,
I<BR>
know what feeling hopeless is like. For some reason (I'm not as intelectual<BR>
as some of us in this group and don't exactly understand the first part
of<BR>
the book which explains how the whole thing works) , the yogurt, made<BR>
according to the directions allows healing to take place. After a few weeks,<BR>
I found myself digesting those things that I never beleived possible. I
had<BR>
to take a leap of faith to start. You say that there are some things on
the<BR>
diet you won't touch. Have you made the yogurt? Please don't take offense
at<BR>
anything I've said. I've been where you are and my heart goes out to you.
If<BR>
you've eaten the yogurt (for at least a few weeks, daily) and have had no<BR>
relief, then perhaps you are one of those Elaine talks about not being able<BR>
to help and maybe science will one day soon be able to do for you what the<BR>
diet can't. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Again, sincere apologies
if<BR>
I seemed at all insensetive. Sincerely, Rachel<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Just had to back up your note to Meg and Matt. This diet is a challenging
one<BR>
and all who give it a go certainly deserve respect. I am having a much more<BR>
successful time of it with the realization that a very small slip up will
affect<BR>
me for about 5 days. That is hard to believe but for me it is true. I now<BR>
realize that if I am trying to figure out what is going wrong, I have to
think<BR>
back over the whole week, not just the previous 24 hours. <BR>

Good to hear your progress. I mentionned earlier that I like the idea of<BR>
gathering questions to ask Elaine. Thank you for offering to be the liason.<BR>
Perhaps these questions should be submitted under a specific subject, &quot;Questions<BR>
For Elaine&quot;, so you don't have to dig too far to find them. <BR>
<BR>
My question concerns fermented food. I have added sauerkraut to my diet.
I<BR>
don't like it, but I read that fermented foods such as yogurt, apple cider<BR>
vinegar, and sauerkraut add that very valuable lactobacillus acidophilus
to the<BR>
intestinal tract. Is sauerkraut legal? Does Elaine know anything else about<BR>
fermented foods?<BR>
<BR>
Michael,<BR>
<BR>
That was a huge dissertation that you provided. Wow. Must have taken hours.<BR>
What is your profession?<BR>
<BR>
Anne,<BR>
<BR>
I have no idea what permeability factors are, but here is the bread recipe
you<BR>
requested.<BR>
<BR>
Lois Lang's Luscious Bread<BR>
<BR>
2 1/2 cups blanched ground almonds (almond flour)<BR>
1/4 - 1/3 cup melted butter<BR>
1 cup dry curd cottage cheese (press down as you measure)<BR>
1 tsp baking soda<BR>
1/4 tsp salt<BR>
3 eggs<BR>
<BR>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (180 degrees C.)<BR>
Place eggs, melted butter, dry curd cottage cheese, baking soda, and salt
in<BR>
food processor using metal blade.<BR>
Process until the mixture is thick and resembles butter in texture. Add
almond<BR>
flour and process until mixed thoroughly. If the stiffness of the mixture
stops<BR>
the processor, remove the dough with wet hands and knead by hand until almond<BR>
flour is thoroughly mixed into other ingredients. <BR>
Grease a loaf pan (about 4&quot; x 8&quot;) generously with butter and coat
bottom with<BR>
ground almond flour.<BR>
Using wet hands, shape dough into a loaf shape and press into greased pan.<BR>
Bake at 350 - 375 degrees F. for about 1 hour until lightly browned on top.
<BR>
There will be a crack on the top of the loaf. Check by inserting a metal<BR>
kitchen knife; it will come out clean when bread is done.<BR>
Remove from oven and run a metal spatula around the sides of the pan pressing<BR>
gently against the loaf to loosen it at the corners and bottom of pan.<BR>
Remove bread from pan by inverting the pan onto a cake rack. <BR>
Allow to cool thoroughly before you cut it. Don't cut it while it is piping<BR>
hot. It needs to firm up its texture.<BR>
<BR>
Variations:<BR>
1. Add 1 Tblsp caraway seeds with the flour and you will get a bread that<BR>
resembles rye bread.<BR>
2. Add about 1/2 cup raisins and/or other dried fruit as a last step when
you<BR>
are kneading it into a loaf shape and you will have a tea loaf.<BR>
<BR>
(Recipe courtesy of Lois Lang)<BR>
<BR>
If you are unable to find the dry cottage cheese, use one cup of the drained<BR>
homemade yoghurt (described in the book as well as in the group recently.)<BR>

Subject: Permeability Factors<BR>
From: BERNINGER JOSEPH LLOYD,berninge@ucsub.Colorado.EDU,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Dear Russ (and everyone who is interested),<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your note. For those of you who were uncertain, Permeabilit<BR>
Factors are nutritional supplements that I take (for leaky gut and people<BR>
with IBD disorders.) Russ was interested and wanted to know where to<BR>
purchase these supplements.<BR>
<BR>
The company is called Tyler Encapsulations based in Oregon. Their<BR>
toll-free number is 1-800-869-9705. Russ, these are not<BR>
inexpensive...$16.00 for a bottle of 90 capsules. Well, expensive is a<BR>
relative term, I know. It's sure cheaper than a hospital stay, eh? The<BR>
recommended dosage is 6 capsules a day... which would be about 2 bottles<BR>
per month should you decided to stick to that dosage.<BR>
<BR>
If you or anyone would like more information on the contents, other<BR>
supplements, etc, I would be more than happy to share any knowledge that<BR>
I have.<BR>
<BR>
While, I'm here, I was wondering about a less than desirable topic. Does<BR>
anyone have an abundance of gas accumulation within an hour of eating<BR>
(I'm talking about allowable foods on the diet)? My system seem to be<BR>
unable to deal with eating solid food lately. In other words, I get so<BR>
bloated I look like I'm about 8 months pregnant compared to my otherwise<BR>
flat abdoment. It's very painful and frustrating, does anyone share this<BR>
burden, if so, do you have any recommendations about the cause, relief,<BR>
etc. I should mention that I have been in a flare for several weeks.<BR>
Thank you for any input.<BR>
<BR>
Peace, love, and healing,<BR>

Has anyone tried using spelt flour or does anyone know anything about <BR>
it. I don't see it listed on Elaine's list of no-no's but it isn't <BR>
listed as a yes either. I have been making bread from it and don't <BR>
think I am having any side effects. Since I am into a new flare up it <BR>
is kind of hard to tell. I'd appreciate the feedback.<BR>
Also, now that I have my updated list of members could someone who uses

Re: Questions for Elaine<BR>
<BR>
Hi Y'all,<BR>
<BR>
Hope you are all doing well! <BR>
<BR>
Per Christine's wonderful suggestions on grouping our questions for Elaine
and<BR>
her offer of being the &quot;liason&quot;, I've decided that I better sit
down and ask at<BR>
least a couple of the questions that I have personally wondered about.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, like many of us who have been on the diet for awhile, I wonder
about<BR>
items of food that are not mentioned in her book. I see over and over again
how<BR>
PLAINTAINS can be used as a substitute for potatoes. I've tried them a couple<BR>
times (deep fried they taste like real french fries, or at least, what I<BR>
REMEMBER them to taste like!!) without any noticeable consequences. But,
since<BR>
I'm still not 100% sure they are safe, I haven't started eating them regularly.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I'm curious about CASHEWS. While I know that only unroasted cashews
are<BR>
allowed, I still wonder if cashews that we roast ourselves would be safe.<BR>
<BR>
SWEETENERS: Generally, I use honey. However, in many stores, I've seen<BR>
&quot;Fructose&quot; or &quot;Glucose&quot; sweetener in the same section
where I find Saccharin.<BR>
Would it be ok to use these, assuming either is 100% glucose or fructose?<BR>
<BR>
Well, can't think of anything else right now!!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

Re: Coupla Recipes<BR>
<BR>
Hello, hello,<BR>
<BR>
There are a couple of recipes that I find myself making over and over. So,<BR>
figured I ought to share them . . . finally!<BR>
<BR>
First of all, I've not been a great fan of lentils. I kept trying new recipes,<BR>
though, and finally found one that I actually LOVE . . . probably because
the<BR>
lentils get pureed! <BR>
<BR>
The second recipe is one that I make and split up in several packages in
the<BR>
freezer for a quick meal as needed -- breaded chicken nuggets -- with a
salad.<BR>
<BR>
Bon Apetit!<BR>
<BR>
Deb<BR>
+++++++++++++++++++<BR>
Creamy Lentil Soup<BR>
<BR>
1 cup lentils (rinsed and soaked overnight)<BR>
1/2 quart water<BR>
1 quart homemade chicken stock<BR>
2 slices bacon<BR>
2 stalks celery<BR>
1/2 green pepper<BR>
1 yellow onion<BR>
salt<BR>
pepper<BR>
cayenne pepper <BR>
1/2 cup homemade yogurt<BR>
2 Tbsp. honey<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In pot, cook lentils, water and stock.<BR>
<BR>
Saute bacon, celery, pepper and onion (Make sure bacon is very crisp). Add
to<BR>
pot. Cook 1 hour.<BR>
<BR>
Put all of soup through food processor. Return to pot. Add salt, pepper
and<BR>
cayenne to taste.<BR>
<BR>
Add yogurt and honey.<BR>
<BR>
As a garnish, saute onion, chives and rosemary in butter. <BR>
<BR>
(This soup freezes well, too)<BR>
<BR>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>
<BR>
CRUNCHY ALMOND CHICKEN<BR>
<BR>
1 cup ground almonds<BR>
1 clove garlic, finely chopped<BR>
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger<BR>
1 teaspoon salt<BR>
1 teaspoon paprika<BR>
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<BR>
1/4 teaspoon pepper<BR>
2-3 pounds chicken, cut up (Note: I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts
and<BR>
cut them into small pieces, much the size of &quot;McNuggets&quot;)<BR>
1/3 cup butter<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mix almonds, garlic, ginger, salt, paprika, cumin and pepper. Dip chicken<BR>
pieces into butter; roll in almond mixture. Place chicken in ungreased baking<BR>
pan. Cook uncovered in 375* oven until thickest pieces are done, 45 to 60<BR>
minutes.<BR>

I'm able to find lots of sugar-free fruit products but they all contain<BR>

Hi Tim,<BR>
<BR>
I too wonder about pectin. There are several jellies made now with only<BR>
fruit but pectin is added. I think pectin is the fiber that is in fruit.<BR>
I wonder about Fructose. I have been using fructose for tea etc. I think<BR>
fructose is what is naturally in fruit. I hope these items are ok to be<BR>
eatting on this diet.<BR>
I wonder if anyone knows why yogurt made according to the book directions<BR>
would turn out runny. I have tried two electric yogurt makers and different<BR>
starters and it is always runny. What am I doing wrong?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for any help!<BR>

Anna:<BR>
<BR>
I have found that most fructose is made from corn, so it includes some long<BR>
chain starches. This is noted in Elaines book and I have heard it from a
public<BR>
health professional.<BR>
<BR>
Concerning the yogurt...I add about 1/2 cup of starter per quart as opposed
to<BR>
1/4 cup. This seems to help.<BR>

Hi Anna,<BR>
I've been having great success with yogurt. I've discovered that richer
milk<BR>
(4% rather than 2%) makes a thicker yogurt. If you like it really rich and<BR>
creamy, just pour in some table cream. I also add one envelope of Knox<BR>
unflavored gelatin, dissolved in water (1/4 cup) just before putting the<BR>
milk in the yogurt maker. Hope it turns out for you.<BR>

Subject: round robin<BR>
From: TRG,tguar@icom.ca,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Matt and Meg:<BR>
Welcome to the group. I also have UC and the diet has definitely helped
me<BR>
although I am not quite back to 100%. I started the diet in early April<BR>
because I had been having a bad flare for over 5 months and none of my<BR>
medications seemed to be working. I don't know what your symptoms are like<BR>
now, but I was having around 10 bowel movements a day with diarrhea,<BR>
bleeding and a feeling of urgency almost every time. I also had severe<BR>
lower back pain that seemed to be related to my colitis. I noticed<BR>
improvement within a few weeks. The first thing to go was the diarrhea,<BR>
then the back pain and then the urgency. The only remaining sypmtom is<BR>
occasional bleeding which although distressing doesn't interfere with my<BR>
life the way all the other symptoms did. And as I stay on the diet I go<BR>
longer and longer between days where bleeding is<BR>
present.<BR>
Also of note is that I am taking less medication than I have since my flare<BR>
up started in November. Which is a definte plus. So there's really nothing<BR>
else that can explain my success with the diet. I don't think it could be<BR>
placebo either because I was sure that the diet wouldn't work. I almost<BR>
didn't want it to because I thought I wouldn't be able to give up all the<BR>
foods that I loved. But I actually feel like I eat quite well. My craving<BR>
for the forbidden foods has gone. I haven't cheated and that is mostly due<BR>
to the reports from other people in this group of how much they suffer when<BR>
they do.<BR>
So, I guess I would have to reccommend giving this diet a try. It may sound<BR>
dramatic but this diet has given me my life back. I was so sick before that<BR>
I never wanted to leave my apartment (or my specifically, I guess, my<BR>
bathroom) Can't have much of a life when you never leave your home. Pretty<BR>
much everyone who the diet is going to help sees improvement rather quickly,<BR>
so just give it a one month trial like the book suggests and who knows,
you<BR>
may like it.<BR>
<BR>
Tim:<BR>
My understanding is that pectin is a form of fiber, which would make it
a<BR>
carbohydrate. Elaine does say in her book not to use pectin in making<BR>
jellies and jams, but I don't know if that means it is forbidden in general.<BR>
My understanding is that it is present naturally in many fruits so we<BR>
probably get some in our diet anyway. Maybe this can be one of the<BR>
questions that Christine gives to Elaine.<BR>
<BR>
Christine:<BR>
Aside from the question above about pectin. I would like to ask Elaine why<BR>
we can't eat canned vegetables even if the ingredients don't include<BR>
anything forbidden. Especially since we are allowed to eat canned fruit
and<BR>
fruit and vegetable juices.<BR>
<BR>

Subject: early success with SCD<BR>
From: William J. Ripple,ripplew@ccmail.orst.edu,Internet<BR>
<BR>
I started a modified SCD diet on July 5, 1996. I have two<BR>
major strictures in my ileum and cannot do hardly any<BR>
fiber. I also have crohns of the duodenum and stomach so I<BR>
need foods that are easy on this upper gi and low in fat,<BR>
low in spice, and low in acid. With all of these<BR>
restrictions I am not able to get as many calories as I<BR>
would like while on the SCD. This includes no sour homemade<BR>
yogurt or nut bread, lentils, etc.<BR>
Therefore, I have been doing the SCD with a liquid<BR>
supplement called Isosource standard from Sandoz. It is<BR>
fiber free, lactose free, sucrose free medical liquid<BR>
formula. Since starting this diet, I have been feeling<BR>
great. I noticed the improvements within several days of<BR>
being on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Within the next month, I am going to do another stool<BR>
culture to see if this diet is able to get rid off my<BR>
overgrowth of a gram negative bacteria that I have been<BR>
living with for a long time( Klebsella p.) I also want to<BR>
see if I can get my friendly flora counts up to a normal<BR>
level.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine told me that she knows of no one that has used the<BR>
SCD to help crohns of the duodenum. This is a rare type of<BR>
crohns and I may be the first one to report results of the<BR>
SCD from a stomach and duodenum perspective. I will keep you<BR>
posted but I am excited about these preliminary results.<BR>

Dear Anne, No apoligy needed, I know what it feels like, having been on
the<BR>
receiving end of &quot;if only you didn't take things to heart, maybe you
wouldn't<BR>
have these stomach problems&quot;. However, at the risk of renewing your
wrath, I<BR>
do think that without having tried at least the yogurt (per instructions),<BR>
you've not given yourself a fair shake at this diet. Nobody ever has time
to<BR>
do something they aren't inclined to and everybody always has the time to
do<BR>
something of real importance to them (there I go, preaching again). I have
a<BR>
full active life and making yogurt is not one of my favorite things to do,<BR>
but I'd find time for dialysis if I needed to &amp; to me this diet is a<BR>

Hi Anna,<BR>

It probably had to do with what you ate and when. not that you probably<BR>

should not be combined within a few hours of each other. Fit for life<BR>

From: K.G. Wade,fresh@coolerthanyou.com,Internet<BR>
<BR>
I was wondering if anyone was experimenting with fish-oil capsules. After
the study <BR>
done in Italy by Dr. Belluzzi (where people with moderate Crohn's were put
on 2.7 g of <BR>
fish-oil capsules a day; 60% taking fish-oil remained in remission, only
25% on <BR>
placebo did.) It seems rather encouraging.<BR>
My question about it is that the special coating that they used for the
<BR>
fish-oil capsules isn't available in the U.S. yet (why I don't know!). I
guess taking <BR>
2.7 grams of fish-oil is difficult to digest and makes people smell fishy.
Flax seed <BR>
oil is also an omega-3 fatty oil, metabolized slightly differently. There
are <BR>
controversies over which is actually more beneficial. As one can purchase
organic <BR>
flax-seed oil, therefore assuring the quality of the product, but there
is no way to <BR>
know about the fish oil regulations, as far as contamination goes, it seems
the flax <BR>
oil might be better. Also, one would bypass the problems with digestion
and fish-odor. <BR>
Does anyone know if both of these omega 3's are interchangeable?<BR>

Here are my questions for Elaine:<BR>
<BR>
1)What specifically is wrong with pectin?<BR>
<BR>
2)Why does one have to wait before drinking almond milk?<BR>
<BR>
3)Why is butter OK? <BR>
<BR>
4)Are beets allowed (I can't remember; my doctor has my book currently.)
<BR>
If they're not (I seem to remember something about beet sugar), then why
<BR>
not? Fruit has plently of sugar in it too.<BR>
<BR>
5)Like other people are wondering, what's wrong with pure fructose?<BR>
<BR>
6)What is the difference between red and white wine, dietwise? <BR>
Naturally, the yeast in the wine is one part of the answer, but why dry
<BR>
whites instead of reds, especially if grape juice itself is okay?<BR>
<BR>
That's all we can think of!!!<BR>

Anna,<BR>
how are your mixing your starter into the yoguhurt, my yoguhurt always<BR>
comes out like baked custard except the last time I made it, it came out<BR>
runny. there are two possible reasons for this,<BR>
<BR>
1. I used an electric mixer to mix the starter in , but I went up onto high<BR>
speed and the milk frothed up. This gave me a solid frothy top and a runny<BR>
bottom.<BR>
<BR>
2. The other reason is I have a thermometer in the Electric yogurt maker<BR>
which is set to 45-50 degress (unchangeable) this I know is much higher<BR>
than that recommended in the book, so I thought I might reduce the<BR>
temperature by leaving the lid ajar. Doing so actually increased the<BR>
temperaure. since the thermostate started working over time to compensate<BR>
for the heat being lost. the temperature rose to about 52.(celsius) Now<BR>
what may have happened is that the high temperature at the base of the jars<BR>
may have kiled off the bacteria leaving the yogurt unfermented at the<BR>
bottom. I'm going to try again with the lid on and just mix the yogurt into<BR>
the milk on low speed onthe blender.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this gives you some ideas . (suggest you get an accurate thermometer<BR>
if you haven't already got one and put it in the machine to test the<BR>
temperature. that way you can accurately monitor the temperature and know<BR>
if and when your machine needs a service.<BR>

Thanks Deb!<BR>
Those recipies look great.<BR>
<BR>
Here's a couple more from my kitchen. Enjoy!<BR>
<BR>
Sharon<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PANCAKES<BR>
Mix one cup almond flour, one teaspoon baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.<BR>
Set aside.<BR>
<BR>
Combine one beaten egg, 3/4 cup yogurt, and 1/6 cup oil. Stir this into
dry<BR>
ingredients only until moistened. <BR>
<BR>
Use a hot griddle or frying pan. Start with small size as they may be hard<BR>
to flip. Give them plenty of time to cook through. They will be beautifully<BR>
brown and taste great with honey, your homemade syrup, or just plain.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
SALAD DRESSING<BR>
Combine in blender: 1cup veg oil, 1/2 cup each of vinegar, honey and<BR>
homemade catsup, 1 teaspoon each salt and mustard, a dash of celery salt,
1<BR>
tablespoon dry onion flakes.<BR>
<BR>
FROZEN FRUIT SLUSH<BR>
Mix together in bowl: 1 6oz. can orange juice concentrate and 2 cans water,
<BR>
1 20 oz. can crushed, unsweetened pineapple, 6 or 7 bananas diced. Honey
to<BR>
flavor is optional. I fill individual cups, covering them with plastic wrap,<BR>
and freezing them. This is refreshing on these hot muggy days! <BR>

Hi Everybody,<BR>
<BR>
As ever our &quot;family&quot; is growing, a testament to the interest in
Elaine's <BR>
diet. I found Rachel's assurances of how the diet had changed her life <BR>
uplifting. It's great to know that it really works. I've been on the <BR>
diet 11 months now and I'm convinced that it does take time to get it <BR>
right for your body. For instance although all fruit is allowable I find
<BR>
that too much raw fruit in the mornings sets me off. Also grapes can be
<BR>
a problem for me. I thought I'd try them skinned. And the yogurt, I <BR>
can't get it right, when ever I try it I seem to have problems the next
day.<BR>
<BR>
Christine, Thank you for offering to co-ordinate questions to Elaine. A
<BR>
great idea. She is very giving of her time but I'm sure prefers to deal
<BR>
with one contact instead of many.<BR>
<BR>
Athena, Isn't the bloating something? Just like being pregnant again. <BR>
However since I cut down on raw fruit especially grapes I don't bloat <BR>
anywhere near as much.<BR>
<BR>
Tim, Pectin is a naturally occuring substance in fruits. It's what <BR>
makes jellies and jams set when they are boiled. It is present <BR>
especially in apples. So it should be okay for us. I have IBS and I <BR>
find apple sauce really good for my system.<BR>
<BR>
Anna, Fructose is a monosaccharide so its fine on the diet, BUT some <BR>
companies use the label fructose or glucose-fructose to mean corn syrup
<BR>
which is a disaccharide and not okay for us. I found that out the hard <BR>
way by drinking Snapple which I thought was okay. It took me a while to
<BR>
identify it because I did have some okay days even when I was drinking it.<BR>

From: Kelly Christine F.,C.Kelly@telesat.ca,Internet<BR>
<BR>
Has anyone found that they have had a problem with Candida or yeast <BR>
overgrowth and related it to their UC/Crohn's symptoms and treated it and
<BR>
got improvement with treating it?<BR>
<BR>
If so, what kind of other symptoms can you relate to the yeast <BR>
overgrowth, i.e. could the bloating after meals be related. Did you <BR>
treat it with medication, other natural products, and/or diet. How long
<BR>
did it take to go away and did it stay away?<BR>
<BR>
Has anyone experienced any of the long-term side effects of prednisone <BR>
use such as the bone density loss problem. If so, how long were you on <BR>
the prednisone and at what kind of dosages. They talk about exercise to
<BR>
help avoid these long term effects, does anyone know how much and how <BR>
often and what kind is the best?<BR>
<BR>
Is anyone out there on this diet and NOT on any medication? If so, how <BR>
long have you been without medication, how much medication were you on <BR>
before and what kinds, how severe were your symptoms prior to having <BR>
success with the diet and getting off medication?<BR>

You are the first person I have heard of that is battling an identified<BR>
micro-organism of long term duration. Also you mention getting your friendly<BR>
flora counts up to a good level. Who is able to do these tests for you?
I am<BR>
not actually going to do any of these tests, its just that in the frustrating<BR>
pre diet days there were no suggestions from the medical profession for
any of<BR>
these tests which seem to me to be such a good idea. It is a pleasure to
hear<BR>
that you are doing well. I am amazed that you can stick to such a severe<BR>
regiman and it encourages me to keep at it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Deb,<BR>
<BR>
Could you explain again how to send to more than 50 people? I know you already<BR>
told me. I saw Michael's step by step explanation but I think that must
be for<BR>
the Internet as I could not see how to do it with Compuserve. Also if this
info<BR>
can be accessed in a Forum I will look it up on my own. By the way, I saw
your<BR>
message in the &quot;IBD Sucks Big Time&quot; group. How much time do you
spend online?<BR>
More than you should, less than you'd like? Me too!!!<BR>
<BR>
To the person having trouble with bloating, I think it was Athena,<BR>
<BR>
For me that is a symptom of the disease in general. Bloating at night signals<BR>
misery the next day! Once I've gotten as far as bloating there doesn't seem
to<BR>
be anything I can do to stop things from getting worse. Just stick to the
diet<BR>
tenaciously and for dear life, and add in everything that might up your
friendly<BR>
flora level. The lactobacilllus acidophilus apparently gobble up obnoxious<BR>
microorganisms, hence speeding up the effect of the diet in general. Take
in<BR>
pill form, which I don't find very effective, or as yogurt, which I do find<BR>
very effective. Baby that yogurt along, use 18% table cream at least for
a try,<BR>
incubate as long as you can up to 48 hours for real richness, then refridgerate<BR>
for another few days if possible for a product that you can snack on all
day. I<BR>
really enjoy it, however if I ever get better, (and things are looking very<BR>
promising) then I will never eat yogurt again! I view it as Rachel does,
a<BR>
medicine.<BR>

Subject: Current List of Questions for Elai ne<BR>
From: Kelly Christine F.,C.Kelly@telesat.ca,Internet<BR>
<BR>
A final updated view of questions before I fax them out to Elaine. If <BR>
you don't see your individual question, I may have incorporated it in <BR>
with someone else's, otherwise sorry about that, make a note and we'll <BR>
catch it the next time.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, I was so happy to hear that someone has been on the diet for
<BR>
such a long period with such great success and is now even ready to <BR>
experiment! That's great!<BR>
<BR>
Chris<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
1) The following things have been questioned as to whether they are <BR>
allowed or not on the diet. Could you please comment.<BR>
pectin (naturally present in many fruits why is it not usable in jams, <BR>
jellies)<BR>
plaintain bananas and plaintain banana chips (no sugar added)<BR>
cashews roasted by oneself<BR>
fructose or glucose sweetener which is found with other sweeteners like
<BR>
saccharin<BR>
kidney, pink, red, pinto and other common beans<BR>
fresh fennel<BR>
<BR>
(fructose and pectin have been up for quite a bit of discussion so far <BR>
within the group)<BR>
<BR>
2) What could be the causes of extreme bloating shortly after eating? <BR>
Any ways to alleviate this? Any particular foods to avoid? Any <BR>
connection to yeast overgrowth problem?<BR>
<BR>
3) Question concerning fermented food. (I) have added sauerkraut to my <BR>
diet. (I ) don't like it, but I read that fermented foods such as yogurt,
<BR>
apple cider vinegar, and sauerkraut add that very valuable lactobacillus
<BR>
acidophilus to the intestinal tract. Is sauerkraut legal? Does Elaine <BR>
know anything else about fermented foods?<BR>
<BR>
4 ) I'd like to ask Elaine about Pentasa. What she thought of it and <BR>
whether we need to get off of it to make the diet truly &quot;successful&quot;.
If <BR>
we do get off of it what should we be taking instead?<BR>
<BR>
5) Someone told me that if you buy something called Beano and place it <BR>
3-4 drops on the first mouthful of gastric food, it helps to eliminate <BR>
the gas and helps you to digest. I'd really like to hear Elaine's <BR>
comments on Beano and whether it can be used in the soaking water instead
<BR>
of &quot;in vivo&quot; I know it's destroyed by heat but maybe it would
work in the <BR>
cold water. Elaine is not a big fan of 'in vivo' digestive enzymes, but
I <BR>
don't know why.<BR>
<BR>
6) Some direction on vitamins, minerals, supplements, <BR>
homeopathic/naturopathic remedies etc. Have seen people talking <BR>
about...omega-3 fatty acids, wheatgrass juice, flax seed oil, Cat's Claw,
<BR>
fish oil , evening primrose oil, folic acid, Biotin... There are so <BR>
many!<BR>
<BR>
7) Why are canned vegetables forbidden even if the ingredients don't <BR>
include anything forbidden, especially since canned fruit and vegetable
<BR>
juices are allowed.<BR>
<BR>
8) Why does one have to wait before drinking almond milk?<BR>
<BR>
9) Why is butter OK?<BR>
<BR>
10) Are beets allowed (I can't remember; my doctor has my book <BR>
currently.) If they're not (I seem to remember something about beet <BR>
sugar), then why not? Fruit has plently of sugar in it too.<BR>
<BR>
11) What is the difference between red and white wine, dietwise? <BR>
Naturally, the yeast in the wine is one part of the answer, but why dry
<BR>
whites instead of reds, especially if grape juice itself is okay?<BR>
<BR>
12) Is Lactaid 100 milk allowed on the SCD? I understand 100% of the <BR>
lactose has been removed. If so, can Lactaid 100 be used for a SCD <BR>
yogurt? Could this yogurt be cooked fewer hours so it would not be so <BR>
acidic and sour since the lactose has been removed? Would we need to use
<BR>
a lactose free starter? Are there any other SCD items that could be made
<BR>
from Lactaid 100?<BR>
<BR>
13) What is the premise behind the expected flare up at 2-3 months into
<BR>
the diet?<BR>
<BR>
14) Why are canned meats not allowed. Swanson brand canned turkey which
<BR>
contains only &quot;turkey, water and salt&quot;. Is the problem with them
what <BR>
might be added to them and not labelled?<BR>
<BR>
15) Why are canned tomato products not allowed? If I buy organic stewed
<BR>
tomatoes from the health food store, and there are no added ingredients
<BR>
(and I write the company, if I need to), are they okay?<BR>
<BR>
16) I don't know if anyone else did what I did, but on re-reading the <BR>
book, I realize that I didn't start out with the introductory part of the
<BR>
diet, I just leapt right in eating everything: beans, nuts, etc. that <BR>
probably should have waited a while, so: should I &quot;start all over&quot;
with a <BR>
week of the introductory diet and stop eating beans and nuts for awhile?
<BR>
(I've already seen slow, steady improvement in my 9 weeks on the diet the
<BR>
way I've done it).<BR>
<BR>
17) Is the problem with maple syrup the natural ingredients or in what <BR>
may be added?<BR>
<BR>
18) Are &quot;double sugars&quot; digested more easily then the polysaaccharides?
<BR>
Should one be reintroduced before the other?<BR>
<BR>
19) Once a person is symptom free, how much damage will an occasional <BR>
&quot;violation&quot; of the diet cause? For example, an eighteen year old
who <BR>
follows the diet strictly 95% of the time and is symptom free -- will <BR>
one forbidden meal per week undo the healing that has taken place? (Bet
<BR>
Elaine won't like this question!)<BR>
<BR>
20) Have many people with IBS been helped by this diet?<BR>
<BR>
21) Do you have any idea why this diet works for some with IBD and not <BR>
for others?<BR>
<BR>
22) Are most people who have success with the diet also able to maintain
<BR>
good health without medication?<BR>
<BR>
23) After being on the diet for 2 years (18 months symptom free!) how <BR>
should one go about introducing forbidden foods back into the diet. Are
<BR>
there some things that should be tried first? Should one thing be tried
<BR>
at a time?...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Elaine, a comment on behalf of everyone in the group, I'm sure!<BR>
<BR>
Do you know how much we appreciate your taking time to answer these<BR>
questions? Thank you!! Cheers!! Your helpfulness reaches a long way. <BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Firstly, I want to thank all who shared their success-so-far stories<BR>
regarding their UC conditions, it truly has been inspirational and<BR>
strengtening for me to read. Congratulations on your health and may it<BR>
continue to improve for all of you.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I truly appreciate the different ones who have shared in their<BR>
bloating problems. Naturally, I do not want anyone else to suffer this<BR>
misery; however, it's always comforting to know there are others out there<BR>
who can understand from similar experiences.<BR>
<BR>
I remember seeing a note regarding how yogurt has been more of a medicinal<BR>
daily consumption rather than for flavor and enjoyment. I have been<BR>
eating a lot of yogurt each day, as of late that's about all I can eat.<BR>
Anyway, one mentioned that the cream made yogurt was better for you than<BR>
the milk yogurt - is this true or did I read this wrong. I am reluctant<BR>
to eat anything with that much fat, but if it works I will try it!<BR>
<BR>
Also, does anyone have the recipe for Mac's lentils, I can't find it<BR>
anywhere and it looked good to try? Has anyone ever made a pie crust from<BR>
the almond flour? I was going to experiment with a yogurt quiche? If<BR>
anyone has any ideas on the flour and/or quiche, I would love to hear<BR>
them.<BR>
<BR>
A question regarding protein consumption. Does anyone have the formula<BR>
for daily protein requirements, that is, how many grams per pounds of<BR>
weight? Perhaps this would be a good question for Elaine!?<BR>
<BR>
Michael- your note regarding food combinations seems very interesting<BR>
about causing bloating. Lately when I eat anything, seems like I get<BR>
extensive bloating and gas, I also have had lots of nausea and overall<BR>
feeling of malaise. I will be optimistic and hope that this will be<BR>
cleared up within a week (a better time of the month for me.)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks all for your knowledge, stories and encouragement.<BR>
<BR>
Peace, love, and healing,<BR>

The questions look good to me. Did you get the ones from Ben? I am<BR>
interested in the answer to some of his questions as well. And I know the<BR>
answer to one of them. Butter is okay because it is 100% fat, which means<BR>
of course that it doesn't have any carbohydrates including the lactose that<BR>
is in milk.<BR>
<BR>
Debora:<BR>
Just in case you didn't see it above, I answered you question about butter.<BR>
It contains no carbohydrates.<BR>
<BR>
Ben:<BR>
I didn't do the introductory diet either. Well, I did try it for a few<BR>
days, but I found myself feeling very tired. And I found the food so<BR>
unappetizing that I gave up after a few days. It was a few months later<BR>
that I gave the diet a try again without the introductory week, although
I<BR>
did avoid things like nuts and beans as suggested in the book. The diet
has<BR>
definitely helped me so I don't know how necessary that part of it really<BR>
is. I will be interested to see what Elaine has to say about it.<BR>
<BR>
Anna:<BR>
I know a lot of people have already responded to your yogurt question but
I<BR>
thought I could give you some input as well. I'm not sure what you mean
by<BR>
runny. If it is just not the same as store bought, well neither is mine.<BR>
But if it is still more liquid than solid then it sounds like it is not<BR>
fermenting properly. Michael's suggestion about checking the temperature
is<BR>
a good idea. What I do with my yogurt, because it is kind of lumpy is give<BR>
it a few seconds in the blender. This tends to make it pretty runny. So,
I<BR>
strain it through a dish towel like Elaine suggests for making the yogurt<BR>
like cream cheese, but only for 2 hours and that makes it a good consistency.<BR>
About the gas that you experience right after eating. Did you not have this<BR>
problem before starting the diet? I heard that this is caused by swallowing<BR>
air while you eat, which some people have a tendency to do. To prevent<BR>
this, you are suppose to eat slower and make sure you don't talk while eating.<BR>
<BR>
Take care everyone,<BR>

Dear Athena, I've been using half and half for my yogurt for the last several<BR>
months. I really enjoy the rich taste and consistancy. I know I should,
but I<BR>
haven't thought much about the fat content. My last checkup (May) revealed<BR>
extremely normal levels of everything. I don't even seem to be anemic anymore<BR>
(first time in 9 years). Bloating does seem to be the one residual symtom
I<BR>
still get. Not as often or as uncomfortable, but it sure beats having the<BR>
blood or the runs. Sorry, I can't find the lentil recipe you're looking
for,<BR>
but keep plugging. I know some days are harder than others, but the healing<BR>
will come.<BR>
Dear Kevin, Congradulations! 2 years! I often wonder how I'll handle it
(I've<BR>
got 16 months). I keep thinking that I will keep my diet status quo and
eat<BR>
&quot;illegal foods&quot; occasionally but I wonder if that will work or
if I have to<BR>
introduce things slowly and let my body adjust to each new food. Babies
are<BR>
introduced to new foods in small amounts and one at a time, so I guess thats<BR>
the best way to go. In any case I'd guess your body will tell you which
foods<BR>
are OK &amp; which are no-nos. I wish you much success.<BR>
RE: stopping medications, Funny it should come up now because I've taken<BR>
myself off azulphadine as of about 3 weeks ago. I'd been on only a gram
a day<BR>
for over a year. My doctor wanted me on at least 2 grams and claimed that
the<BR>
amount I'd been taking wasn't doing much anyways, so I've nervously gone<BR>
off. I'm real squeemish about it and keep thinking maybe I'm beginning to<BR>
feel this or that, but I think its nerves. I'd been on the stuff 8 years.<BR>
I've promised myself that at the first sign of blood, I'll go back on. Its<BR>
very liberating somehow, not to be chained to &quot;a daily dose&quot;,
but scary too.<BR>
Love to all, Rachel<BR>

the milk yogurt - is this true or did I read this wrong. I am reluctant<BR>
to eat anything with that much fat, but if it works I will try it!&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I am the one who uses table cream to make yogurt. I can't say that it is
better<BR>
for a person then using regular milk to make the yogurt. A person must consider<BR>
the very high fat content and the excessive cost. For me, it is definitely<BR>
better as I am struggling to stay above 130 lbs on a 5'8&quot; frame. Also,
I really<BR>
hate the yogurt made from milk and would have to force myself to eat it.
The<BR>
cream yogurt is palatable to me and seems less acidic as well. Each person<BR>
would have to consider the high fat content before eating it on a regular
basis.<BR>
I think a chat with your doctor and maybe a baseline cholesterol test would
be<BR>
reasonable before using this kind of yogurt regularly.<BR>
<BR>
I can't agree with you more how encouraging it is to hear other people's
success<BR>
stories. My doctor believes in rallying the immune system in whatever way<BR>
possible, be it laughter, exercise, or encouragement from a support group.
It's<BR>
not known why some people's immune systems give out on them allowing these<BR>
diseases to take over, but there is some indication that a strong social
support<BR>
system and maintaining a positive attitude can contribute to the cure. Dr.<BR>

Here is Mac's Lentil ideas:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt;...It all started with Elaine's sweet and sour lentils and then
I got<BR>
creative--first modification was to substitute balsamic vinegar and fresh
sweet<BR>
basil in her original recipe. The next version included one seeded and diced<BR>
jalapeno pepper, small sweet yellow onion and balsamic vinegar instead of
the<BR>
original seasonings as listed in the book...&gt;&gt;<BR>

Thank you Sharon for the pancake recipe (can't wait to try it!) and everyone<BR>

Here is one for &quot;Sherbet&quot; that is quite easy and refreshing. I
suppose any<BR>
fruit could be used.<BR>
<BR>
Peach yogurt Sherbet<BR>
<BR>
1 pound (4 or 5) ripe peaches, yields about 2 cups prepared fruit <BR>
1 small medium ripe banana<BR>
1 cup plain, low fat yogurt (I used my very rich fat filled yogurt instead)<BR>
2-3 Tblsp honey<BR>
2 tsp vanilla extract<BR>
<BR>
Blanch the peaches in boiling water for 20 seconds. Refresh under cold water<BR>
and remove the skins. Remove the pits and slice. Peel and slice the banana.<BR>
Freeze the fruit in plastic bags. (I chopped the fruit up first before<BR>
freezing) When frozen solid, remove from the freezer and pound to break
into<BR>
chunks. ( I found no need to pound, it simply broke into pieces in a few<BR>
minutes.)<BR>
Place the yogurt, honey, and vanilla in a food processor. Add the frozen
fruit.<BR>
Using the pulse action, process until the fruit is mashed. Then turn on
the<BR>
processor and blend until you have a smooth puree. Serve as is or return
to the<BR>
freezer. It will keep several weeks in the freezer. <BR>

First, I wanted to say, that if any &quot;new&quot; people want to send
a message, they<BR>
can send it to me or another &quot;old&quot; member and we can forward it
to the rest.<BR>
I'm no longer giving new members our list of group addresses, I'm just giving<BR>
the info on subscribing to the listserver -- which still isn't working,
by the<BR>
way -- so in the meantime, we are continuing on, business as usual. Since
in<BR>
the past, with each new person, it took awhile for them to figure how to
CC<BR>
and/or add all the addresses, that I was forwarding for them anyway, that
I<BR>
figured that during this period when we are waiting for the listserver to
kick<BR>
in -- still hasn't, by the way! -- I would just forward as necessary. (Hope
I<BR>
haven't confused anyone!!)<BR>

Hi Ann,<BR>
<BR>
All is well (according to the garage) with my car, and, thankfully, this
time it<BR>
was still under the warranty . . . my luck she is a changing!<BR>
<BR>
You wrote the following:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; What vedetables<BR>
did you introduce first and how soon and how thoroughly cooked? How soon
was<BR>
it before you could eat various vegetables: lettuce? cooked peas, etc. How<BR>
about fruit? hat did you try first with success? How long would you say
all<BR>
this &quot;going slowly&quot; tookp--about 3 months? 6 months?&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
In the beginning of the diet, the only vegetables I ate were thoroughly
cooked.<BR>
I didn't try peas until a couple months ago because I was afraid of them
(had<BR>
always associated them with flares) . . . so that's about half a year on
the<BR>
diet. I probably could have introduced them earlier.<BR>
<BR>
The veggies I DID eat were well-cooked cauliflower, baked butternut squash,<BR>
cooked zucchini (not alot of this one, though, since I personally don't
like<BR>
it), baked acorn squash . . . can you tell that I began the diet in the
fall??<BR>
Thing is, even though I included these in my diet, I wasn't eating as much
of<BR>
vegetables overall as compared with eating cheese, meat, homemade yogurt,
and<BR>
eggs during the first two months or so. I ate fruits like cooked apples
and<BR>
canned peaches and pineapples (canned in their own juices). During the second<BR>
month I was on the diet, I began to get more eager to have more variety.
That's<BR>
when I added muffins made from ground almonds and started eating more cooked<BR>
vegetables. I began buying bags of frozen veggies and making them for dinner<BR>
regularly. <BR>
<BR>
The main course that I followed was that I was on the bare minimum of WORK
and<BR>
PREPARATION at the beginning of the diet, because, obviously, I was the
sickest.<BR>
As I felt better, I began making soups or casseroles on my &quot;cooking
day&quot; (when<BR>
my husband was helping me) along with my yogurt and muffins. As the months
went<BR>
on, I was not needing my husband's help (I no longer needed to &quot;rest&quot;
between<BR>
standing at the counter preparing things) and I have been making peanut
butter<BR>
cookies (I add a little bit of ground almonds in the recipe for some texture),<BR>
too. I try to continue to regularly cook and bake large quantities of foods<BR>
that I can freeze for lunches and quick meals.<BR>
<BR>
I don't think that any one person can follow the exact time frame for following<BR>
this diet that anyone else has done. It is basically a trial and error diet,<BR>
starting slowly and when &quot;stabilized&quot; adding the next, and often
backtracking<BR>
until you find the right path for YOU!<BR>
<BR>
By the way, I wanted to tell everyone about my trip this past couple days.
. .<BR>
at the last minute, I had to follow my van to the dealer's garage, which
is an<BR>
hour away from my home. Luckily, it is near my brother-in-law's house, so
I<BR>
(with my three kids) stayed at his house for the three days that it took
the<BR>
garage to work on the van. Thing is, I wasn't prepared in any way for taking
a<BR>
trip and while I'm at home, I usually have the proper ingredients, supplies
and<BR>
recipes to make SCD safe foods. When I eat out or over people's houses,
I stick<BR>
to meat, cheese, fruit and vegetables, which I KNOW are safe. This limits
my<BR>
calories, and I feel hungrier than usual. So, my choices are to eat safe
and<BR>
feel hungry, or feel full and be sick. Of course, I chose to stay well!
I did<BR>
have to cut my &quot;vacation&quot; short, though, and leave there so I
could come home<BR>
and have some yogurt and muffins and soup and cookies! (I got hungry just<BR>
thinking about the foods at home!!)<BR>
<BR>
What is especially hard when staying unexpectedly at someone else's home
is that<BR>
(of course) their eating habits are different than mine and even the simplest
of<BR>
meals (&quot;let's have a quick sandwich&quot;) turn into ordeals. I did
manage to get to<BR>
the grocery store with my sister-in-law to add more fruit, cheese and vegetables<BR>
to her supplies, so by the second day, I had more choices. <BR>
<BR>
Usually, when I'm visiting, I have my husband to help me to get to the proper<BR>
foods -- he makes sure that I eat right and not to please others -- but
he's<BR>
gone to Germany for six weeks (one more stress to deal with!). But I think
I<BR>
did a pretty good job of protecting myself. <BR>
<BR>
Hope you all are doing well!<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Deb<BR>

<BR>
Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Firstly, I want to thank all who shared their success-so-far stories<BR>
regarding their UC conditions, it truly has been inspirational and<BR>
strengtening for me to read. Congratulations on your health and may it<BR>
continue to improve for all of you.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I truly appreciate the different ones who have shared in their<BR>
bloating problems. Naturally, I do not want anyone else to suffer this<BR>
misery; however, it's always comforting to know there are others out there<BR>
who can understand from similar experiences.<BR>
<BR>
I remember seeing a note regarding how yogurt has been more of a medicinal<BR>
daily consumption rather than for flavor and enjoyment. I have been<BR>
eating a lot of yogurt each day, as of late that's about all I can eat.<BR>
Anyway, one mentioned that the cream made yogurt was better for you than<BR>
the milk yogurt - is this true or did I read this wrong. I am reluctant<BR>
to eat anything with that much fat, but if it works I will try it!<BR>
<BR>
Also, does anyone have the recipe for Mac's lentils, I can't find it<BR>
anywhere and it looked good to try? Has anyone ever made a pie crust from<BR>
the almond flour? I was going to experiment with a yogurt quiche? If<BR>
anyone has any ideas on the flour and/or quiche, I would love to hear<BR>
them.<BR>
<BR>
A question regarding protein consumption. Does anyone have the formula<BR>
for daily protein requirements, that is, how many grams per pounds of<BR>
weight? Perhaps this would be a good question for Elaine!?<BR>
<BR>
Michael- your note regarding food combinations seems very interesting<BR>
about causing bloating. Lately when I eat anything, seems like I get<BR>
extensive bloating and gas, I also have had lots of nausea and overall<BR>
feeling of malaise. I will be optimistic and hope that this will be<BR>
cleared up within a week (a better time of the month for me.)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks all for your knowledge, stories and encouragement.<BR>
<BR>
Peace, love, and healing,<BR>
<BR>

Christine:<BR>
The questions look good to me. Did you get the ones from Ben? I am<BR>
interested in the answer to some of his questions as well. And I know the<BR>
answer to one of them. Butter is okay because it is 100% fat, which means<BR>
of course that it doesn't have any carbohydrates including the lactose that<BR>
is in milk.<BR>
<BR>
Debora:<BR>
Just in case you didn't see it above, I answered you question about butter.<BR>
It contains no carbohydrates.<BR>
<BR>
Ben:<BR>
I didn't do the introductory diet either. Well, I did try it for a few<BR>
days, but I found myself feeling very tired. And I found the food so<BR>
unappetizing that I gave up after a few days. It was a few months later<BR>
that I gave the diet a try again without the introductory week, although
I<BR>
did avoid things like nuts and beans as suggested in the book. The diet
has<BR>
definitely helped me so I don't know how necessary that part of it really<BR>
is. I will be interested to see what Elaine has to say about it.<BR>
<BR>
Anna:<BR>
I know a lot of people have already responded to your yogurt question but
I<BR>
thought I could give you some input as well. I'm not sure what you mean
by<BR>
runny. If it is just not the same as store bought, well neither is mine.<BR>
But if it is still more liquid than solid then it sounds like it is not<BR>
fermenting properly. Michael's suggestion about checking the temperature
is<BR>
a good idea. What I do with my yogurt, because it is kind of lumpy is give<BR>
it a few seconds in the blender. This tends to make it pretty runny. So,
I<BR>
strain it through a dish towel like Elaine suggests for making the yogurt<BR>
like cream cheese, but only for 2 hours and that makes it a good consistency.<BR>
About the gas that you experience right after eating. Did you not have this<BR>
problem before starting the diet? I heard that this is caused by swallowing<BR>
air while you eat, which some people have a tendency to do. To prevent<BR>
this, you are suppose to eat slower and make sure you don't talk while eating.<BR>
<BR>
Take care everyone,<BR>

Dear Athena, I've been using half and half for my yogurt for the last several<BR>
months. I really enjoy the rich taste and consistancy. I know I should,
but I<BR>
haven't thought much about the fat content. My last checkup (May) revealed<BR>
extremely normal levels of everything. I don't even seem to be anemic anymore<BR>
(first time in 9 years). Bloating does seem to be the one residual symtom
I<BR>
still get. Not as often or as uncomfortable, but it sure beats having the<BR>
blood or the runs. Sorry, I can't find the lentil recipe you're looking
for,<BR>
but keep plugging. I know some days are harder than others, but the healing<BR>
will come.<BR>
Dear Kevin, Congradulations! 2 years! I often wonder how I'll handle it
(I've<BR>
got 16 months). I keep thinking that I will keep my diet status quo and
eat<BR>
&quot;illegal foods&quot; occasionally but I wonder if that will work or
if I have to<BR>
introduce things slowly and let my body adjust to each new food. Babies
are<BR>
introduced to new foods in small amounts and one at a time, so I guess thats<BR>
the best way to go. In any case I'd guess your body will tell you which
foods<BR>
are OK &amp; which are no-nos. I wish you much success.<BR>
RE: stopping medications, Funny it should come up now because I've taken<BR>
myself off azulphadine as of about 3 weeks ago. I'd been on only a gram
a day<BR>
for over a year. My doctor wanted me on at least 2 grams and claimed that
the<BR>
amount I'd been taking wasn't doing much anyways, so I've nervously gone<BR>
off. I'm real squeemish about it and keep thinking maybe I'm beginning to<BR>
feel this or that, but I think its nerves. I'd been on the stuff 8 years.<BR>
I've promised myself that at the first sign of blood, I'll go back on. Its<BR>
very liberating somehow, not to be chained to &quot;a daily dose&quot;,
but scary too.<BR>
Love to all, Rachel<BR>

to eat anything with that much fat, but if it works I will try it!&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I am the one who uses table cream to make yogurt. I can't say that it is
better<BR>
for a person then using regular milk to make the yogurt. A person must consider<BR>
the very high fat content and the excessive cost. For me, it is definitely<BR>
better as I am struggling to stay above 130 lbs on a 5'8&quot; frame. Also,
I really<BR>
hate the yogurt made from milk and would have to force myself to eat it.
The<BR>
cream yogurt is palatable to me and seems less acidic as well. Each person<BR>
would have to consider the high fat content before eating it on a regular
basis.<BR>
I think a chat with your doctor and maybe a baseline cholesterol test would
be<BR>
reasonable before using this kind of yogurt regularly.<BR>
<BR>
I can't agree with you more how encouraging it is to hear other people's
success<BR>
stories. My doctor believes in rallying the immune system in whatever way<BR>
possible, be it laughter, exercise, or encouragement from a support group.
It's<BR>
not known why some people's immune systems give out on them allowing these<BR>
diseases to take over, but there is some indication that a strong social
support<BR>
system and maintaining a positive attitude can contribute to the cure. Dr.<BR>

Hi Ann,<BR>
<BR>
All is well (according to the garage) with my car, and, thankfully, this
time it<BR>
was still under the warranty . . . my luck she is a changing!<BR>
<BR>
You wrote the following:<BR>
<BR>
