<BR>
No. Buckwheat has no relation to wheat. It's not even in the grass family,<BR>
but is botanically considered a fruit. It is used as a cover crop, and<BR>
there is the possibility of volunteer wheat mixed in. Also there is always<BR>
the possibility of contamination in the processing and milling of it. To be<BR>
safe one can buy whole seeds, visually inspect them, then grind them oneself.<BR>

&gt; Some of the<BR>

&gt;curious.  Does this make coherent sense to someone who knows more about<BR>
&gt;nutrition?<BR></FONT>
<BR>
Not really. But do remember that different people have different food<BR>
intolerances. But this doesn't seem to be a diet tailored to the<BR>
individual, but predesigned to fit all. Remember there is this list from<BR>
The Lancet for people with Crohns (though this diet here is for someone<BR>
with UC): wheat, dairy products, brassicas, maize, yeast, tomatoes, citrus<BR>
fruits, eggs, tap water, coffee, banana, potato, lamb, pork, beef, rice,<BR>
tea, fish, onions, chicken, barley, rye, turkey, additives, alcohol,<BR>
chocolate, shellfish, swede (rutabaga).<BR>

&gt;&lt;&lt;She could eat no meat or meat products including beef, chicken, fish, pork<BR>
&gt;or turkey.<BR></FONT>
<BR>
You didn't note what Asian country the doctor was from. Possibly India<BR>
where there are many vegetarians? Maybe a little animal rights ethics<BR>
tossed into the diet for good measure? But then you will find all these<BR>
meats in The Lancet list, so they must bother at least some people.<BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt; No wheat or wheat products including breads, cake and pasta, no<BR>

Since the doctor was asian, I'm thinking this must be a macrobiotic<BR>
diet.  Looks like it at first glance too.  Macrobiotic diets work on<BR>
principles of balance that help heal the body, I would be foolish to try<BR>
to explain it because don't know it well enough.  That's what it looks<BR>
like though.  There's a doctor named Mishio Kushi who is pretty famous<BR>
for working with macrobiotic diets in this country.<BR>

<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Hello everyone...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Before reading Elaine's book, I was taking &quot;Whey to go&quot;, a whey protein<BR>
&gt;powder that is lactose free, no added sugars, no artificial sweeteners; and<BR>
&gt;is enriched with free-form l-glutamine and branched chain amino acids. The<BR>
&gt;label states that there is 1g carbohydrate (from the vanilla bean<BR>
&gt;flavoring) and 17g protein and 1g sugars (no fructose or sucrose) in one<BR>
&gt;scoop (abt. 2 Tbsp.).  What is Elaine's objection to &quot;whey&quot; and do you<BR>
&gt;think this would be okay to take as a supplement that would possibly help<BR>
&gt;the looooooow energy/fatigue syndrome I am having?<BR>
<BR></FONT>
Sheila:<BR>
I would be very surprised if a deconstructed and enriched mild product<BR>
would give enery to you. I feel that the barley green or marine algae or<BR>
spirulina would be a better bet.<BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Called Life Plus re colodyne and these are the ingredients:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;salivarius, lactobaccilis, acidolophus, bifidus, microflora bacteria, made<BR>
&gt;with psyllium seed, flax seed, marine algaenate, guar gum, beet root,<BR>
&gt;bentonite, black walnut leaves, acidolphus culture and mennitol.  This is<BR>
&gt;sold as a colon cleanser.<BR>
<BR></FONT>
SS:<BR>
The above looks very good however I would check the 'mannitol' (sp). What<BR>
is it? Also, marine alginate is marine algae. Elaine says no marine algae<BR>
but only because carageenan is not allowed and she feels people would be<BR>
confused and so she restricts all marine algae. Bentonite is a volcanic ash<BR>
and helps pull out toxic metals and minerals etc however if inflammation<BR>
exists I don't know if it would be caustic. However it is also an antidote<BR>
for many intestinal poisons.<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;<BR>
&gt;My chiro recommends another one:  Nature's Biotics, from Life Science<BR>
&gt;Products, Inc. in St. George, Utah, 1-800-713-3888 to order and<BR>
&gt;1-801-628-4111 for product info, speak to David Dodart.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;He says this is fabulous for colon problems; has no fillers, no salt,<BR>
&gt;carbs/sugars. Has minerals/trace elements and will give better nutrient<BR>
&gt;absorption and therefore, result in higher energy which some of us are<BR>
&gt;struggling with.He says to start out with, taken only 1/2 or 1/4 capsule<BR>
&gt;and follow directions on bottle then slowly increase the dosage.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Ingredients:  lactobacillus, acidophilus, bifidobacterium Bifidium,<BR>
&gt;Bacillus Licheniformis, Bacillus Subtillis, Lactobacills Lactis,<BR>
&gt;Lactobacillus Bulgaricus, in a host medium of minerals and trace elements.<BR>
<BR></FONT>
SS:<BR>
This one sounds the safest to me. However it doesn't having the cleansing<BR>
properties of the 2nd one ie guar gum, psyllium etc.
<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;<BR>
&gt;QUESTION:  I don't know enough about the ingredients of these two colon<BR>
&gt;cleansers to know which would be best for me and others on the SCD.  Does<BR>
&gt;anyone have any ideas about this?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Would appreciate response on these 3 items:  Whey to Go, by Solgar; Nature<BR>
&gt;Biotics; and Colodyne.<BR>

Hi Bart,<BR>
<BR>
I had plenty of time to read this aft while I had my car in the shop and I<BR>
covered ground with Dr D'Adamo's 'Eating Right For Your (Blood) Type'.<BR>
That's the source of the latest conversation on the issue. I feel the book<BR>
contains some interesting ideas that I intuitively relate to. I am a type<BR>
O, the oldest and one unable to touch dairy, grains, and most beans. Sounds<BR>
like the SCD diet! which works perfectly for me. However, he says the<BR>
information is primarily annecdotal and he does have some sources.<BR>
<BR>
I feel Sears 'Zone' and D'Adamo's 'Type' are both pieces of the puzzle and<BR>
I feel I need to relate to the material and diet instinctually. Gottschall<BR>
is the most scientifically based to my mind and hits the nail on the head<BR>
with IBD.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

i'm sure i'm behind the times..but while doing some research about Klaper's

someone would tell me what they think about this substance, does it work and how

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Cat's Claw for Arthritis, Cancer, AIDS, Degenerative Diseases, and Premature
Aging?<B></FONT><BR><BR>

Studies Beginning in the 1970's Suggest Many Uses for Cat's Claw<BR><BR>

A new botanical nutrient, Uncaria Tomentosa, is being called by many the &quot;Miracle
Herb from the Rain Forest of Peru&quot;. It has been drawing increasingly more
interest among the proponents of natural health care. Although virtually unheard
of in the United States until recently, the beneficial effects of the Peruvian
herb Uncaria tomentosa, commonly known as &quot;una de gato&quot; in Spanish and &quot;cat's
claw&quot; in English, have been studied at research facilities in Peru, Austria,
Germany, England, Hungary and Italy, since the 1970's. These studies suggest that
the herb may be beneficial in the treatment of arthritis. bursitis, allergies,
diabetes, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, cancer, herpes, organic depression,
menstrual irregularities and disorders of the stomach and intestines. (References
1, 2, 3)<BR><BR>

Properties attributed to cat's claw include:<BR>


<LI>Adaptogenic 
<LI>Anti-microbial 
<LI>Antioxidant 
<LI>Anti-viral

<LI>Anti-inflammatory 
<LI>Anti-tumor

<BR><BR>

This emergence of knowledge about the activity of cat's claw could not have come
at a better time! Many people have become fearful that the war on cancer is being
lost, that new potentially deadly viruses are evolving, and that more deadly
&quot;super-bacteria&quot; are developing due to over use of prescription antibiotics. This
is why increased attention is being placed upon &quot;Nature's Pharmacy&quot;, the
botanical or herbal nutrients that offer so much hope.<BR><BR>

In referring to cat's claw, Newsweek reported that this &quot;rain forest herb has
been long used to treat asthma, ulcers, and cancer. (&quot;Nature's
Biggest Sellers&quot;, Newsweek, November 6, 1995, page 68) In an article in Newlife,
this herb was described as having so many therapeutic uses that it far surpasses
such well known botanicals as Echinacea, Golden Seal,
Astragalus, Siberian Ginseng, as well as Reishi and Shaitake mushrooms. (&quot;Cat's
Claw
- A Wonder Herb from the Peruvian Rain Forest&quot;, Newlife, February, 1995)<BR><BR>

Dr. Brent Davis described cat's claw as &quot;The Opener of the Way&quot; in referring to
its ability to detoxify the intestinal Tract and to treat a variety of stomach
and bowel disorders. (Cat's Claw News, May/June, 1995)
<BR><BR>

The anti-inflammatory qualities of cat's claw have been found to be useful in the
treatment of arthritis. (Journal of Natural Products, 54: Page 453, 1991;
Arthritis News, 1: Summer, 1989)<BR><BR>

The possible anti-cancer qualities of cat's claw were explored in a study on the
mutagenic (ability to create mutations) activity in cigarette smokers' urine.
Non-smokers did not show mutagenic activity in their urine, while cigarette
smokers did. After taking this natural plant substance, smokers' urine showed a
dramatic decrease of mutagenic activity. (&quot;Mutagenic and Antimutagenic Activity
of Uncaria&quot;, Journal of Ethnopharmacy, 38: page 63, 1993)<BR><BR>

<B>The Effects of Cat's Claw on Intestinal Permeability (Leaky Gut Syndrome)</B>
<BR><BR>

After using cat's claw in working with approximately 150 patients between 1988
and 1992, Dr. Brent Davis reports that &quot;Uncaria tomentosa has the ability to
break through severe intestinal derangements that no other available products can
touch.&quot; He refers to the herb as &quot;the opener of the way&quot; because of its
remarkable ability to cleanse the entire intestinal tract and help patients
suffering from many different stomach and bowel disorders including leaky bowel
syndrome. irritable bowel syndrome,
Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, hemorrhoids. fistulas. gastritis, ulcers,
parasites and intestinal flora imbalance. (References 1,2,3)<BR><BR>

By cleansing the intestinal walls, cat's claw enables the body to better absorb
nutrients, thus helping to correct nutritional imbalances created by digestive
blockages. (Reference 2) Many doctors today believe that cat's claw may have a
&quot;profound ability to get rid of deep-seated infection lodged in the bowel and
perhaps even the mesentery, which can derange the uterus and associated anatomic
parts: the prostate, liver, spleen, kidneys, thymus and thyroid, for
starters.&quot;(5) Davis calls cat's claw &quot;a world class herb which has the power to
arrest and reverse deep-seated pathology allowing a more rapid return to
health...'' (References l, 2)<BR><BR>

The Ashanika Indians of Peru have long regarded una de gato tea as a sacred
beverage. It is used as a cleansing and tonic herb for the immune, intestinal and
structural systems.<BR><BR>

In traditional medicine of Peru, una de gato is categorized as a &quot;warm plant&quot; or,
more accurately, for warm conditions (inflammations) including arthritis,
gastritis, asthma and dermal and genito-urinary tract inflammations. It is also
used to treat diabetes, cancer, tumors, viral infections, menstrual disorders
convalescence and debility. A few tribes also use cat's claw as a remedy for
dysentery, (Reference 6) and at least one tribe uses the herb to treat gonorrhea.
(Reference 7)<BR><BR>

<B>Cat's Claw Can Reduce Pain and Inflammation in Arthritic Conditions</B>
<BR><BR>

The anti-inflammatory effects of cat's claw have proven beneficial in the
treatment of arthritis, rheumatism, bursitis and gout. As an antioxidant, it also
helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Its beneficial effects
in treating arthritis pain may also be due, in part,
to its ability to cleanse the digestive tract and aid in removing toxins
from the body. Arthritis, joint pain and inflammation as well as chronic fatigue,
allergies, immune deficiency and a host of other conditions have been associated
with defects in intestinal permeability (leaky bowel syndrome! and toxin
overload. (References 9, 10)<BR><BR>

Some of the glycosides present in the herb may also add protection from pain.
This may explain, in part, how cat's claw has been helpful in reducing pain
associated with chemotherapy, radiation treatment and AZT use. (Reference l1)<BR><BR>

A wealth of beneficial phytochemicals have been found in cat's claw including
quinovic acid glycosides, several oxindol alkaloids, proanthocyanidins,
polyphenols, triterpines and the plant sterols beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol and
campesterol. (References l, 3) Researchers believe that the activity of the whole
plant extract is
greater than the sum of its parts. (References 3, 5, 7)<BR><BR>

<B>Cat's Claw Alkaloids Stimulate General Immunity</B><BR>
<BR>

Unique alkaloids in una de gato seem to enhance the immune system in a general
way. These alkaloids have a pronounced effect on the ability of white blood cells
to engulf and digest harmful micro-organisms and
foreign matter. (Reference 3) Austrian researcher Klaus Keplinger has obtained
two U.S. patents for isolating some of the herb's major components. According to
these patents, six oxindol alkaloids have been isolated from cat's
claw and four of these have been proven &quot;suitable for the unspecified stimulation
of the immunologic system&quot;. Laboratory testing has shown
these alkaloids to have a pronounced enhancement effect on phagocytosis (the
ability of the white blood cells and macrophages to attack, engulf and digest
harmful micro-organisms, foreign matter and debris). The most immunologically
active alkaloid appears to be isoteropodine or isomer A. (References 1, 2) Cat's
claw has also been shown to increase the
production of leukocytes and specifically T4 lymphocytes, thus blocking the
advance
of many viral illnesses. Quinovic acid glycosides in cat's claw back up the
immune system and protect the body from viruses and virus caused cancers.
(References l, 2)<BR><BR>

Dr. Donna Schwontkowski, D.C., calls cat's claw the most powerful immune-enhancer
of all the herbs native to the Peruvian Amazon.
Preliminary studies suggest that the herb has the ability to stop viral
infections in the early stages, help patients who are chemically sensitive, fight
opportunistic infections in AIDS patients and de-crease the visible size
of some skin tumors and cysts. (References 3, 8) According to Dr. Satya Ambrose,
N. D., cats claw seems to enhance overall immunity while increasing stamina and
energy in patients who suffer from physical and mental exhaustion due to an
overactive or stressful lifestyle. (Reference 3)<BR><BR>

<B>Rynchophylline Inhibits Platelet Aggregation and Thrombosis</B><BR>
<BR>

Rynchophylline, a fifth alkaloid found in Uncaria tomentosa, has been studied at
the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In laboratory testing,
rynchophylline displays an ability to inhibit
platelet aggregation and thrombosis. This suggests that cat's claw may be useful
in preventing strokes and reducing the risk of heart attack by lowering
blood pressure, increasing circulation, inhibiting formation of plaque on
arterial walls and formation of blood clots in the brain, heart and arteries.
(Reference 2)<BR><BR>

It is important to understand that most of the clinical research, trials and
reports completed to date which show the alkaloids to be antiviral,
anti-inflammatory, immuno-stimulating, antimutagenic, antioxidant and
have other benefits, are tests determining the alkaloid's active principals
&quot;in-vitro&quot;. This means they have been proven in the test tube - not &quot;in-vivo&quot;, or
in the human body. While these in-vitro tests are very promising, many more
in-vivo tests will be needed to determine the true efficacy of this plant for
specific diseases in humans.<BR><BR>

Three trials that could be considered in-vivo, were in fact, human
studies. Two were performed using &quot;Krallendorn&quot; which is a cat's claw extract
produced by a German company called Immodal. One of these documents is termed a
&quot;therapy observation&quot; and spans a ten year period with 78
patients suffering from brain tumors treated with Krallendorn. Another is a
summary of a trial with 32 HIV-infected patients treated with Krallendorn from
1987 to 1991. The third in-vivo test was performed by an Italian group
studying the plant's antimutagenic properties on smokers and non-smokers.<BR><BR>

In-vivo tests and trials are currently underway at several institutions
in several countries and some preliminary results look promising, but the final
results are not in yet. Cat's claw has not been clinically proven
to cure AIDS or cancer.<BR><BR>

One of the best sources on cat's claw is the book, The Saga of the Cat's Claw, by
Dr. Fernando Cabieses. Dr. Cabieses is a well known neurologist and neurosurgeon
with residency in Lima, Peru. He is Professor Emeritus
at the Universidad Mayor de San Marcos and Honorary Professor at the Universities
of Trujillo, Piura, Cajamarca, Chiclayo, Cusco, Arequipa and Garcilaso de la
Vega. He is also Clinical Professor of Neurosurgery at
the University of Miami, Florida, a member of the World Health Organization
Committee for Traditional Medicine and is the Chairman of the Instituto Nacional
de Medicina Tradicional of Peru, a branch of the Ministry of Health (The National
Institute of Traditional Medicine of Peru). He has studied cat's claw
extensively, as well as all available clinical
research reports and trials. In his book, he gives a clear and easily understood
translation of each of the clinical in-vitro studies and what they mean.
We would like to share his views on cat's claw concerning AIDS in his book:<BR><BR>

&quot;Therefore, 'in-vitro', we already know that the alkaloids of our plant stimulate
the immune mechanisms. This is excellent. It opens a promising avenue of research
&quot;in-vivo&quot; in order to determine whether these
substances are active in conditions where the immune system is depressed. None of
us is unaware of AIDS, the horrible monster stalking humanity, and much hue and
cry has been raised about Uncaria tomentosa's effects as a miracle
cure for this cursed condition. But so far, no such cure exists. Most of the
alleged successes are the works of quacks, adventurers and outright swindlers.
Some of the noise comes from a few bona-fide but ignorant physicians or others
influenced by cases which are certainly interesting but, unfortunately, poorly
documented. The subject demands much more
study, and to speak now of &quot;cures&quot; when the evaluation is still under way
cruelly raises false hopes in desperate people. Several Peruvian groups, among
them Professor Eduardo Gotuzzo and Doctor Rosario Rojas, are currently conducting
topnotch studies which should soon give us more reliable information. &quot;<BR><BR>

Dr. Cabieses' closing statements in The Saga of the Cat's Claw are the
following:<BR><BR>

&quot;The proper design of research protocols for human application in neoplastic
diseases and in severe problems of immune deficiency (AIDS) is not child's play,
and the limits between the possible and the desirable
are frequently cloudy and diffuse. A link between &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; is now
being designed in Peruvian medical institutions of great prestige
like the University Cayetano Heredia and Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades
Neoplasicas, as well as under the direction of experts in alternative medicines
like natural medicine (Father Edmundo Szeliga, Doctor Mirez, Doctor Lida Obregon)
and homeopathy (Dr. F. P. Iaccarino). This leads me
to believe that it won't be too long, dear reader, before you and I can sit down
together again for a second addition of this monograph.<BR><BR>

Meanwhile, what should we do? What should you and I do with all the information
invading our homes and our hospitals about &quot;Una de Gato&quot; in Peru? What do we do,
dear aunt of my neighbor? What do we do, dear
doctor, respected colleague? Do we resist the tide and abstain from using this
interesting plant of our jungle? What do we tell our friend, the
desperate father of the young fellow who has AIDS? Do we tell him to ignore this
ray of hope? Do we, as doctors, tell our patient suffering from a malignant tumor
not to seek refuge in &quot;Una de Gato&quot;, at least to satisfy his desperate relatives?
Or do we tell our patients and our friends to buy a ticket to this lottery and
see what happens with &quot;Una de Gato&quot;? Do we
love Uncaria or not? Do we accept it or prohibit it?<BR><BR>

Biology's dizzying advances have confronted us with hundreds of dilemmas like
this one. When you face a true dilemma, you suddenly find that you have no
answers. A dilemma is a question without answers. Or, to put it better, a dilemma
is a question with two or more answers, whose every answer is at once attractive
and defensible and capable of leading us to defeat and frustration. Modern
biology has brought us to a vast field
paved with dilemmas like this; disoriented, we now seek satisfaction for all
our doubts and questions. Such satisfaction does not exist. A road there must be
built and found in the labyrinth of biological dilemmas, and the way
to do so is called Bio-ethics.<BR><BR>

The ethics of Biology. A science that still does not clearly exist. An elusive,
slippery, unattainable moral law. A set of rules where it is always difficult to
find what is good, what is proper, what is just. A
time bomb hidden behind each scientific discovery.<BR><BR>

That is why I wrote this monograph. To shed some light on this difficult path.
Here we have a &quot;new&quot; medication which is recommended and praised by many people
who have used it. Here we have scientific evidence that it is not toxic.
Laboratory tests carried out in serious academic institutions prove that the
extracts of this plant have clear anti-inflammatory
effects, that it has some action modulating the immune mechanisms, and that, in
certain circumstances, it inhibits the crazed growth of cancerous
cells...<BR><BR>

So we still have not identified the active principal? We have not identified how
it works? For two hundred years, quina bark saved more
lives annually than those killed by the atomic bomb in 1945. And during all
those years, nobody knew that there was an alkaloid which would later be named
Quinine. For a hundred years, humankind used aspirin to stop pain and
inflammation, though nobody knew until the discovery of prostaglandins
why it worked.<BR><BR>

Of course, in this dangerous quagmire of official indecision, the indifference of
the authorities and the absence of controls acts as an incentive to fraud, to the
illegal substitution of products, to falsification, adulteration and deceit.
These should lead us, physicians and conscientious citizens, to help our patients
and friends help themselves against con artists and quacks and who promote
spurious and adulterated products. All physicians who have patients taking this
particular medicinal plant should try to document seriously and scientifically
all those cases, positive or negative, in order to gather enough scientific
information about the medical effects of Uncaria.<BR><BR>

documents from around the world. These are the opinions and claims

Excerpted from the book: Herbs of the Amazon - Traditional and Common
Uses, by Dr. Donna Schwontkowski, Doctor of Chiropractic:
<BR><BR>

&quot;Una de Gato is considered one of the most important botanicals in the
rain forest. In Peru, Una de Gato tea is used as a medicinal herb with almost
unlimited curative properties. This herb is a powerful cellular rejuvenator. It
has been used for the treatment of gastritis
(inflammation of the stomach), ulcers, cancer, arthritis, rheumatism,
irregularities of the female cycle, and acne. It is also used to treat organic
depression. External applications of Una de Gato include the treatment of wounds,
fungus, fistulas and hemorrhoids. European research shows that Una de
Gato activates the immune system by increasing lymphocytic (white blood cell)
activity.&quot;
<BR><BR>

Excerpted from the book: Traditional Uses of Rainforest Botanicals by
John Easterling:
<BR><BR>

&quot;It is considered one of the most important botanicals in the Rainforest. By
supporting and enhancing immune system function, Una de Gato is indicated in a
broad spectrum of conditions including all types of infections. Urarina tribesman
of Peru tell stories of Una de Gato curing tumors. Una de Gato was one of the
plants researched by the National Institute for Health as an anti-cancer agent.
Studies from various laboratories indicate it normalizes the immunoglobins by
activating T-lymphocytes and macrophages.&quot;
<BR><BR>

Excerpted from the book: Powerful and Unusual Herbs from the Amazon and China,
Published by the World Preservation Society:
<BR><BR>

&quot;Una de Gato from the Peruvian rain forest is a favorite for stimulating the
immune system. World wide research done on this powerful herb has led scientists
to patent many of the single chemicals found in it for use in healing cancer,
arthritis, AIDS, and other diseases. However, traditional wisdom shows that using
the whole plant can be far more powerful than any one isolated ingredient.&quot;
<BR><BR>

Excerpted from The Herb Quarterly, Winter 1994, in an article titled
&quot;Cat's Claw (Una de Gato) A Wondrous Herb From the Amazon Rain Forest&quot; by
Phillip Steinberg:
<BR><BR>

&quot;In July 1989, U.S. Patent No 4,844,901 was issued to an Austrian
scientist named Klaus Keplinger, and a second patent, No. 4,940,725, was issued
to him in July 1990. These patents explain how Dr. Keplinger isolated six
oxindole alkaloids from the root of Uncaria tomentosa and that four of these
alkaloids have been proven to be &quot;suitable for the unspecified stimulation of the
immunologic system&quot;. According to Keplinger's
research, these four alkaloids have been shown to have a pronounced enhancement
effect on phagocytosis (the ability of the white blood cells and macrophages to
attack, engulf and digest harmful micro-organisms, foreign matter, and debris.)
According to both patents, the most immunologically active alkaloid is
isopteropodine or isomer A. Besides isomer A and the other three
immuno-stimulating alkaloids, there exists another alkaloid known as
rynchophylline. This alkaloid has been studied at the Shanghai College of
Traditional Medicine. According to their findings, rynchophylline has
demonstrated an ability to inhibit platelet
aggregation and Thrombosis, which suggests that rynchophylline may be useful in
preventing strokes and reducing the risk of heart attack by lowering
blood pressure, increasing circulation, and inhibiting both the formation of
plaque on the arterial walls and the formation of blood clots in the
brain, heart, and arteries.&quot;<BR>

Subject: <B>Observation about SCD and other &quot;Diets&quot;</B><BR>
<BR>
Today, I was reading an advertisement for a newsletter from The Atkins<BR>
Health Center and I realized that when you compare SCD with &quot;The Zone&quot;,<BR>
&quot;Protien Power&quot;, &quot;The Atkins Diet&quot; (called the low carbohydrate diet)<BR>
and a diet I found in Hal Huggins book, &quot;It's All in Your Head&quot; they are<BR>
all very similar.<BR>
<BR>
I found this to be encouraging. I realized that SCD basically<BR>
represented the CORRECT way we should eat, not just something that we<BR>
should follow to get well and then back to the &quot;real way&quot; we should eat.<BR>
I realized that the perspective that I should stay on this diet until my<BR>
symptoms went away, and then I can gradually go back to a near &quot;normal&quot;<BR>
diet, as long as I stay away from sugar and white bread, has been the<BR>
major source of recurrent flares for me. We simply were not intended to<BR>
eat a whole lot of these types of foods, if at all. <BR>
<BR>
This is probably obvious to all of you, but I guess I am particularly<BR>
slow. I don't know if this will help anyone else, but I thought I'd<BR>
post it in case it might encourage someone else as much as it encouraged<BR>
me. For what it's worth...<BR>
