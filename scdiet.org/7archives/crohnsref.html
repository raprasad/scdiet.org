<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease are usually treated
with prednisolone or potentially more toxic immunosuppressive
drugs or by surgery. In pilot studies replacing the normal diet
by a protein free elemental diet also induced remission. A controlled
trial was therefore conducted in which 21 patients acutely ill
with exacerbations of Crohn's disease were randomised to receive
either prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day or an elemental diet (Vivonex)
for four weeks. Assessment at four and 12 weeks showed that the
patients treated with the elemental diet had improved as much
as and by some criteria more than the steroid treated group. Elemental
diet is a safe and effective treatment for acute Crohn's disease.

<DD>Thirty-three patients with Crohn's Disease were studied to
see if their symptoms were related to food intolerances. Initial
treatment to produce remission of symptoms was total parenteral
nutrition (20), elemental diet (2) or elimination diet (11). Twenty-nine
patients reported specific food intolerances, and 21 of these
remained in remission on diet alone, the mean length of remission
being 15.2 months. The most important foods provoking symptoms
were wheat and dairy products.<BR>

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Energy, nitrogen absorption, and nitrogen utilization of two
commercial elemental diets, Vivonex and Vital, were compared in
10 teenage boys and girls with Crohn's disease. The diets were
given in random order as overnight feedings and were the sole
source of nutrients for two consecutive periods of 3 weeks each.
Urine and stools were collected for 48 h at the end of each 3-week
period. Energy absorption was slightly better on Vivonex (p less
than 0.05), although 95-100% of energy was absorbed with both
formulas. Nitrogen absorption was not different for the two formulas,
but nitrogen utilization was significantly better on Vital (28.6
+/- 12.9% versus 9.7 +/- 17.7%, p less than 0.01). This difference
may be attributable to the different concentrations of sulfur-containing
and aromatic amino acids in the two formulas.<BR>

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>In a randomised clinical trial, patients with moderately active
Crohn's disease received either prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day plus
a normal diet, or an elemental diet plus oral framycetin, colistin
and nystatin. Patients were assessed using the Crohn's disease
activity index (CDAI), ESR, and faecal granulocyte excretion quantified
by 111In-autologous leucocytes. Five patients were intolerant
of the elemental diet plus antibiotics and were withdrawn from
the trial within 72 hours. Sixteen patients completed 10 days
treatment on each regime. Fifteen of 16 patients on elemental
diet plus antibiotics and all 16 patients on prednisolone improved
with marked, but statistically indistinguishable falls in CDAI,
ESR, and faecal granulocyte excretion between the two groups.
Thus a regime decreasing the intraluminal concentration of bacteria
and complex food molecules, was associated with rapid improvement
in activity of Crohn's disease. This suggests that these intraluminal
factors play a role in maintaining inflammation and that their
removal or alteration offers an approach to management.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Total parenteral nutrition or elemental diet can be used to
induce remission of Crohn's disease. A randomized study has been
conducted of 36 patients to assess the relative efficacy of the
two techniques used without pharmacologic support; both were successful,
and no significant differences emerged in the number of days to
remission or the mean changes in Crohn's disease activity index,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or serum albumin. The elemental
diet is cheaper, simpler and safer. Uncontrolled clinical experience
with 77 patients showed that personalized food exclusion diets
were associated with an average annual relapse rate of only 11%
for the first five years of diet alone; there have been six pregnancies
and the longest remission is now 75 months. The use of elemental
diet followed by the development of a personal food exclusion
diet appears to be an effective long-term therapeutic strategy
for Crohn's disease.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Growth failure often complicates Crohn's disease in pediatric
patients and is principally due to inadequate caloric intake.
To assess whether intermittent courses of an elemental diet could
reestablish growth, 8 children (aged 9.8-14.2 yr) with Crohn's
disease and growth failure entered into a prospective trial. Each
patient was studied during an observation year on standard therapy,
then for an experimental year during which they received enteral
elemental diet 1 out of 4 mo. An age- and disease-matched control
group of 4 patients was treated by conventional medical therapy
during both years. Elemental diet therapy was administered nocturnally,
at home, by continuous nasogastric infusion and increased the
daily caloric intake by 25% (p less than 0.01). Anthropometric
measurements demonstrated significant height and weight gains
in the elemental diet group vs. controls (p less than 0.01). Crohn's
disease activity index and prednisone intake decreased significantly
in patients receiving elemental diet therapy when compared with
themselves and with controls on conventional medical therapy (p
less than 0.05). In contrast, the rate of pubertal development
was similar in both groups irrespective of the treatment modality.
This study demonstrates that chronic intermittent elemental diet
effectively reverses growth arrest, while decreasing prednisone
requirements and Crohn's disease activity index in pediatric Crohn's
disease patients prior to puberty.

<DD>The recognition of potentially noxious physiologic substances
in the intestinal milieu prompted the use of an &quot;elemental&quot;
semihydrolyzed formula diet in the prophylaxis of experimental
acute ischemic enteropathy. Elemental diets have been used in
the management of a variety of digestive diseases. An elemental
diet protects the intestinal mucosa of rodents from radiation
injury and facilitates mucosal healing. Clinical trials have shown
the benefits of this form of treatment in the prevention of acute
radiation enteropathy and in the therapy for delayed radiation
enteropathy and Crohn's disease.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Recent studies have shown an elemental diet to be as effective
as bowel rest plus steroids in the management of acute Crohn's
disease. In order to investigate the metabolic and immunological
effects of these two therapies, six patients with an acute inflammatory
attack of ileal Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to receive
steroids or elemental diet for 7 days. Immunological and protein
metabolic studies were performed before and after therapy, protein
kinetic rates being measured by the method of constant intravenous
infusion of 14C-labeled leucine tracer. Clinical and symptomatic
improvement was noted in all six patients with significant falls
in sedimentation rate and platelet counts and increases in albumin
concentrations. Both forms of treatment increased plasma amino
acid flux and oxidation rates, whole body protein turnover and
rates of incorporation of amino acid into albumin. However, the
increased rates of protein metabolism in the patients given steroids
were at the expense of body protein stores with a net (average)
loss of 58 g of nitrogen over 7 days. While both forms of therapy
were associated with suppression of lymphocyte subsets, complement
and circulating immune complexes only the steroid regimen was
associated with suppression of in vivo IgG synthesis rates. The
results indicated that both forms of therapy were associated with
clinical improvement, increases in protein turnover and evidence
of reduced inflammatory activity. However, the beneficial effects
of steroid regimen must be balanced against the deleterious effects
on body protein stores; steroids and bowel rest without nutritional
support should be avoided in malnourished patients.<BR>

<DD>Intestinal permeability to sugar has been used as an objective
measure of small bowel integrity to assess the efficacy of an
elemental diet as the sole treatment or Crohn's disease of the
small bowel. Fourteen children aged 11-17 years with active small
bowel Crohn's disease were given an elemental diet for six weeks.
Investigations with iso-osmolar oral test solutions before and
after this treatment showed that all 14 children had abnormally
raised lactulose/L-rhamnose permeability ratios, which fell significantly
after the elemental diet. This change coincided with marked clinical
improvement, as assessed by a disease activity index score.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>The nutrient intake of 137 outpatients with Crohn's disease
was recorded, and the effect of diet counseling was assessed.
Half the patients received monthly diet counseling that was individualized
and aimed at normalizing nutrient intake; the other half of the
patients received no diet counseling and served as controls. Over
the 6-month study period, the mean nutrient intakes met or exceeded
the 1980 U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for all nutrients
except folate in the men and iron and folate in the women. However,
at study entry, for each nutrient there was a substantial proportion
of patients whose intake did not meet the full RDA. Less than
50% of the men consumed the full RDA for energy and folate, and
less than 50% of the women consumed the full RDA for energy, folate,
calcium, iron, thiamin, and vitamin B-12. Monthly diet counseling
sessions were associated with increases in the mean intake of
most nutrients, whereas similar improvement was not observed in
the control group members, who did not receive counseling. By
6 months, significantly more counseled than non-counseled patients
were consuming the full RDA for protein, riboflavin, and vitamin
C (p less than .05). Thus, diet counseling was found to be an
important tool for improving the nutrient intake of outpatients
with Crohn's disease.<BR>

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Changes in diet from ancient times until the present are described.
Previously relatively low in energy and animal products yet high
in fibre-containing foods, diets are now high in energy and animal
products (particularly fat), yet contain less fibre. The changing
incidences of bowel disorders and diseases are described, with
assessments of the role of diet. Clearly, diet is implicated as
regards predisposition to constipation, appendicitis, colorectal
cancer and diverticular disease; however, a meaningful dietary
role in irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease is doubtful. In South Africa the rarity of bowel diseases
in rural blacks compared with whites affords valuable aetiological
information about some bowel diseases. The low occurrence thereof
(except inflammatory bowel disease) in Indian and coloured populations
is not readily explicable. While dietary changes in whites are
being widely urged in order to combat degenerative diseases, the
magnitude of changes made is unlikely to reduce the occurrence
of bowel diseases. The progressive westernization of the diets
and lifestyles of less-privileged populations is likely to be
associated with increases in the incidences of these diseases.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>A prospective study was undertaken to establish the role of
individualized diet counselling in the management of 137 outpatients
with Crohn's disease. Individualized dietary counselling for 6
months was associated with a significant decrease in the Crohn's
disease activity index, an increased incidence of disease remission,
a decreased need for prednisone and Salazopyrin therapy, a reduction
in the number of days spent in hospital, and a reduction in the
amount of time lost from work due to Crohn's disease, when compared
with control patients who did not receive dietary counselling
but who were seen regularly in follow-up under similar circumstances.
Improvement with diet counselling was more likely to occur in
patients who had not previously been subjected to small bowel
resection, and occurred in patients with active or inactive disease.
The effect of counselling 58 patients was assessed over a further
6 months (for a total 12-month period); there was a persistently
reduced Crohn's disease activity index and a continued decreased
number of lost days of work. The mechanism for these beneficial
effects of diet counselling was not established. It is suggested
that individualized diet counselling, aimed at optimizing the
patient's nutritional status, may play a role in the management
of patients with Crohn's disease.

<DD>Vitamin C intake, and serum and leukocyte ascorbate levels
were assessed serially over 6 months in 137 outpatients with Crohn's
disease. Vitamin C intake was low in 18% of males and 37% of females.
Serum ascorbate levels were suboptimal in 11% of males and 18%
of females. Leukocyte ascorbate levels were low in 26% of males
and 49% of females. Serum ascorbate levels were more frequently
below the reference range in patients who smoked, but neither
the serum nor the leukocyte ascorbate levels were affected by
Crohn's disease activity, the use of an oral contraceptive agent,
or by taking prednisone or sulfasalazine. Monthly diet counseling
sessions significantly increased vitamin C intake, led to more
patients consuming a normal ascorbate intake, and to a normalization
of serum ascorbate values. We did not establish the importance
of these ascorbate abnormalities on the clinical course of Crohn's
disease. We conclude that low serum or leukocyte ascorbate levels
are relatively common in patients with active or inactive Crohn's
disease; these abnormalities are due in part to the reduced intake
of dietary ascorbate; and the ascorbate status in patients with
Crohn's disease may be normalized by improving the dietary intake
of vitamin C.<BR>

Seven children were given intramuscular adrenocorticotrophic hormone

effective in inducing an improvement in Lloyd-Still disease activity

<DD>The present study questions the concept of routinely using
'starter regimens' at the outset of enteral feeding with chemically
defined elemental diets. A hypertonic elemental diet with an osmolality
of 630 mOsm/kg was administered by 24-hr nasogastric infusion
to 12 patients with exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease
and to two patients with short bowel syndrome. Starter regimens
were not used. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, abdominal
bloating, and colicky pain occurred transiently in only five of
14 patients. Stool frequency did not increase during full-strength
feeding, and daily stool weights decreased significantly (p less
than 0.01). These findings show that it is safe to administer
undiluted hypertonic elemental diets by constant nasogastric infusion
to patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Avoiding starter
regimens leads to increased nutrient intake and improved nitrogen
balance.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>To determine whether an elemental diet or prednisolone would
be more effective for treating acute Crohn's disease, a controlled
trial was conducted on 20 patients with acute Crohn's disease
who had never received specific treatment. The first ten patients
were put on an elemental diet and the remaining ten were prescribed
prednisolone for six weeks at an initial dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day.
Patients were assessed using the simple activity index, body weight,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and alpha 2
globulin, serum albumin, and radiographic findings of bowel lesions.
At six weeks, the patients on the elemental diet showed a significantly
greater improvement in the activity index, inflammatory signs
such as C-reactive protein and alpha 2 globulin, and radiographic
findings of bowel lesions than did those on the steroid. Patients
who were given steroids for six weeks and then treated with the
elemental diet for four weeks showed improvement in the radiographic
findings of bowel lesions and inflammation. The present study
strongly suggests that elemental diet is superior to steroids
for treating active Crohn's disease.

Treatment was unsuccessful in 17 patients (15%), but there were
no features at the outset of treatment that distinguished these
patients from those who had successful remission. The longterm
outcome of treatment was assessed over a five year period by analysis
of life tables and survival curves. Twenty two per cent of the
patients relapsed within six months of treatment and thereafter
the annual relapse rate was 8-10%. Patients with disease complicated
by fistula or perianal involvement had early relapse, approaching
100% for the latter. A further retrospective comparison of longterm
outcome of diet v steroid induced remissions showed no significant
difference in the relapse rates between the two groups at one,
three, and five years.

<DD>30 patients with active Crohn's disease, mean Crohn's Disease
Activity Index 301 (SE 32), who would otherwise have been treated
with steroids, were randomised to receive for 4 weeks either an
elemental diet ('Vivonex') (n = 16) or a polymeric diet ('Fortison')
(n = 14). Assessment on days 10 and 28 showed that clinical remission
occurred in 5 (36%) of the 14 patients on fortison compared with
12 (75%) of the 16 patients assigned to vivonex. The difference
in remission rate was significant (p less than 0.03). Dietary
treatment resulted in little change in the nutritional state and
various laboratory indices of activity over a 4 week period despite
clinical improvement. Polymeric diets do not seem to offer an
effective therapeutic alternative to elemental diets in patients
with acute exacerbations of Crohn's disease.

<DD>In a randomized multicenter trial the efficacy of treatment
of active Crohn's disease by means of a liquid defined formula
diet (DFD) was tested and compared with a combination of 6-methyl-prednisolone
and sulfasalazine. A total of 95 patients participated in the
study. By the end of 6 weeks, among 44 patients randomized to
drug treatment, 32 showed improvement of the Crohn's disease activity
index (CDAI) as compared with 21 of 51 patients receiving oral
DFD (p less than 0.05). The proportion of withdrawals in the DFD
group (29 of 51) was sevenfold higher than in the drug group (4
of 44). However, most patients (20 of 29) receiving DFD withdrew
because of the unpalatability of the liquid diet. <B>Analysis
of patients in each group who finished the study showed equal
effectiveness of DFD and the drug regimen.</B> In these subsets
of patients the CDAI decreased from 280.8 +/- 90.6 to 151.7 +/-
86.5 (DFD) and from 263.7 +/- 86.3 to 129.3 +/- 63.7 (drug), respectively.
Improvement of inflammation factors was similar in both groups
at the end of the study, although improvement was delayed in the
DFD group. In conclusion, our data show a superiority of the drug
combination over DFD in the treatment of Crohn's disease under
the conditions of this trial. The results do suggest, however,
that DFD offers a therapeutic alternative to prednisolone and
sulfasalazine in a subgroup of patients, which has to be closer
characterized in further studies.<BR>

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>This study examines whether treatment of acute Crohn's disease
with an elemental diet improves intestinal integrity and inflammation
as assessed by a 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid
(EDTA) permeability test and the fecal excretion of 111In-labeled
autologous leukocytes, respectively. Thirty-four patients with
active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with
an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased
intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered
51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%]
and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2%
+/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into
clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment.
After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in
both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less
than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%;
P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just
symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental
diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of
the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears
to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Previous studies have confirmed the therapeutic value of elemental
diets in promoting remission in active Crohn's disease, but their
long-term benefit has not been established. Twenty-seven patients
with established Crohn's disease who attained clinical remission
after four weeks of enteral feeding were followed prospectively
for up to 36 months. Twenty of these were willing to be tested
for specific food intolerance using a pre-defined dietary elimination
protocol; the others continued on a normal unrestricted diet.
Eighteen patients (67%) have since relapsed; 89% of the relapse
occurred within the first 6 months. Of the 15 patients with colonic
involvement, 12 (80%) relapsed by 6 months. In contrast only 3
of 11 with isolated small bowel disease experienced early relapse.
Of the 14 patients who completed the process of dietary testing,
5 could not identify any trigger foods; the remaining 9 were maintained
on exclusion diets, 3 of whom relapsed early. Of the 11 taking
a normal diet, 9 relapsed. Disease duration, previous intestinal
resection or prior steroid therapy did not affect the relapse
rate. Eight patients (31%) obtained a long-term remission, mean
23 months (range 12-36 months), without any medication. Long-lasting
remissions can be obtained in about one-third of patients with
Crohn's disease following treatment with a defined formula diet.
Colonic involvement is associated with a high early relapse rate.

<DD>Four patients with Crohn's disease were treated with an elemental
diet during pregnancy. Two had active disease and two also had
symptoms of small intestinal obstruction. All went into a clinical
remission within a few days of starting treatment. Treatment periods
varied from two to four weeks, and were followed by elemental
diet as a supplement to normal food in two patients. At term,
all delivered a healthy infant. These patients indicate that elemental
diet is a safe form of treatment for Crohn's disease during pregnancy
and may be considered as an alternative to conventional drug treatments
which carry a theoretical risk of teratogenesis.

<DD>Sixteen patients with Crohn's disease who had symptoms uncontrolled
by high-dose steroids (n = 11) or symptoms invariably appearing
on reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy (n = 5)
were treated with elemental diet. After 4 wk of dietary treatment,
10 patients were in remission and off all medication. Seven continued
to be well without treatment for a minimum of 6 months, and four
for at least 1 yr. No patient who subsequently relapsed had further
steroid-refractory symptoms. Of the six patients failing to respond
to elemental diet, four with steroid-refractory disease required
early resective surgery for symptom relief, and two continued
with steroid therapy, one in much reduced dosage. Elemental diet
can bring about a sustained remission in many patients with Crohn's
disease dependent on or refractory to corticosteroids, and reduce
the need for surgical intervention.<BR>

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Although defined formula diets may be useful for initial episodes
of Crohn's disease, the effects of these diets on subsequent attacks
of Crohn's disease or in conjunction with corticosteroids are
unknown. To evaluate these issues, we studied 27 patients in a
randomized prospective trial. Ten patients received only prednisone
(group I), nine received only a defined formula diet (Vital HN
[high nitrogen]) (group II), and eight received a combination
of prednisone and Vital HN (group III). At the time of entry into
the study, the groups were similar with respect to age, sex, Crohn's
Disease Activity Index, previous and current treatments, anatomic
site of disease, and nutritional status. After 1 month of treatment,
we noted seven successes (70%) and three failures in group I (prednisone
only), three successes (33%) and six failures in group II (Vital
HN only), and six successes (75%) and two failures in group III
(combination therapy). Four patients randomized to receive only
Vital HN were unable or unwilling to tolerate the defined formula
diet. Of the five patients who were able to take the defined formula
diet for 1 month, however, three (60%) were successfully treated.
The patients who received prednisone (groups I and III) responded
better than did the patients who received only the defined formula
diet. These results may be attributable to the use of a nonelemental
diet or the treatment of patients who were not experiencing an
initial attack of Crohn's disease or who had previously received
corticosteroids. The expensive and often poorly tolerated defined
formula diets should not be considered as a substitute for standard
therapy with corticosteroids in Crohn's disease.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Growth failure is the most common extraintestinal manifestation
of Crohn's disease in childhood, occurring in up to 50% to 88%
of affected patients. Previous studies have shown malnutrition
to be the most likely cause of the decrease in height and weight
velocities in these children. The purpose of this study was to
determine the effect of an intermittent defined formula diet on
growth and disease activity in children with Crohn's disease and
growth failure. Six Tanner stage I-II patients, mean age 13.6
years with height less than the 5th percentile or height velocity
less than the 3rd percentile were enrolled in a 1-year prospective
study. An isotonic, hydrolyzed whey, medium-chain triglyceride
formula was given by nocturnal nasogastric infusion at a caloric
equivalent of 50th percentile for age, as the exclusive nutrient
source 1 out of 4 months during a 1-year period. A 2-week exclusion
diet and a 2-week low-residue diet followed the defined formula
diet before resuming the regular diet for 2 months. Patients served
as their individual control based on observations of at least
1 year before the study. Height and weight velocity significantly
increased. Prednisone intake significantly decreased, and significant
improvement was seen in disease activity, albumin, and somatomedin
C. The results indicate that an intermittent defined formula diet
can improve growth failure and significantly decrease disease
activity in children with Crohn's disease.<BR>

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>We conducted a population-based case-control study of inflammatory
bowel disease and dietary habits in Stockholm during 1984-1987.
We obtained retrospective information about food intake 5 years
previously by a postal questionnaire for 152 cases with Crohn's
disease, 145 cases with ulcerative colitis, and 305 controls.
The relative risk of Crohn's disease was increased for subjects
who had a high (55 gm or more per day) intake of sucrose (relative
risk = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.4-5.0) and was decreased
for subjects who had a high (15 gm or more per day) intake of
fiber (relative risk = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.3-0.9).
The most striking finding was an increased relative risk of both
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis associated with consumption
of fast foods: the relative risk associated with consumption of
fast foods at least two times a week was estimated at 3.4 (95%
confidence interval = 1.3-9.3) for Crohn's disease and 3.9 (95%
confidence interval = 1.4-10.6) for ulcerative colitis. Although
coffee seemed to provide a protective effect for both diseases,
there are reasons to consider this finding an artifact.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Elemental diet is as effective as corticosteroids in the treatment
of previously untreated Crohn's disease. It is unclear whether
a poor nutritional state is a prerequisite for efficacy of elemental
diet, whether previously treated patients respond as well, or
how duration of remission using elemental diet compares with corticosteroid
induced remission. Forty two patients with active Crohn's disease
were stratified for nutritional state and randomised to receive
Vivonex TEN 2.1 l/day for four weeks, or 0.75 mg prednisolone/kg/day
for two weeks and subsequent reducing doses. Nine of 22 (41%)
patients assigned to nutritional treatment were intolerant of
the diet. Thirty patients completed four weeks treatment. Disease
activity decreased on elemental diet from mean (SEM) 4.8 (0.9)
to 1.7 (0.6), p &lt; 0.05, and on prednisolone from 5.3 (0.5)
to 1.9 (0.6), p &lt; 0.05. For each treatment, nourished and malnourished
patients responded similarly. Patients with longstanding disease
responded as well as newly diagnosed patients. The probability
of maintaining remission at six months was 0.67 after prednisolone,
0.28 after elemental diet, and at one year was 0.35 after prednisolone
and 0.09 after elemental diet, p &lt; 0.05. When tolerated, elemental
diet is as effective in the short term as prednisolone in newly
and previously diagnosed Crohn's disease, and its benefit is independent
of nutritional state. The subsequent relapse rate after elemental
diet induced remission, however, is greater than after treatment
with prednisolone.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Elemental diets are considered an effective primary treatment
for active Crohn's disease. This study examined the hypothesis
that improvement occurs because of the presence of amino acids
or the low fat content, or both. A randomised, controlled trial
was undertaken in 40 patients with active Crohn's disease to evaluate
clinical and nutritional outcomes after an amino acid based diet
containing 3% fat was given by a feeding tube compared with a
peptide based diet containing 33% fat. After three weeks' treatment,
clinical remission occurred in 84% of patients who were given
the amino acid diet and 75% of patients who received the peptide
diet (p = 0.38). Plasma linoleic acid concentration was reduced
after the amino acid but not the peptide diet. An increase in
total body nitrogen was associated with the magnitude of nutritional
depletion before treatment and at six months' follow up, only
patients who showed gains in total body nitrogen after enteral
nutrition had a sustained clinical remission. This study shows
that peptide based high fat diets are as effective as amino acid
low fat diets for achieving clinical remission in active Crohn's
disease. Improved total body protein stores but not essential
fatty acid depletion may be an important indicator of a sustained
remission.<BR>

<DD>Elemental diet is as effective in producing remission of Crohn's
disease (CD) as is corticosteroid treatment, but most patients
relapse soon after resumption of a normal diet. We have investigated
the efficacies of dietary modification and oral corticosteroids
in maintaining remission achieved with elemental diet. In a multicentre
trial, 136 patients with active CD were started on elemental diet
and other treatment was withdrawn. 43 (31%) declined to continue
elemental diet for 14 days, but 78 (84%) of the remaining 93 achieved
remission and were randomly assigned corticosteroids (38) or diet
(40). Corticosteroid treatment started at 40 mg prednisolone daily,
which was tapered and stopped after 12 weeks; that group received
dietary advice on healthy eating. The diet group received &quot;tapered&quot;
placebo and were instructed to introduce one new food daily, excluding
any that precipitated symptoms. Assessment of progress for up
to 2 years was made by physicians unaware of group assignment.
Intention-to-treat analysis showed median lengths of remission
of 3.8 (interquartile range 5.0) months in the corticosteroid
group and 7.5 (15.3) months on diet, and relapse rates at 2 years,
adjusted for withdrawals, of 79% and 62%, respectively (p = 0.048).
Clinical improvement in the diet group was associated with significant
changes in plasma albumin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentrations
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Food intolerances discovered
were predominantly to cereals, dairy products, and yeast. Diet
provides a further therapeutic strategy in active Crohn's disease.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Nineteen children with either newly diagnosed or relapsed
Crohn's disease were enrolled in a randomized study in which the
efficacy of enteral feeding with a whole protein-based formula
was compared to high-dose corticosteroids in achieving clinical
remission and normalization of laboratory measurements. Ten children
were treated by enteral feeding (Nutrison Standard, Nutricia),
and nine received corticosteroids. Both treatment regimens lasted
11 weeks. The activity of Crohn's disease was similar in both
groups before the commencement of the treatment. Clinical symptoms
and signs, as judged by the pediatric Crohn's disease activity
index and measurements relating to inflammatory activity (erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte and platelet
count, and serum immunoglobulins G and A) and to nutritional status
(concentrations of serum albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin) improved
rapidly and significantly with as little as 2 weeks' treatment
in both treatment groups. In both groups, there was one relapse
within 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, and one patient
in both groups was operated on during the treatment period. During
the routine follow-up after the trial (0.3-2.5 years; mean, 1.3
years) five of the corticosteroid group experienced a clinical
relapse, whereas only one from the enteral feeding group relapsed.
No side effects of enteral feeding were seen. Enteral feeding
with a whole protein-based formula proved to be as effective as
high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of the acute phase of
Crohn's disease and may prove to be the treatment of choice in
pediatric patients with acute Crohn's disease.<BR>

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which elemental diets induce
remission in patients with Crohn's disease is unknown, but it
has been suggested that improvement in nutritional state may play
a part. METHODS: We assessed sequential changes in disease activity
(clinical and laboratory indices and faecal excretion of indium-111-labelled
leucocytes) and nutritional status (anthropometry, body composition
variables), hepatic secretory proteins (albumin, pre-albumin,
transferrin), and trace elements (iron, magnesium, copper, zinc)
during treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet.
RESULTS: Disease activity indices improved significantly by 2
weeks and were maintained at 4 weeks of treatment. There was a
significant increase in pre-albumin at 4 weeks and an increase
in serum iron and a decrease in serum copper during the study
period. The changes occurring in the measures of nutrition did
not correlate significantly with the changes in disease activity.
CONCLUSION: The fact that changes in disease activity appear to
precede any detectable changes in nutritional state, it suggests
that the beneficial action of elemental diet in patients with
active Crohn's disease is not due to an improvement in nutritional
status.

<DD>The short- and long-term effects of an elemental diet in children
with acute Crohn's disease were compared with those of prednisolone
in historical controls. Clinical remission was induced in 25 of
30 and in 18 of 28 episodes treated for six weeks with an elemental
diet and prednisolone. Patients with proximal disease had longer
remission after treatment with an elemental diet (p &lt; 0.05)
than did patients with colonic disease after treatment with prednisolone
(p &lt; 0.01). Disease activity index score improved in both groups
compared with the pretreatment scores (p &lt; 0.05). However,
the improvement in the elemental diet group was significantly
better than in the prednisolone group (p &lt; 0.001). Changes
in linear growth were better after treatment with an elemental
diet compared with steroids (p &lt; 0.001). Serum albumin and
haematocrit concentrations all improved significantly in the children
treated with an elemental diet (p &lt; 0.001) but not in those
treated with steroids. Thus an elemental diet was better than
prednisolone in proximal disease and confirmed improved growth
and nutritional status.

<DD>Elemental diets are effective in inducing remission in active
Crohn's disease, but how they exert this therapeutic effect is
unclear. In a previous study a whole protein containing diet proved
less effective than one in which food antigens were excluded,
suggesting that exclusion of food antigens from the gut was a
possible mechanism. This study was designed to test whether an
oligopeptide diet of hydrolysed proteins was as effective as an
amino acid based diet. These diets were equally antigen free but
with different nitrogen sources. Forty four patients with active
Crohn's disease were randomised in a controlled trial of amino
acid versus oligopeptide diet. The feeds were given by nasogastric
tube in equicaloric quantities and were the sole form of nutrition.
Treatment was continued for four weeks although failure to improve
by day 10 resulted in withdrawal. Quantitative leucocyte scintigraphy
was used to investigate the effect of diet treatment on gut inflammation.
Clinical and nutritional responses to treatment were also measured.
Sixteen patients entered remission (including withdrawal of corticosteroids),
six patients could not tolerate the nasogastric tube, and 22 patients
failed to respond. The two diets were equally effective. Patients
who responded had a rapid drop in clinical index of disease activity
and a major reduction in the bowel uptake of leucocytes on scintigraphy.
The oligopeptide and amino acid based enteral feeds were equally
effective at inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. With
both diets clinical improvement was accompanied by a reduction
in intestinal inflammation.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Several studies on enteral nutrition undertaken by our group
led to the following findings: (1) A semielemental diet was as
effective as an elemental diet in inducing remission. (2) A low-residue
diet was useful for the maintenance of remission, with the effect
depending upon the quantity given. (3) Intractability to enteral
nutrition was found in patients with long-standing disease, in
those with severe activity, and in those with colonic disease.
Currently there is insufficient evidence to make specific recommendations
for altering accepted indications for nutritional therapy.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Thirty two patients with active Crohn's disease were included
in a controlled randomised trial to determine the efficacy and
safety of polymeric enteral nutrition compared with steroids,
to achieve and maintain clinical remission. The polymeric diet
was administered through a fine bore nasogastric tube by continuous,
pump assisted infusion (2800 (SEM 120) kcal/day). The steroid
group received 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone. Both treatments were
effective in inducing clinical remission: 15 of the 17 patients
given steroids and 12 of the 15 patients assigned to the polymeric
diet went into clinical remission (defined by a Van Hees index
&lt; 120) within four weeks of treatment. The percentage reduction
of the Van Hees index was 34.8 (4.9)% for steroids and 32.3 (5)%
for enteral nutrition (mean difference 2.5%; 95% CI--11.8% to
+16.8%). Mean time elapsed to achieve remission was similar in
both groups (2.0 (1) v 2.4 (1.2) weeks). Tolerance of the enteral
diet was excellent. Four patients in the steroid group had mild
complications attributable to this treatment. Ten patients (66.6%)
in the steroid group and five (41.6%) in the enteral nutrition
group relapsed within a year of discharge, but no differences
were found in the cumulative probability of relapse during the
follow up period. These results suggest that polymeric enteral
nutrition is as safe and effective as steroids in inducing short
term remission in active Crohn's disease.

<DT><B>Abstract</B>
<DD>Dietary surveys have shown that patients with Crohn's disease
tend to eat more sucrose than control subjects and this investigation
was undertaken to determine whether a diet rich in refined carbohydrate
affects the bacterial flora of the terminal ileum. Ileostomy effluent
in five patients with Crohn's disease and five with ulcerative
colitis after two weeks on a diet rich in sucrose and refined
cereal has been compared with the same period on a diet low in
sucrose and rich in unrefined cereal. Observations were made hourly
for nine hours after equicaloric breakfasts representing the two
diets. The amount of ileostomy effluent was greater on the unrefined
carbohydrate diet both in terms of wet weight (238 +/- 89 g vs
162 +/- 79 g, p less than 0.02) and dry weight (23 X 6 +/- 6.8
g vs 14.9 +/- 6.6 g, p less than 0.01); surprisingly, the amount
of glucose and oligosaccharide was also greater (169 +/- 41 mg
vs 82 +/- 26 mg, p less than 0.001) in all 10 volunteers. The
bacteriological flora per gram was also higher on the unrefined
carbohydrate diet after the test meal (p less than 0.02 between
three and six hours) as a result of a general increase in all
organisms. The relative proportions of the organisms did not vary
between the two diets. No differences were detected between patients
with ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's disease.
