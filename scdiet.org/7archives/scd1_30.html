Is this a more acceptable form of DCCC or the two are about the same?<BR>

Hi Debbie!   I noticed that you were looking at the Breakstones DCCC, I<BR>
hate to say, but NG can't have added liquids to it. Farmers cheese is the<BR>
same thing as DCCC.  Keep on using that as long as it is dry.<BR>

Good Luck!<BR>

Dear Denise,<BR>
The thing that can give me a dull headache and make me feel sort of down,<BR>
is too much sweetness. I usually eat 1/2 of a banana at a time. Or just a<BR>
couple of cookies at a time. I think it must be a blood sugar thing. Have<BR>
you ever noticed the fog tied in with having had a large dose of sweetness?<BR>

In a message dated 97-09-04 21:59:51 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; If you are like me, you have a<BR>
 doctor who refuses to acknowledge the extent of diet in controlling<BR>
 Colitis (and possibly chrones-I have no experience there) and know when<BR>
 you need or don't need meds. Obviously, prednisone needs to be tapered<BR>
 off slowly.  I have found asacol a mixed blessing. When I took 6 tablets<BR>
 a day, I bled.  Now I take only 3 a day (one at  a time) and I believe<BR>
 it helps with the diet, but dosen't give me any bad effects. &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
But it sounds like, given your experience, you still wouldn't advise someone<BR>
to stop all their meds during their first week of the diet?  The thread was<BR>
started by someone who stopped taking their asacol because it contains<BR>
lactose and stopped their questran because it contains sucrose.  They thought<BR>
they were supposed to do these things to be on the diet.  I don't argue with<BR>
anyone making a personal choice as to whether they continue on their<BR>
medications, I just don't want people to feel they have to stop them to be on<BR>
the diet.  <BR>
<BR>
I also don't believe that Elaine was pressured by the medical establishment<BR>
to include her warnings about not stopping medication without a doctors<BR>
advice.  I think she meant it.  She could have just ignored the issue and not<BR>
commented on it if she did not have strong concerns about it.  If she had any<BR>
desire to please the medical establishment she would not have claimed that<BR>
the diet can cure these diseases--that claim is more against the status quo<BR>
than any comment about the need to continue or not continue medication.<BR>

Not only did I not respond to Asacol, but I lost a lot of ground during the<BR>
couple of years I was taking it and almost lost my colon. There is no way<BR>
of knowing if the Asacol was the problem, but I know I don't trust it. I<BR>
stopped taking it almost 4 years ago and haven't needed anything but the<BR>
diet since.<BR>
A pharmacist once told me that he felt people did bettter on Dipentum than<BR>
Asacol. They are supposed to be similar drugs made by different companies. <BR>
Also, there is Azulfadine which has been around for a long time. I was<BR>
under the impression that the newer drugs were supposed to be better, but<BR>
I've heard that Azulfadine has bacteria killing properties that the newer<BR>
ones don't have. Apparently, newer isn't always better. Drug companies have<BR>
been known to bring out a new expensive drug, when the old one's patent has<BR>
run out. Rachel said she took Azulfadine during the first year or so on the<BR>
diet and did well with it. You might ask her about that. <BR>
Let us know how you do.<BR>

Just thought I'd share my experience with that last one, since you all<BR>
are likely to understand.  I just returned from a four-day wedding in<BR>
North-western Washington state.  It was out in the boonies at a resort<BR>
where everything was canned and bottled -- even at this &quot;exclusive&quot;<BR>
restaurant at the resort!  I subsisted on apples, carrots, canned tuna<BR>
and this &quot;gourmet&quot; fresh guacamole sold at this exclusive gourmet<BR>
country store that went for $8.95 a jar!!!  I was so desperate.  The<BR>
hardest part was not actually gettting the food but trying to eat the<BR>
food while I was a bridesmaid and was actively trying to coordinate the<BR>
wedding -- and most of the 4-day weekend's activities were centered<BR>
around food.  The bride had tried to take me into consideration in her<BR>
planning, but, like most people who don't undersatnd the diet, had lots<BR>
of veggie salads with pasta, corn and bottled dressings.  Ughhh.  It was<BR>
hell.  I broke down emotionally (in private, fortunately) at one or two<BR>
points, from exhaustion in general, but also from malnutrition.=20<BR>
Fortunately I have a very understanding husband who was more than there<BR>
for me and helped go buy the guacamole when I was too dizzy to manage.=20<BR>
Sorry, I had to vent all this, it feels like no one else understands how<BR>
difficult it is to stay on this diet sometimes when away from home.=20<BR>
Taking chances on mystery ingredients in restaurants and such.  I came<BR>
home and cooked and cooked and cooked.  And ate and ate and ate! Thanks<BR>
for listening to whomever might be reading this.  It sure helps to talk.<BR>

Hi Denise,<BR>
<BR>
My sympathies go out to you. I can't count how many rain checks I've had =<BR>
to take because of this diet. It's kind of sad for us, but you know how =<BR>
miserable the alternative can be. Hopefully word of this diet will =<BR>
spread exponentially so that more people will become aware of the SCD. =<BR>
I'm sure there are thousands of peolple with our problem that haven't =<BR>
got a clue as to what to do about it. We just need to keep spreading the =<BR>
word. I'm hoping someday that this diet will become popular enough for =<BR>
food manufactures to profit from it so that those of us that don't like =<BR>
to spend so much time in the kitchen can have an easier time of this.<BR>

Sounds like what happens to me is quite different, Lucy.  Although I do<BR>
appreciate your response.<BR>
<BR>
What I get is not associated with eating or not eating, although it<BR>
*sounds* like a low blood sugar thing, so far that hasn't been the<BR>
case.  I eat tons of food, protein and very little fruit or honey. <BR>
Sometimes I wake up with it, sometimes it will hit me during the day.  I<BR>
get spacey and light-headed, and it is hard to concentrate, like I can't<BR>
quite connect with my brain. I'm not necessarily tired when it strikes<BR>
me either.  I've heard of this symptom associated with fibromyalgia,<BR>
although I assume it is somehow related to digestion, assimilation<BR>
problems.  Anybody else suffer from this dang-blasted annoying problem?<BR>

	Dear All,<BR>
                      I can only speak of my own experience , but I took my<BR>
Asacol regularly throughout the first month or two of the diet . Now I take<BR>
it on an as needed basis. That has been around 4 pills over the last 2<BR>
months. This is not a drug like Pred. you do not need to phase off it. But<BR>
the diet certainly helped me within the first seven days even taking the<BR>
Asacol. Just imagine how much less of all those bad things your body is<BR>
already not having to deal with . The small amount of filler added should<BR>
not slow down your progress to much.<BR>
	It may be that you will just take a smidge longer to see results. Stop<BR>
taking it when you do not have the big D. and not until .  Talk to your<BR>
doctor . Mine said it was fine to take it on an as needed basis.<BR>
                                                    Take Care,<BR>

Hi group,<BR>
<BR>
Tim responded to my comments (privately) about aspartame and with<BR>
his permission, I have posted it here.  I thought many others would<BR>
find this information useful.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Hello,<BR>
&gt;  <BR>
&gt; I read one of your postings on the SCD-list (a great list,<BR>
&gt; thanks for being a part of it) that made a reference to Monsanto<BR>
&gt; developing aspartame.  While I in no way wave a flag for it,<BR>
&gt; aspartame was not developed by Monsanto (the poison company).<BR>
&gt; It was developed by G.D.Searle &amp; Company (the Metamucil company),<BR>
&gt; which, after going public with NutraSweet, was purchased by<BR>
&gt; Monsanto and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary.  Monsanto actually<BR>
&gt; led the fight against FDA approval, not for health reasons though,<BR>
&gt; I don't think.  They were the manufacturers of saccharin.<BR>
&gt; Well, well, well.  Pretty much business as usual it seems,<BR>
&gt; even with public health issues.<BR>
&gt;  <BR>
&gt; Again, I'm in no way supporting the massive production and<BR>
&gt; consumption of aspartame, I just thought you might be interested<BR>
&gt; in this bit of corporate history.  Oh, and by the way, aspartame<BR>
&gt; had been rejected many times by the FDA but was finally approved<BR>
&gt; while Reagan was president.  Reagan had a buddy/strong political<BR>
&gt; supporter named Donald Rumsfeld (sp.) who happened to be<BR>
&gt; president/CEO of ... G.D.Searle &amp; Company.  (But I'm sure that<BR>
&gt; had nothing to do with anything.)<BR>
&gt;  <BR>
&gt; Here's to honey.<BR>
&gt;  <BR>
&gt; Hope all is well with you,<BR>
&gt;  <BR>
&gt; Tim<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

&lt;&lt;  Sometimes though, when I feel<BR>
 depressed, I realize what I mostly am is tired.  That is the biggest<BR>
 drag, is dealing with low energy.  I personally feel that half the time<BR>
 people talk about depression, it's really deep, &quot;bone level&quot; fatigue. <BR>
 Don't get me wrong, though, I'm not saying all depression is this.  I<BR>
 just mean sometimes it's hard to figure it out. &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I agree.  When I get depressed, a couple of good night's sleep makes a big<BR>
difference in my outlook.  I don't have any reserves these days so it is too<BR>
easy to get pushed over the edge and exhausted without really realizing it.<BR>
 I think that was the source of my problem this time.<BR>

Hi again,<BR>
<BR>
I'll just mention this again as there seem to be more and more concern <BR>
about Asacol surfacing. I've had serious problems with Asacol in the past <BR>
(as recently as two weeks ago), the more I used the worse I felt. I am <BR>
now using NOVO-5 ASA from NOVOPHARM  and as I'm weaning off Prednisone, I <BR>
have tried a little extra NOVO-5 when symptoms reoccur -- it seems to <BR>
work fine without the discomfort and increase in symptoms. It's a generic <BR>
form of Asacol made without lactose. Your pharmacist should be able to <BR>
get you a product profile(to screen for lactose) if there is another <BR>
generic brand available in your area.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,<BR>
Neil<BR>

&lt;&lt; Also, there is Azulfadine which has been around for a long time. I was<BR>
 under the impression that the newer drugs were supposed to be better, but<BR>
 I've heard that Azulfadine has bacteria killing properties that the newer<BR>
 ones don't have. Apparently, newer isn't always better. &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Azulfadine does have bacteria killing properties that Asacol does not.<BR>
 Azulfadine is in a sulfa base and sulfa has antibiotic-like properties.<BR>
 Asacol was developed to deliver the active ingredient without the sulfa base<BR>
because many are allergic to sulfa (personally, sulfa makes me nauseous).  I<BR>
believe Bactrim is an example of a broad-base sulfa drug in common use.  They<BR>
work better than antibiotics for certain types of things and I think, as a<BR>
class, were a precursor to antibiotics.  I don't know how the sulfa base<BR>
works with the active ingredient though and whether you actually get the<BR>
benefit of the sulfa by taking it (it may be that the sulfa was used as a<BR>
delivery mechanism, like the enteric coating on asacol--to get it past your<BR>
stomach and dissolving in the ph of the bowel).<BR>

You know, fasting for a day works wonders for your system.  Especially<BR>
if you gear yourself up for it psychologically, you will find that you<BR>
can easily make it through the day.  It works as a last resort.  Even<BR>
three days is doable (I've done it) and the first day is the hardest. Or<BR>

&gt; &gt;I was thinking just the other day about how I'm<BR>
&gt; &gt;going to handle our annual corporate retreat.  All the executives go<BR>
&gt; off<BR>
&gt; &gt;together for 3 days.  All of our time is scheduled in various group<BR>
&gt; &gt;activities and two big activities are eating and drinking.  Dinner<BR>
&gt; menus are<BR>
&gt; &gt;preplanned--no choices<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; This is true, it's not easy.  My office had a retreat planned and I<BR>
&gt; think I got<BR>
&gt; so stressed out worrying about it that it caused a flare.  I had heard<BR>
&gt; that the<BR>
&gt; menus were all pre-ordered with little choice and that usually people<BR>
&gt; go out<BR>
&gt; drinking and socializing and what not.  This made me even more<BR>
&gt; aprehensive.  I<BR>
&gt; had planned to go and bring my own food in a cooler.  I called the<BR>
&gt; hotel and<BR>
&gt; requested a mini fridge in  my room.  I was just going to eat cold<BR>
&gt; food and<BR>
&gt; deal with it.  It was only going to be 2 days.  Finally I felt so sick<BR>
&gt; that I<BR>
&gt; told my boss I had to stay behind because I wasn't feeling well and<BR>
&gt; didn't want<BR>
&gt; to be far from home.  I kept going to work, but didn't participate in<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; retreat.  I hope that I can go the next time.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;PS.  How do others deal with these kinds of situations?  How do you<BR>
&gt; prevent<BR>
&gt; &gt;well meaning people from poisening you? ;-)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; It's hard.  I told my friend's mother about it in detail, yet when I<BR>
&gt; went for<BR>
&gt; dinner, she thought she was so good at adhering to my diet but she<BR>
&gt; used bottled<BR>
&gt; barbeque sauce on the bbq ribs and the vegies were cooked crispy, when<BR>
&gt; I need<BR>
&gt; them well done.  I ate it anyway, because I didn't want to be rude or<BR>
&gt; make a<BR>
&gt; scene.  So, it's not easy, but it can be done.  I think if I had<BR>
&gt; spoken to her<BR>
&gt; ahead of time and found out what she was making I could have told her<BR>
&gt; not to<BR>
&gt; put any sauce on mine and that I need my vegies boiled.  We need to be<BR>
&gt; more<BR>

In a message dated 97-09-05 03:52:23 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Drug companies have<BR>
 been known to bring out a new expensive drug, when the old one's patent has<BR>
 run out &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
This could happen but it would be an accident of timing.  The full drug<BR>
development cycle takes 10-12 years and costs about $400 million.  It would<BR>
be difficult to time the events to work out this way, and of little advantage<BR>
to the pharma company.<BR>
<BR>
Providing the same active ingredient in a different base is a way to leverage<BR>
the time and cost of development if it offers a way to broaden their existing<BR>
market. (For example, percodan and percocet)  If they can get them both out,<BR>
under patent, at the same time then they will, because it will expand their<BR>
overall marketplace and they seek to establish a firm hold on that<BR>
marketplace during the patent period.  Once a drug goes off patent, the<BR>
generics erode 66% of the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
A drug company would not hold an approved product off the market waiting for<BR>
any specific event.  The patent clock on that product is already running when<BR>
they go into the FDA approval process.  Each day on the market within patent<BR>
can mean $1 Million in revenue to them so they rush their products to market.<BR>
<BR>
One other interesting aside to all this is that the generic versions are<BR>
often in a different base and this can affect one's tolerance of the drug.  A<BR>
friend of mine had a reaction to the generic equivalent of Elavil, but the<BR>
doctor may try her on the original product since it is in a different base.<BR>
 Asacol and Asulfazine are the same active ingredient in two completely<BR>
different bases.  Asacol is more often prescribed these days since many<BR>
cannot tolerate the sulfa base in Asulfazine, but there are probably those<BR>
who are better served by the sulfa formulation.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, the good news in all this is that the IBD community provides a<BR>
reasonable marketplace--about 2 million of us in the US marketplace.  This<BR>
means that it is cost effective for companies to seek approval of products<BR>
for our indications.  The government has &quot;Orphan&quot; drug programs to try to<BR>
incentivize industry to produce products for the small markets but it is<BR>
still a difficult thing to make a business case for.  <BR>
<BR>
Oh, one final comment.  Don't imagine that the pharma companies are out there<BR>
doing original research seeking a cure for IBD.  If they find a cure it will<BR>
merely be the side effect of their research.  They seek patentable chemical<BR>
combinations and then seek to apply them to a indication with a reasonable<BR>
marketplace.  Rogaine was originally intented as a heart medication but<BR>
failed to show efficacy.  The patches had the side effect of growing hair and<BR>
that's how they ended up using it for that.  If you believe there should be<BR>
more basic research into the cause and cure for IBD you should financially<BR>
support organizations like CCFA--they fund basic research into IBD.<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;970905145417_1145177954@emout18.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Awhile ago, Barb Partridge posted the recipe below as a solution to the soggy<BR>
carrot cake dilemma.  I just tried it and had terrific results.  Folding in<BR>
the beaten egg whites adds air and provides a structure for it so it stays<BR>
light (like merinque).  I didn't have the orange rind or frozen orange juice<BR>
(but now I'm ready to buy them special to make it again).  I substituted<BR>
lemon rind and lemon juice--which was good--but the lemon juice wasn't a<BR>
strong enough substitute for the concentrated juice (I wish now I'd thought<BR>
to toss in a tsp of orange extract with the lemon juice).  Anyway, I made<BR>
mine in a muffin tin.  Just heap it in there--they won't rise higher in the<BR>
oven--and watch your baking time.  It's much shorter with the muffin tins.  I<BR>
froze mine and have been enjoying them out of the freezer--they freeze well.<BR>
 Given that they include no leavening, I think they are even kosher for<BR>
passover. You don't need the springform pan to enjoy this recipe but you do<BR>
need a mixer (it would be very difficult to beat the egg whites by hand to<BR>
stiff peaks).  The flavor is more like a light orange bread than carrot.  The<BR>
carrots offer a lovely color and lots of nutrition but don't dominate the<BR>
flavor at all.  When I first read the recipe, I considered adding raisens<BR>
(thinking carrot cake) but now I'm glad I didn't.  If I added something, it<BR>
might be a little coconut as a variation.<BR>

Carrot Cake<BR>
6 eggs, seperated<BR>
1 cup honey<BR>
1 1/2 cups carrots, cooked and pureed<BR>
1 Tlbs grated orange rind<BR>
1 Tlbs frozen orange juice<BR>
3 cups almond flour<BR>
Preheat over to 325<BR>
Beat the egg yolks and honey together. Mix in carrot puree, orange rind,<BR>
orange juice and almond flour. Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold in.<BR>
Spoon into a greased loose bottomed 9 inch springform pan. Bake for about<BR>
50 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out<BR>
clean. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool<BR>
completely. This cake looks great , tastes wonderful alone but it is<BR>
also very nice served with the Honey Cream Whipped Topping (Page 110 ,<BR>
Breaking the Vicious Cycle).<BR>
The carrots should be cooked, pureed then measured. If I have a bit left over<BR>
I just use it in soup. Yes I have made the carrot cake in the book but<BR>
like you found it somewhat soggy. The recipe for the carrot cake with the<BR>
pureed carrots in not soggy at all, like I said it is more like a cake<BR>
texture,<BR>
moist, and can actually be sliced and served, which is most difficult with<BR>
the<BR>
carrot cake in the book. The whole family really enjoyed it.<BR>

Hi Everyone,<BR>

What does everyone do to help them gain weight.  I am 95 pounds and am<BR>
struggling to gain weight and maintain my weight for that matter.  Any<BR>
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I have tried everything I could<BR>
possibly think of which are in the boundaries of the diet.  Would love to<BR>

If I tried to fast for a day at this point, I would probably pass out or<BR>
at the very lest feel extremely weak!  If I let my hunger deficit get<BR>
too bad, it can take me hours, sometimes days to recover.  Glad to hear<BR>
it works for you though.  It would be a great convenience if I could<BR>
just &quot;not eat,&quot; as I've actually tried to do out of desperation<BR>
sometimes, with rather unfortunate results!  We're all different, I<BR>
guess.<BR>

&gt; You know, fasting for a day works wonders for your system.  Especially<BR>

Hello Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Since the summer, when I've had to eat out a lot, I've realized that<BR>
wait-persons and restaurants can be fairly flexible.  For example, I ask for<BR>
salads without dressing, croutons or cheese, and even if it is a fixed<BR>
dinner, the person who serves is usually able to serve the salad plain.  And<BR>
I ask for main courses-chicken,beef,fish, to be served plain without sauces,<BR>
and vegetables too. Even at a fixed-menu event the sauces are often added<BR>
near the table and can be left off. If the vegetables are not allowed, I've<BR>
even asked if there are any other vegetables available and there often are.<BR>
Sometimes, if there seems to be a person in charge of the meal at a group<BR>
event, I have talked to that person at the beginning of the meal, told<BR>
her/him my dietary constraints and asked for help.  <BR>
<BR>
If possible I bring along my own salad dressing in a small container and<BR>
when I travel I bring along nut muffins -which can last up to 10 days<BR>
without refrigeration.  And then I bring snacks for in-between, like nuts<BR>
and fruit.  I think breakfasts are the hardest to eat with a group because<BR>
they rarely serve eggs (my staple) or plain fruits, so I usually try to eat<BR>
that on my own. If it's all breads and muffins, I bring my own.<BR>
<BR>
I imagined when I began all this that people around me would think I'm a<BR>
curiosity, and ask lots of snoopy questions, but they don't.  They might<BR>
say, &quot;Oh are you on  a diet?&quot;  and then I say yes for a stomach inflammation<BR>
and that usually ends it. The biggest hurdle for me has been all the sadness<BR>
I feel inside when I see people eat foods I can no longer eat.  I try to<BR>
give myself a few moments of sadness and then join in the conversation which<BR>
helps end it.<BR>
<BR>
Best to all<BR>
<BR>

 	Dear All ,<BR>
                     Yes, yes Roberta, I love to eat out and have never had<BR>
a problem in fact I think it is easier. Restaurants are very cooperative<BR>
with me especially when you say a health related condition is the reason.<BR>
You can not dine at fast food places but you sure can find plenty at family<BR>
type or fancy places. Even Denny's or Perkins are more than cooperative .<BR>
They have been very happy to supply me with fruit instead of toast or  hash<BR>
browns.<BR>
	I encourage all of you to get out there and ask, I think you will be<BR>
pleasantly surprised at how helpful restaurants can be.  I have a couple<BR>
that automatically know not to even bring me bread or croutons on the salad<BR>
etc.<BR>
	Be brave ask.<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;970905194426_-299781576@emout19.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Tonight I tried making peanut butter cookies based on the recipe in Elaine's<BR>
book and the foreknowledge from this list that they tend to spread out too<BR>
much on the cookie sheet.  I left out the butter (between the peanut butter<BR>
and almond flour there's plenty of oil), and doubled the baking soda to 1/2<BR>
tsp.  When I tasted the batter (yes, I risked my life for you guys!) I<BR>
realized that they needed salt (my peanut butter literally has nothing else<BR>
in it).  I added 1/2 tsp salt and that made a big difference.  When I baked<BR>
them, they came out light and fluffy.  In fact, the next time I make them I<BR>
will probably eliminate the butter, add the salt, and leave the baking soda<BR>
alone.<BR>
<BR>
I hope someone finds this helpful.<BR>

I rely on avocados!  For me, these are super food, somehow seem really<BR>
easy to digest and have a high vegetable fat content.  I add them to<BR>
everything I eat.  Unfortunately, since we have to work so hard to get<BR>
carbs in on the SCD, I rely on fats to pack in more calories.  Also<BR>
though, make sure you are getting as much carbs as possible.  Lately<BR>
I've been eating A LOT of split peas soup.  I'm not sure where you are<BR>
at with the diet in terms of what foods you can and can't eat.  If you<BR>
can handle the cookie recipes, they are a fantastic source of carbs and<BR>
calories as well.<BR>
<BR>

Hi, my name is JoEllen and I am a new participant! I have been enjoying the<BR>
postings that I have been receiving. I have learned so much and it is nice to<BR>
have people to share this with.  Lucky for me, I found out about Elaine's<BR>
book about a month ago.  I have been on the diet for about 3 weeks and I can<BR>
hardly believe the difference it has made!  Who would have thought that<BR>
giving up wheat, yeast, starch, sugar, etc. would make such a difference.  I<BR>
must admit that I haven't made any yohurt yet. I am a bit sceptical. I did<BR>
locate some &quot;Dry Curd Nonfat Cottage Cheese&quot; made by the Louis Trauth Dairy<BR>
in Newport, KY.  The ingred. include: Grade A Pasteurized Cultured SKim Milk,<BR>
Grade A, Non Fat Dry Milk. I hope this is the correct form.  (It is<BR>
definitely DRY). I have CD and had a resection about 4 years ago. I have<BR>
trouble with Diarrhea and have been on the full dosage of Pentasa for over a<BR>
year.  I also take vitamins and herbs (UC3J, Marshmellow and Psyllium). Since<BR>
being on the diet, I no longer have D and have been enjoying fruits,<BR>
vegetables, cheese!  I was wondering if any of you have difficulty being on<BR>
the diet and cooking for a family.  I guess I need to use some imagination.<BR>
 I certainly have also enjoyed the recipes you people share.  Would love a<BR>
copy of the soup you liked so much and any others.  I hope to now be an<BR>
active participant  and won't sit back and be silent.  Thanks to all of you<BR>
for your support and for being out there.  JoEllen<BR>
<BR>
P.S. On Sunday we are going out to dinner to celebrate my son's birthday. I<BR>
will let you know how it goes.<BR>

Hi Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
This recipe appeared in the paper yesterday and I tried it<BR>
today...wonderful.  I added pieces of left-over chicken when I added the<BR>
yogurt.<BR>
<BR>
Zucchini Soup with Cinnamon, Cumin and Yogurt<BR>
<BR>
1 pound trimmed zucchini<BR>
3 cups or so chicken stock<BR>
1 tbsp. butter<BR>
2/3 cup chopped onion<BR>
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<BR>
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<BR>
1/2 cup homemade yogurt<BR>
minced fresh cilentro (I used dried)<BR>
salt to taste<BR>
lime or lemon wedges if served cold<BR>
<BR>
Chop zucchini in large chunks and put in small soup pot.  Add chicken<BR>
broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer, covered, about 10 minutes<BR>
(until zucchini are very tender.)<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, heat butter in a small, non-stick frying pan. Add onion, cumin<BR>
and cinnamon, and saute until onion is soft and spices are fragrant.<BR>
<BR>
Put both mixtures into a food processor or blender.  Puree until smooth,<BR>
but do not sieve.  Add yogurt (and chicken, if desired).  Serve hot or<BR>
chilled, sprinkled with cilentro, if use fresh.  If use dried, put in with<BR>
cumin and cinnamon when sauteeing onion.  May wait to add salt at table,<BR>
individually.<BR>
<BR>
Serves 4 as a first course, or 2 as an entree.<BR>
<BR>
Bon appitit!<BR>

  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I wasn't aware that the CCFA had &quot;rejected&quot; the SCD.  I thought it was<BR>
generally accepted that diet influences the symptoms of IBD.  As I understand<BR>
it, the only major point on which Elaine and the establishment differ is the<BR>
question of whether the diet cures the disease and I think this is a matter<BR>
of semantics.  If the diet can make us symptom-free then we perceive it as a<BR>
cure, yet we all know that it may not be gone forever.  Personally, I'm<BR>
thrilled with the results I've gotten with the SCD.  It's made a huge<BR>
difference for me in only a short time.  On the other hand,  I'd rather the<BR>
true causes of this disease be understood and resolved.  I'd rather live in a<BR>
world where children don't suffer with this--at all, not for a minute.  I<BR>
hope for a future where IBD, like polio, is better known as a childhood<BR>
vaccine than a disease.  Biotechnology is advancing rapidly.  The pieces to<BR>
the overall puzzle of human physiology are being figured out.  I want there<BR>
to be researchers pulling those pieces together to figure out how to<BR>
eradicate IBD.  <BR>
<BR>
From my observations, I'm glad the CCFA exists and I support their mission.<BR>
 They provide a lot of outreach and support services, as well as fund<BR>
research.  I may or may not agree with how they select grantees, how they<BR>
allocate their funds across programs, etc. but I support their work and<BR>
recognize that they are working hard to do a responsible job with a difficult<BR>
mission and limited funds.  <BR>
<BR>
Despite the fact that I didn't have a choice about joining the IBD community,<BR>
now that I'm here, I feel impelled to contribute as I can to the community.<BR>
 A lot of people helped me through my early dark months with this<BR>
disease--many from the crohns-colitis bulletin board.  I try to stop by and<BR>
write answers to basic questions in order to give back some of the early<BR>
support I received.  I offer support by phone and email to various people in<BR>
my area who know me through friends of friends.  I'm the only executive in my<BR>
company who is publicly, chronically ill.  I offer mentorship and support to<BR>
employees in a similar situation, and am working to change many of the<BR>
company policies to better support people with chronic illnesses.  I'm not<BR>
strong enough to participate in the CCFA walk-a-thon, but several of my staff<BR>
do and I contribute money because that is what I can do.  <BR>
<BR>
So I'll just say that I would encourage each person to be a fully active<BR>
member of the IBD community in whatever ways you are able (whether you choose<BR>
to support CCFA or not).  The support you offer on this list is obviously one<BR>
aspect of that.   If the diet approach is the solution you wish to support<BR>
you could contact the CCFA and ask whether they would be willing to locate<BR>
and fund a grantee to validate the beneficial effects of the SCD if we are<BR>
able to raise enough money for such a venture.  Checks could be designated<BR>
toward that purpose.  Perhaps that is too ambitious as an initial venture.<BR>
 Maybe just ask whether they would be willing to publish an informational<BR>
brochure on the diet and provide it to newbies who contact them for<BR>
information.  I'm merely advocating that everyone should not only take care<BR>
of themselves, but also take action to support the broader IBD community (I'm<BR>
sure many of you already do this in various ways).  Whatever approach or<BR>
organization you believe in--support it in some way.  For me, offering<BR>
support to others redeems my experience with this disease--makes it<BR>
worthwhile, and giving financial support to CCFA allows me to feel that I am<BR>
doing what I can toward a cure.  I believe that, as a group, we can improve<BR>
the quality of life for all of us.<BR>

I just ordered a new box of almond flour from Hughsons (via email--Thanks<BR>
Dan!) and they told me that &quot;Due to the increased demand for the almond flour<BR>
we have lowered our cost to $3.25 a pound.&quot;  I thought this was such good<BR>
news, that I'd pass it on.  (My order came to a total of $96 for 25lbs<BR>

Dear Ellen,<BR>
How I wish it were true that CCFA in any way supported the SCD. You're<BR>
right, the IBD community should be united in finding a cure for this<BR>
horrible disease. Unfortunately, unless things have changed drastically<BR>
since I was last involved in CCFA ( I also stopped supporting them some<BR>
time back), their last stance that I was aware of, involving the diet was<BR>
that it lacked scientific basis and that they would neither support or help<BR>
to promote the SCD. All the scientific proof I've ever needed was the<BR>
healing I found by following the diet. If you've seen evidense that CCFA<BR>
has in any way changed their position in this please let me know.<BR>
Thanks, Rachel<BR>

Today I was shopping at the mall with my daughter and I was famished!  I<BR>
thought, now what can I eat that is legal on the diet!  At the food court is<BR>
a place called<BR>
&quot;Frullati Cafe&quot;.  They have fruit drinks.  I thought well, it doesn't hurt to<BR>
ask. And to my surprise they had a drink that I could drink!  They just blend<BR>
together a banana and fresh orange juice (I saw them squeeze it) and blended<BR>
it with ice.!  It was really good and I thought I would pass this on to all<BR>
of you.  Keep the helpful informtion coming......JoEllen<BR>

<BR>
  I've wondered if it isn't related to the yogurt somehow.  I've been<BR>
cutting back on it, from four or five big servings a day to three small<BR>
ones.  I missed the conversation on people who might not tolerate the<BR>
yogurt well.  Is there a group experimenting with this?  Thanks.  Carolyn<BR>

<BR>
you write that you eat tons of food, protein and very little fruit and<BR>
honey; I am wondering if your &quot;brain fog&quot; could come from not enough carbs?<BR>
On this diet, we do have to really take care that we are getting<BR>
enough...I don't think I do sometimes and am considering eating squash or<BR>
zucchini, etc. for breakfast in addition to the yogurt and dry curd cottage<BR>
combination, since I, too, can't tolerate much honey and very little fruit<BR>
at this point (almost 3 mos. on diet).<BR>
I think I'll run an experiment for the next week and have at least one<BR>
vegetable high in carbs for breakfast in addition to my usual, and see if<BR>
my &quot;light headedness&quot; and propensity to lie down a lot decreases!  Also,<BR>
the past 10 days or so, I have been having dull headaches!<BR>
<BR>
Will let you know if things change after having the added carbs for breakfast.<BR>

&gt;Dear Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
I made the yogurt yesterday the way you explained your method (in the<BR>
electric oven, using only the light bulb for warming the yogurt) and it<BR>
works great!  Only problem, I also had to prop the door open, because it<BR>
was heating up too much; but then I found that even with the tiniest thing<BR>
in my kitchen being used as a wedge to hold the door open, too much heat<BR>
was escaping and the thermometer (mouth) dropped below 100...so, I covered<BR>
the door with a beach towel and stuck masking tape on the counter top and<BR>
oven top to hold the heat...I kept checking it and it stayed at 106 degrees<BR>
without moving!  A friend came over and saw my oven section of my stove<BR>
covered with a beach towel and was sure I'd &quot;gone over the edge!&quot;  Isn't<BR>
this fun?<BR>
<BR>
Any ideas how to keep the heat in without cozying the oven?<BR>
<BR>

Dear Prateeksha,<BR>
Thanks for a great laugh. All you needed was one of those visor things<BR>
taped to the oven door, that people use for tanning and you could have made<BR>
up a great story about experimenting with indoor tanning.<BR>
Try a lower wattage light bulb (60-75 watts) and see if that helps. I'm so<BR>
glad your yogurt came out great. I don't think anything beats this process<BR>
for large amounts of delicious yogurt.<BR>

Hello brain fog friends.  It's comforting to know there are a few others<BR>
who know what I am referring to!  In the last few days I've been trying<BR>
something my husband recommended to me that seems to be helping.  I say<BR>
seems, because although it *has* been helping, it's too soon to say it's<BR>
because of what I've been doing or coincidence, but I'm ready to share. <BR>
My husband (who is in the medical field) had the idea that I could<BR>
possible have a mineral deficiency because of my absorbtion problems<BR>
(re: IBS) and because I get the brain-fog, which seems to mimic<BR>
low-blood sugar swings in spite of eating a lot of food (by the way<BR>
Prateeksha, thanks for the carbs reminder.  I try to eat lots of split<BR>
pea soup and lima beans, apples, seem to get enough carbs).  I've been<BR>
taking a mineral supplement that seems to have stabilized my energy<BR>
levels and the brain fog has been non-existent since I started to take<BR>
them (for the last four days, which is significant for me).  If you want<BR>
to try, make sure you get a calcium-magnesium supplement that is calcium<BR>
and magnesium *citrate,* not carbonate.  This is apparently very<BR>
important because the citrate comes from vegetable sources and is much<BR>
easier to absorb by the body.  I used to take Calc./Mag. supplements but<BR>
never noticed a difference until I took the citrate form.  I hope this<BR>
info. helps someone else too and I wish us all luck in figuring this<BR>
problem out. <BR>

Hi JoEllen,<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to the group and thanks for the tip!  I tried doing the fruit<BR>
smoothie thing at the mall recently and had a problem with the bananas<BR>
not being as ripe as we are supposed to have them (with black spots on<BR>
them, no trace of green).  It sure would be great to have a thing to be<BR>
able to eat at the mall!<BR>

I'm not sure if the CCFA supports the diet or not, but earlier in the <BR>
year the Chrohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada printed a review of <BR>
Elaine's book in their monthly newsletter.  I think I still have this <BR>
article in the form of a write document somewhere if anyone is <BR>
interested in reading it.<BR>
My impression of the article was that they felt more scientific research <BR>
was needed before they could recommend the diet because they felt there <BR>
were holes in Elaine's theory but they didn't say anything about putting <BR>
forward the money to fund this research.  If it doesn't come from them, <BR>
where else could it possibly come from??<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

hi<BR>
<BR>
it's a lame excuse for CCFA to say they won't spend any money for<BR>
reseaching the SCD diet just because they think there are holes in<BR>
Elaine's theory, the drug companies dont know how most of the medicines<BR>
that are in use actually work, including the asacol my son takes, they<BR>
may have an educated guess, but they still don't know for sure.<BR>
<BR>
and if the theory is wrong but the diet works, that's enough for<BR>
for me, although i would welcome the knowledge of how it works since<BR>
that could lead to an improvement in the treatment of IBD diseases.<BR>
<BR>
finally, the SCD diet doesn't have to work for 100% of all IBD sufferers<BR>
to be recommended, asacol comes with information on<BR>
two trial studies, one in which 49% of those taking asacol were <BR>
helped, and another in which 74% were helped. no drug or therapy<BR>
is 100%.<BR>
<BR>
i am going to write my congressman and my two senators and urge<BR>
them to set aside a small sum of money to research this diet. perhaps<BR>
a large HMO would be interested since this disease must be costing a<BR>
lot of money, perhaps a foundation could help. i know one 60,000 <BR>
patient HMO has recently completed a study on using the ZONE diet<BR>
to treat diabetics, they hope to save some bucks, the news will be<BR>
out this october i think, perhaps they would be interested in<BR>
doing a similar study with SCD. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
i have been looking at PubMed for articles on colitis and have found two<BR>
that i would like to hear from the rest of you on. one study in japan<BR>
found that a western style diet, specifically margarine and bread, was a<BR>
big factor in IBD in japan (i dont know the extent of IBD in Japan)<BR>
the second study, published in 1979, recommended chelation therapy for<BR>
sufferers of colitis due to patients having excessive levels of copper<BR>
in their livers and there was a specific chemical (not copper) that<BR>
was an indicator. i  have read a lot about chelation only because my<BR>
wife was on her way to heart problems (her mom died of it, her two oldest<BR>
brothers died of it in their forties etc...) of course now our biggest<BR>
concern is our son's colitis. <BR>
<BR>
finally, i am struck by the number of IBD sufferers that get auto-<BR>
immune type diseases too. perhaps those at CCFA think that colitis is<BR>
an auto-immune disease, if fact after my son's diagnosis with colitis<BR>
my ex-boss told me he had colitis too, and that his brother has lupus, an<BR>
auto-immune disease. he told me that it so happens that in austin texas<BR>
where we live there is one of two doctors treating lupus with diet and<BR>
other alternative therapies and getting success. i plan to pursue<BR>
this lead.<BR>

 Hi All,<BR>
<BR>
  Question...does anyone else hear their knees crack? What does this mean?<BR>
I also have had joint pain in my thumb at times.  I know this is related to<BR>
my diet, perhaps to lack of vitamins and/or minerals.  Yes, I am taking my<BR>
vitamins.  But everytime I try to take the minerals I react to the honey, I<BR>
think.  Also, my doctor gave me an awful time when I wanted a B12 shot to<BR>
boost me into the high-normal range as Elaine suggested.  She said she<BR>
would do it only once.  So I did it once (after testing in normal range)<BR>
and haven't been back in eight months.  Thanks.<BR>

Hi Prateeksha,<BR>
  I think eating enough (specific) carbohydrates are a challenge for me,<BR>
but I don't tolerate them well.<BR>
<BR>
  When I first started the diet I could hardly keep -any- food in me and<BR>
was losing weight like crazy.  When I got really desparate, read the<BR>
beginning diet instructions over again and started over, it became a long,<BR>
patient, effort just to keep my tummy from rumbling, maintain my energy,<BR>
and keep me from getting D. (which I am still working on), etc.<BR>
<BR>
  I've introduced fruits very slowly, and just can't seem to tolerate them<BR>
yet.  Same with very much variation on vegetables.  I still suspect honey,<BR>
although I am doing ok with it in almond bread.  Even eggs give me D.<BR>
Cheese is still a problem.  Has anyone else been this sensitive for this<BR>
long? or is it just me?  I am much, much better.  My reactions seem to be<BR>
less severe, which I take to be an improvement, and a matter of time before<BR>
my system can handle it.<BR>
<BR>
  I eat butternut squash and hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I<BR>
vary it with chicken, fish, zucchini, raw tomatoes, avacado, cooked apple,<BR>
yogurt, almond bread (made with apple and butternut squash).<BR>
<BR>
 I've been on the diet (almost properly) for about eight months and can't<BR>
quite shake the D. in the AM.  Some days are better than others.  Gets<BR>
worse, apparently during menstruation.<BR>
<BR>
  I'd be interested in specific carbohydrate tips, too.  Maybe I should try<BR>
eating butternut squash for a snack.  Not very appetizing sounding, but it<BR>
might be worth a try. Recipe anyone?<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes,  Carolyn<BR>

&lt;&lt; My impression of the article was that they felt more scientific research <BR>
 was needed before they could recommend the diet because they felt there <BR>
 were holes in Elaine's theory but they didn't say anything about putting <BR>
 forward the money to fund this research.  If it doesn't come from them, <BR>
 where else could it possibly come from??<BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
It could come from designated contributions made by those who believe in the<BR>
diet.  Of course, this assumes that there is a researcher who proposes to<BR>
validate Elaine's findings, but perhaps CCFA knows of someone with this<BR>
interest.  I believe there are about 200 people on this diet (or at least<BR>
there are about 200 people calling Hughson's for almond flour for this diet).<BR>
 If everyone chipped in $100 that would be $20,000.  If CCFA was willing to<BR>
match those contributions out of their general fund, then it starts to add<BR>
up.  In fact, maybe Elaine would be willing to be a major contributor since<BR>
she would stand to benefit from the validation of the diet's success.<BR>
<BR>
I like the point that someone else made pointing out that large HMOs stand to<BR>
benefit from a validation of a diet approach to treatment of IBD.  They could<BR>
save a lot of money.  Maybe they'd be willing to match our funds as well<BR>
(they would therefore pay 50% of the costs, but the actual cost to them would<BR>
be much less.)  In addition, there are some government grant programs that<BR>
are willing to match funds raised in the private sector.<BR>
<BR>
If all of this worked out, we'd have a $200,000 study.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not arguing that this is the optimum way to go about this.  I'm just<BR>
trying to point out that even a small group of people can make big things<BR>
happen.  <BR>

Subject: Tzatziki<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;970907223727_2084139069@emout01.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Tzatziki is the yogurt based sauce that is served on gyro sandwiches.  It's<BR>
highly versatile.  I made some to serve with lamb chops, and then used the<BR>
remainder as a salad dressing.  If you cut the cucumber in slices instead of<BR>
small pieces, it would be a nice cucumber salad in and of itself.  I've also<BR>
seen it served as a cold cucumber soup.<BR>
<BR>
Fresh dill makes all the difference in my view.  If you are wondering what to<BR>
do with the rest of it, use it on poached salmon or toss it in with zuchinni<BR>
sauted with onions.<BR>
<BR>
Tzatziki<BR>
<BR>
3/4 cup yogurt or yogurt cheese<BR>
2/3 cup peeled, seeded, cucumber (you can grate it, slice it, mince it,<BR>
depending on the end result you are seeking!)<BR>
1/2 small onion--thinly sliced<BR>
1/2 tsp minced garlic<BR>
minced fresh dill--I guess about a tsp<BR>
(the actual recipe also calls for a tsp of olive oil but I don't use it)<BR>
<BR>
Mix it all together in advance and let the flavors get to know one another in<BR>
the fridge.<BR>
<BR>
                                    *  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *<BR>
<BR>
While I'm at it, I'll add the poached salmon.  A quick and easy favorite of<BR>
mine (my housemate thinks it's gourmet!)<BR>
<BR>
Poached Salmon<BR>
<BR>
A piece of salmon filet about 6-8 inches long, 1/2-3/4 &quot; thick<BR>
Dry white wine<BR>
Fresh Dill<BR>
Capers<BR>
(butter is optional)<BR>
<BR>
Put the salmon in a microwave dish, skin side down.  Splash a little white<BR>
wine over it so the liquid covers the bottom of the dish (if you are out of<BR>
wine, a little water and some butter works well too).  Mince some fresh dill<BR>
and sprinkle it generously over the salmon.  Sprinkle some capers* on it too.<BR>
 Cover with Saran Wrap and microwave on high for 5-6 minutes.  The thinner<BR>
parts of the salmon may making popping noises--that is the oil in the salmon<BR>
popping--take care to let it calm down a bit when you take it out of the oven<BR>
(I ended up with bits of salmon on my ceiling once).  It's better to<BR>
undercook than overcook and the cooking time is mostly a matter of the<BR>
thickness.  It's never turned out badly for me though, so I don't think it's<BR>
that sensitive to having the cooking time just right.  I hope you like it!<BR>
<BR>
*Capers are neither specifically allowed nor disallowed in Elaine's book.<BR>
 Don identified them as the berries from an evergreen shrub.  To my view,<BR>
that would make them most similar to juniper berries which are used to make<BR>
gin--which is allowed.  Capers are usually packed in brine--which is<BR>
essentially salt water.  They add a lot of flavor but are essentially a<BR>
garnish.  If you consumed a tablespoon of them that would be a lot.    If you<BR>
prefer to skip the capers, the salmon is still good.  (Personally, I eat<BR>
capers but they have always been a part of my diet and never bothered me.  If<BR>
you've never had them before, I'll certainly understand if you are leery of<BR>
trying them!)<BR>
<BR>
By the way, if you just poach the salmon with the dill, the tzatziki would<BR>
make a nice sauce/relish with it.<BR>

Hi Carolyn!  I have noticed this type of problem when I was first diagnosed<BR>
with Crohn's.  I noticed that it was in alot of spots.  When I shake<BR>
peoples hand I notice it in my wrists.  I even notice it in my elbows once<BR>
in a while.  I do get arthritis type feelings in my hands every now and<BR>
then, mostly in my thumbs.  I am glad I have a very caring wife and an<BR>
understanding wife.  She sees when it hurts me at times and rubs where it<BR>
aches.  She is terrific throughout this awful disease.  I don't know what I<BR>
would do with out her.  She is the best thing that happened to me other<BR>
than this diet. <BR>

I rely on avocados!  For me, these are super food, somehow seem really<BR>
easy to digest and have a high vegetable fat content.  I add them to<BR>
everything I eat.  Unfortunately, since we have to work so hard to get<BR>
carbs in on the SCD, I rely on fats to pack in more calories.  Also<BR>
though, make sure you are getting as much carbs as possible.  Lately<BR>
I've been eating A LOT of split peas soup.  I'm not sure where you are<BR>
at with the diet in terms of what foods you can and can't eat.  If you<BR>
can handle the cookie recipes, they are a fantastic source of carbs and<BR>
calories as well.<BR>

Good morning all,<BR>
<BR>
A couple of questions which I'd appreciate help with:<BR>
<BR>
1) How long can the homemade yoghurt stay fresh in the<BR>
   refrigerator once it's been &quot;cooked&quot;?  More than a<BR>
   couple of days?<BR>
<BR>
2) Is Friendship Farmer's cheese ok to use?  It's got<BR>
   skim milk, cream and salt.<BR>
<BR>
3) I've not yet tried to make the yogurt.  I'm extremely<BR>
   intolerant to dairy at this time.  In addition,<BR>
   I cannot tolerate pro-biotic formulas at all either.<BR>
   They make my symptoms worse.  I will try the yoghurt<BR>
   once I find a good stable 100-110 degree location to<BR>
   cook it.  Though, I worry.  What if I can't tolerate<BR>
   it, and I can't take pro-biotics?  How do I get the<BR>
   &quot;good&quot; bacteria in me?<BR>
<BR>
Kind regards,<BR>

Dear All,<BR>
<BR>
I have been subscribed to this list for about 2 weeks and I am so impressed <BR>
with the support and encouragement that you all give to each other.<BR>
<BR>
I am studying to become a Nutrition Consultant in England and would like to <BR>
pick your collective brains for information of two different sorts.<BR>
<BR>
Firstly,  is there anyone in the UK on this list?  I know of several other <BR>
practitioners in this country who are keen to try this diet with their <BR>
client's but who are struggling to find suppliers for several of the SCD <BR>
staples.  A good example of this is the farmer's cheese.  If there is anyone <BR>
out there who can help?   I would be happy to pass this information to other <BR>
nutritionists.  I would love to speak to someone in this country who has <BR>
successfully used the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly, as part of my studies I am writing a dissertation on the <BR>
Nutritional Management of Crohn's Disease.  I was interested in Ted's <BR>
message which mentioned some relevant papers.  If anyone has information on <BR>
papers that relate to diet and Crohn's I would be really grateful.<BR>
<BR>
I will be on email at work on                  hazel.pelham@bbc.co.uk <BR>
         until 16 September when I am leaving work to set up my nutrition <BR>
practise.<BR>
<BR>
Having suffered 7 years of Crohn's, I have been 99% symptom free for the <BR>
last 7 years using a variety of diets, so it really can work.<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck and Good Health to you all.<BR>

Hello brain fog friends.  It's comforting to know there are a few others<BR>
&gt;who know what I am referring to!  In the last few days I've been trying<BR>
&gt;something my husband recommended to me that seems to be helping.  I say<BR>
&gt;seems, because although it *has* been helping, it's too soon to say it's<BR>
&gt;because of what I've been doing or coincidence, but I'm ready to share.<BR>
&gt;My husband (who is in the medical field) had the idea that I could<BR>
&gt;possible have a mineral deficiency because of my absorbtion problems<BR>
&gt;(re: IBS) and because I get the brain-fog, which seems to mimic<BR>
&gt;low-blood sugar swings in spite of eating a lot of food (by the way<BR>
&gt;Prateeksha, thanks for the carbs reminder.  I try to eat lots of split<BR>
&gt;pea soup and lima beans, apples, seem to get enough carbs).  I've been<BR>
&gt;taking a mineral supplement that seems to have stabilized my energy<BR>
&gt;levels and the brain fog has been non-existent since I started to take<BR>
&gt;them (for the last four days, which is significant for me).  If you want<BR>
&gt;to try, make sure you get a calcium-magnesium supplement that is calcium<BR>
&gt;and magnesium *citrate,* not carbonate.  This is apparently very<BR>
&gt;important because the citrate comes from vegetable sources and is much<BR>
&gt;easier to absorb by the body.  I used to take Calc./Mag. supplements but<BR>
&gt;never noticed a difference until I took the citrate form.  I hope this<BR>
&gt;info. helps someone else too and I wish us all luck in figuring this<BR>
&gt;problem out.<BR>

&gt; &gt;them (for the last four days, which is significant for me).  If you want<BR>
&gt; &gt;to try, make sure you get a calcium-magnesium supplement that is calcium<BR>
&gt; &gt;and magnesium *citrate,* not carbonate.  This is apparently very<BR>
&gt; &gt;important because the citrate comes from vegetable sources and is much<BR>
&gt; &gt;easier to absorb by the body.  I used to take Calc./Mag. supplements but<BR>
&gt; &gt;never noticed a difference until I took the citrate form.  I hope this<BR>
&gt; &gt;info. helps someone else too and I wish us all luck in figuring this<BR>
&gt; &gt;problem out.<BR>

Hi ALL!<BR>
        Has anyone in Canada ordered the almond flour from Hughson Nut Co.?<BR>
What price did you pay?<BR>
        I ordered the pecan meal from Dutch Valley in Pennsylvannia last<BR>
fall and , although it still was a good price, I had to pay a hefty<BR>
brokerage fee at this end- east coast of Canada. <BR>
        The almond price is great at Hughson-- here it's close to 10.00/lb.<BR>
Melissa prefers it to the pecan- loks more 'normal'.<BR>
        The Coping With Prednisone book sounds very informative- I recently<BR>
saw the authors interviewed on TV and they seem to cover all  aspects of<BR>
side-effects.<BR>

Hi Ellen,<BR>
<BR>
&gt;          ..... I'd rather the<BR>
&gt; true causes of this disease be understood and resolved.  I'd rather live in a<BR>
&gt; world where children don't suffer with this--at all, not for a minute.  I<BR>
&gt; hope for a future where IBD, like polio, is better known as a childhood<BR>
&gt; vaccine than a disease.<BR>
<BR>
Don't we all !  If IBD is in any way genetic (and we can only speculate),<BR>
I dread the possibility of my children ever getting CD/UC.  The best I can do<BR>
is control what and how they eat, avoiding overuse of sugar especially.  Like<BR>
they say, &quot;everything is ok... in moderation of course&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Despite the fact that I didn't have a choice about joining the IBD community,<BR>
<BR>
I already shared my personal opinions on why I got IBD on an earlier posting.<BR>
Hindsight is a wonderful thing, like in the stock market.  I just heard a very<BR>
interesting quote yesterday.<BR>
    &quot;Life is a hard teacher, the test comes first, then followed by the lesson&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; now that I'm here, I feel impelled to contribute as I can to the community.<BR>
<BR>
I contribute by sharing my personal experiences.  In this forum, I can open up<BR>
whereas I normally keep my condition very private.  I rarely discuss it with<BR>
co-workers unless I think it can help someone.  I don't complain about my IBD,<BR>
I deal with it (I believe you and Rachel also commented on being stoic).<BR>
I am sure you have noticed my posts on the crohns-colitis newsgroup, and<BR>
I comment on the very negative side-effect of prednisone which has left me<BR>
with osteoporosis at 33 (again hindsight).  So if this helps people<BR>
look at things more openly, I'll share what I normally keep to myself.<BR>
<BR>
P.S. You're welcome (Hughson email address).  I checked and the cost is about<BR>
the same except that I have the Canadian exchange rate to worry about, plus<BR>
possible duty taxes. So I guess I'll try harder to find a local supplier.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Rachel,<BR>
 <BR>
I also stopped supporting CCFC (Canada) due to their strong bent towards only<BR>
a medical (ie: prescription drugs) solution.  I always prefer taking a natural<BR>
approach to things.  Diet and vitamins, done properly, do not have side-effects.<BR>
Prescription drugs always have side-effects.<BR>
 <BR>
My personal experience with doctors is that they were only taught to look at<BR>
symptoms, prescribe the drug which is supposed to alleviate them (and hope it<BR>
works).  These will usually work for some time, until the side-effects start<BR>
appearing. And then doctors say (my words) &quot;Oh! Well now we'll prescribe this<BR>
drug, and that drug, and these drugs in combination, and so on.<BR>
 <BR>
IMHO, they should have more of a preventative approach to medicine, and not a<BR>
reactive one.  However, we all know that there's no money in it for them, or<BR>
pharmaceutical companies (sorry Ellen), to follow this approach.  Is it not<BR>
cheaper in the long run to service your car on a regular basis, instead<BR>
of a big repair bill down the road ?  Why is that any different for us ?<BR>
 <BR>
It surprises me that insurance companies won't cover the cost of vitamins and<BR>
minerals (even prescribed), but they any prescription drug is ok.  My need for<BR>
extra Calcium and vitamin D are a direct result of osteo (prednisone side-effect),<BR>
yet I must still pay for them. Does that make sense ?<BR>
 <BR>
Thanks for letting me vent...<BR>
 <BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Subject: psyllium use<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;9709082205.AA83210@acs5.acs.ucalgary.ca&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi group,<BR>
 <BR>
Got a question for anyone !  JoEllen mentioned using Psyllium, even though she<BR>
had D. prior to starting the diet.  I recall (I believe) Denise saying that she<BR>
sometimes used it to help with constipation.  And doesn't Metamucil use this<BR>
ingredient (natural fibre).  I have been using it also as I was told it would<BR>
help.  Now I am wondering if perhaps it is more to help constipation and should<BR>
not be used when stools are loose.  Any comments ?<BR>
 <BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Dear Dan,<BR>
Anytime.<BR>
I do have to say that in recent years the insurance companies have been<BR>
taking baby steps in the direction of alternative meds. Chiropractors are<BR>
probably the first being allowed to submit for payment on what was once<BR>
considered purely alternative. Insurance companies have begun to realize<BR>
that paying for some adjustments beats the hell out of paying for back<BR>
surgery followed by intensive physical therapy. Who knows, maybe someday<BR>
they'll see the light, even if their motivation is having to pay less for<BR>
this type of treatment.<BR>
