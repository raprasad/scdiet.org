<B>Decafe<BR>
</B><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt;Is decafe (water extraction process) allowed?<BR>
&gt;Dave Johnson<BR>
&gt;</FONT></TT><BR>
Weak coffee and black teas are allowed if made from ground beans and not<BR>
instant coffee mixes, therefore I don't see why decaf would be any different.
<BR>
The only thing I would question are those artificially flavored coffees
like<BR>
irish cream or whatever. These also come as ground coffee beans but I think<BR>
they add artificial stuff which may have sugar - I don't know.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that coffee is a natural laxitive and will move the bowels.<BR>

<B>Re: Maltodextrin<BR>
<BR>
</B><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt;Can we have maltodextrin? I was reading the ingredients
on a Kool-Aid<BR>
&gt;package<BR>
&gt;and came across &quot;maltodextrin (from corn)&quot;. Seeing as it is
from corn is<BR>
&gt;this a<BR>
&gt;no no. If we are allowed to have it all I'll do is put in dextrose in<BR>
&gt;place for the sugar.<BR>

I personally would avoid maltodextrin. I am no authority on the matter though,<BR>
so you'd have to ask Elaine to be sure, but I would bet anything that she'll<BR>
say no. Kool Aid is bad anyway. It's better to avoid all that artificial<BR>
stuff. Get Welch's grape juice in the glass bottle (purple). I don't like
the<BR>
white because it has sodium benzoate added I think, and it tastes funny.
The<BR>
purple is good though. I make grape jello, grape popsicles, and drink it<BR>
watered down as juice. Trust me, it's way better for you than kool aid.
You<BR>
can make your own lemonade by using pure lemon juice and dextrose or honey.
I<BR>
also use minute maid &quot;low acid&quot; orange juice. I find it usually
agrees with<BR>
me. Look for the Low Acid on the label, as there is regular, extra pulp,
etc. <BR>
The good one is the Low acid one.<BR>

Dear Mik and Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
PLEASE do not drink that kombucha tea.  It is very dangerous and risky.
 There<BR>
have been cases of severe liver damage and even death from it.  It is not
safe.<BR>
 Avoid it like the plague.<BR>

I know that some batches go &quot;bad&quot; from air borne yeast or bacterial<BR>
contamination.<BR>
<BR>
My friend was a heavy mushroom tea user, then noticed her stomach protruding<BR>
until she finally looked pregnant. She had cancer. When they opened her
up,<BR>
there was cancer spread all over her abdominal cavity, attached to<BR>
everything. I know she wonders if it has something to do with the mushroom
tea.<BR>
<BR>
I know there are bottled teas, which might be safer. But if they are<BR>
pasturized for safety, the enzymes would be killed. The news recently said,<BR>
&quot;Never drink fresh juice because of the danger of E-coli contamination.&quot;<BR>
Fresh juice is generally the healthiest thing you can drink. How to know<BR>
these things??? <BR>

<BR>
I was using the tea about a 1 1/2 years ago and found it to have a great<BR>
effect on minimizing the effects of my CD at the time. When we moved to<BR>
Indiana I got out of the habit of brewing.<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the diet for about 7 months and found it to be very helpful<BR>
in controling my CD. However, I am toying with idea of starting to &quot;brew&quot;<BR>
once again.<BR>
<BR>
Remembering way back when in my K Tea research days. The sugar added to<BR>
start the tea is metabolized by the brewing action (not sure this is the<BR>
correct technical term). In fact at the time there was a great concern from<BR>
diabetics who wanted the benefits from the tea but were concerned about
the<BR>
sugar in it. I remember the net info to say that it was miniscule and should<BR>
not represent any health hazard to them? I do not know it this trace sugar<BR>
will effect the results I have experienced from the SCD. I am seriously<BR>
thinking about giving it another try.<BR>
<BR>
You mentioned honey. I remember that there always was much conversation<BR>
about the possible bacteria and  natural contaminants present in honey.
I<BR>
would check with bbs on K tea and check if this is still the conventional<BR>
wisdom?<BR>
<BR>
Brewing K tea is very similar to making Yogurt. The protocol that is<BR>
required to make the product is not very tolerant. In other words you must<BR>
follow the recipe exactly.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the info on the <A HREF="http://www.sease.com/kombucha/index.html">K tea pages</A>.<BR>

Stay healthy,<BR>

<BR>
&gt;I have been on the diet since 12/24/96 and I drink the grape juice waterd<BR>
&gt;down, but I think it gives me &quot;D&quot;.  Does anyone notice the
same problem and<BR>
&gt;if you know why this occurs?  I noticed though if I drink the apple
cider<BR>
&gt;waterd down that I do not go to the bathroom as often and not as loose.
 I<BR>
&gt;have crohn's.<BR>
<BR>
I had the same problem with grape juice. I believe that it may be related<BR>
to mould. Grapes are naturally mouldy and bottled grape juice can easily<BR>
patially ferment. So I would recommend staying off bottled juices and<BR>
getting yourself to an allergy speciallist for mould or more likely is it<BR>
to be an underlying candida infection that can create a mould allergy.<BR>
<BR>
another possibility is that of candida being fed be all the available sugar<BR>
in the juice. My method not is to avoid fruit juices and things with high<BR>
glycemic indexes. and go for the mor complex carbohydrates like the lentils<BR>
and beans and peas.<BR>

I definitely think grape juice causes problems. As I've mentioned<BR>
before, I think V8 causes problems, too. I also think all citrus fruits<BR>
and juices with the possible exception of pineapple cause problems for me.
<BR>
Speaking of fruits, I even have problems with bananas and melons. I'm<BR>
sure this isn't true for everybody, just my personal observations.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, cutting out desserts, ice cream, chocolates and most fruits<BR>
doesn't leave much - if it weren't for nuts, raisins, apples and apple<BR>
juice, my snack time would be even more boring. The truth is: food has<BR>
always played a pretty central role in my daily pleasures - I used to<BR>
&quot;reward&quot; myself if I had to work late by getting a steak or shrimp
dinner<BR>
with a big dessert and a beer. And my idea of a good Saturday morning<BR>
included three or four cups of coffee and a big plate of eggs with bacon<BR>
and potatoes at the local restaurant known for its huge portions and rich<BR>
food. But now, I'm surprised how much I *don't* miss all that stuff . <BR>
And best of all, dinner companions who don't know me very well think I'm
a<BR>
paragon of discipline and restraint ;-).<BR>
<BR>
Sorry to ramble on, but this reminds me of a friend I knew in the service<BR>
twenty years ago. We were on the way to dinner, and he said: &quot;I wish<BR>
we didn't have to eat or go to the bathroom. It just takes away time away<BR>
from the real important things in life, like playing music, hiking or<BR>
conversation.&quot; I was shocked at his statement, and, trying to convince<BR>
him of the pleasures of food, I insisted: &quot;Why, a good feast is one
of<BR>
the most enjoyable passtimes in life! And there's nothing like the<BR>
relaxation of a good trip to the bathroom.&quot; Well, I must admit that
now<BR>
I believe that food is overrated as a pleasure. And I believe I've had<BR>
enough relaxation to last a lifetime....<BR>

<B>Tomatoe juice</B> <BR>

<BR>
<TT>&gt; Also, is<BR>
&gt;the Tomatoe juice made by Campbell's an allowable tomatoe juice. </TT><BR>
<BR>
I once had a reaction to it. Being a celiac this means that it had<BR>
hydrolyzed vegetable protein from a gluten grain. I called Campbell's and<BR>
they said it did not have it. But it is made from &quot;tomato concentrate&quot;
and<BR>
they do not have to disclose the ingredients of this ingredient. So I avoid<BR>
it.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE="-1">&gt; Hi all,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Although dry wine is allowed on the SCD, I am interested to know what<BR>
&gt; others' experience with alcohol is in general. Does drinking exacerbate<BR>
&gt; your condition, contribute to inflammation, or cause your health to<BR>
&gt; deteriorate? Does the amount of alcohol consumed effect the outcome?<BR>

<BR>
I myself have been unable to tolerate any alcohol for several years. I<BR>
used to enjoy a glass of wine or a beer, but as my gut symptoms got<BR>
worse, I found that it left me feeling very tired -- right away or the<BR>
next morning, sometimes gave me a headache (both beer and wine), and in<BR>
general, increased whatever digestive symptoms I was experiencing at the<BR>
time. In general, alcohol tended to leave me feeling more stressed out<BR>
rather than more relaxed, hardly incentive to drink it! I look forward<BR>
to the day I can tolerate a glass of wine or beer again. I am assuming<BR>
that as my gut heals, someday I will.<BR>

I haven't noticed any problems with alcohol since starting this diet or
even<BR>
before. I have UC in the last 10&quot; of my colon, so I don't know if that
may<BR>
be why. Of course, I don't drink beer because it's not allowed on the diet,<BR>
but I've had drinks like vodka and tonic or orange juice without any<BR>
problems.<BR>

&gt; no-sugar-added wine is the most preferred for religious use<BR>
&gt; (Sabbath/holiday kiddush and the four cups at the Passover seder).  We<BR>
&gt; regularly buy this naturally-sweet wine by the case.  Is there any<BR>
&gt; reason why it can't be used for SCD?<BR>
&gt; <BR></FONT></B>
<BR>
Deanna,<BR>
<BR>
We discussed wine some time back. The principles of wine production are:<BR>
<BR>
Grapes have natural sugar in them, apparently in a form that is SCD OK.<BR>
<BR>
To make wine, the grapes are fermented to turn sugar to alchohol. The<BR>
ratio is 2 to 1. That is, grapes with 20% sugar fermented until all of<BR>
the sugar has been consumed by the yeast, will yield wine with 10%<BR>
alchohol.<BR>
<BR>
Normally, fermentation goes until the sugar is all consumed giving a<BR>
wine with no sugar (aka dry wine). <BR>
<BR>
To get a sweet wine, you need to stop the fermentation before all of the<BR>
sugar has been consumed, or you need to add sugar after the fermentation<BR>
is done. <BR>
<BR>
If the grapes were picked with a lower than desired sugar value, sugar<BR>
can be added to bring the percent sugar up to the desired level. As this<BR>
is an added expense, it is only done if necessary. In climates that have<BR>
little or no trouble ripening grapes, it is rare to add sugar. Elaine<BR>
talked about huge piles of sugar at a winery waiting to be added to the<BR>
wine. This probably reflects her experience in Ontario. In California<BR>
and here in Oregon, it is very rare.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine's prohibition on non-dry wine is because of the possibility that<BR>
sugar (sucrose) was added and thus that the residual sweetness will<BR>
contain some sucrose. If you know that no sucrose was added, either<BR>
because of kosher rules, or because you asked the winery, then a sweet<BR>
wine shouldn't be a problem. If the wine is from a region where adding<BR>
sugar isn't likely, then you probably are OK. <BR>
<BR>
Looking at the alchohol content of the wine tells you nothing about the<BR>
amount or kind of residual sugar. An alcohol content of 12% means that<BR>
at least 24% sugar was available for the yeast. That 24% could have come<BR>
from the grapes alone, or from grapes plus added sugar. Any original<BR>
sugar content above 24% will be present in the finished wine as residual<BR>
sugar.<BR>
<BR>
Due to federal regulations, wineries must keep detailed records of<BR>
everything that goes into the wine. The wineries could tell you for sure<BR>
whether sugar was added. Smaller wineries are probably more interested<BR>
in talking about such details than huge outfits like Gallo. <BR>
<BR>
This may be more than you wanted to know. I grow wine grapes and as it<BR>
happens, this is harvest season. 3 acres picked and 5 more to go.<BR>
