 <B>Abstract</B><BR>
 Correspondence of fat intake with civilisatory diseases
 (coronary disease and cancer) is usually attributed to adverse effects
of
 animal fat and cholesterol. The 'field studies' themselves undertaken
to
 support this theory, failed. As the last environmental changes in human
 history are agriculture and rise of carbohydrate intake (and concomitant
 reduction of fat and protein consumption), the author thinks that the
 carbohydrates rather than the animal fats cause our civilisatory diseases.
  <P>
 It can be shown that the spread of agriculture from the Near East to
the
 West and North of Europe with the accompanying differences in time for
the
 adaptation to the new food (the carbohydrates) easily explains the
 geographic differences in the frequency of civilisatory diseases which
is
 highest where (in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Finland) carbohydrates
came
 last. Highest, too, in those areas is the 'polymorphism' of genes which
are
 related to cardiovascular diseases (ACE, apolipoprotein-B etc.) This
 'adaptation theory' explains also the hitherto unexplained up and down
of
 cardiovascular disease in the USA by immigration from regions with higher
 adaptation to carbohydrates.

  <P>
 Generally it is thought that animal fats and cholesterol are the causes
of
 our civilisatory diseases. I am offering an alternative to this 'lipid
 theory' suggesting that the paleolithic hunter, adapted through millions
of
 years to a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, high-protein diet, has not yet
had
 the evolutionary time to adapt to the high-carbohydrate diet of the
 Neolithic farmer, and that this, not fat, largely explains the 'diseases
of
 civilisation'. In our evolution, we had millions of years of scavenging
with
 a high intake of animal fat (bone marrow and brain); the mammoths of
the
 last ice age delivered animal fat in considerable amounts.
  <P>
 One of the first authors to suggest this was Vilhjalmur Stefansson,
an
 Icelandic-born American who had lived for many years with the McKenzie
river
 Eskimos of Northern Canada. Stefansson saw that as long as these people
 lived only on animal protein and fat they remained free from Western
 diseases. He observed that they began to suffer from our diseases with
the
 introduction of our food high in carbohydrates (1).
  <P>
 Inspired by his work, I collected experimental and clinical evidence
that
 supported his views. In an experiment with chickens - who in their natural
 environment eat little grain - I and my collegues showed that chickens
fed a
 high-fat, high-protein diet developed much less arteriosclerosis than
 chickens fed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (2). In over thirty years
of
 clinical practice, I have found, as published in numerous papers and
several
 books (3, 4), that the diet works very well against Crohn's disease,
 ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, heart failure, acne and other
 problems. Surprising to many, this diet lowers blood cholesterol and
 triglyceride levels as well. As for Crohn's disease, a prospective
 randomized multicenter study (5) has shown a significant drop in relapse
 rates in hospitalized patients after discontinuation of cortisone.
  <P>
 But Ancel Keys' 'seven countries' study (6) found that a low ingestion
of
 fat was associated with a low incidence of coronary disease against
people
 who ingested more fat (Fig. 1). Other investigations revealed a similar
 pattern with cancer ((7), Fig. 2). How then can one square these data
with
 the belief that excess carbohydrate is the villain of the dietary piece?
  <P>
 On closer inspection of the diagrams in Figures 1 and 2, you can see
that
 populations to the left not only eat less fat but live more to the East
and
 South of Europe and those on the right not only eat more fat but are
located
 more to the North and West, at least regarding their origin in Europe
(4).
 This corresponds with the spread of farming from the Near East to West
and
 North of Europe.
  <P>
 Agriculture originated in different places at different times. It was
firmly
 established in Central Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Syria about 10,000
years
 B.C. At the time, significantly  the Scandinavians and the British Isles
 raised no grain at all. The success in farming led to an increase in
 population pressure and, therefore, to migratory expansion. The path
of
 farmers, elucidated by archeologists (8), Linguists ((9, 10), Fig. 3)
and
 population geneticists ((11, 12), Fig. 4) appears to have been from
the
 Eastern to the Western Mediterranean, towards South East (Pakistan,
India
 and Arabia) and to North Africa. From the Black and Caspian Sea. the
farmers
 wandered in an 'advancing wave' to the West and North of Europe. In
the
 course of 4-5 millenia. they mixed with and displaced the indigenous
 Europeans (descendents of the Cro Magnon people) which lived as Paleolithics
 and therefore lacked adaptation to carbohydrates. As for Europe, Neolithic
 settlements with residues of farming existed in Greece, Italy. Southern
and
 central France and the Iberic peninsula around 6500 years B.C., in Germany
 at 5500. and around the Baltic at 3500 B.C. (8). 
  <P>
 Thus, as agriculture spread to the West and North of Europe, the people
of
 the East and South had more evolutionary time, in Darwinian terms to
adapt
 to the new food. Those who did not have the genes to tolerate larger
amounts
 of carbohydrates from the newly invented farming suffered from
 carbohydrate-induced diseases such as obesity, diabetes. infertility,
 Lactating difficulties, high infant mortality. muscular weakness and
so on.
 In the course of millenia genes not suited to cope with carbohydrates
would
 diminish in their genome. It is of great interest that eat early farmers
in
 Greece and Turkey were five inches shorter than their athletic paleolithic
 ancestors (13).
  <P>
 There are two factors which must have modified the South East-North
West
 trend of adaptation.
  <P>
 1. The three invasions of the Kurgans (8) from the Wolga district to
Central
 Europe (Fig. 4B). Though they had some agriculture, they were herdsman
and
 lived predominantly on meat. They, therefore, brought back some genomes
less
 well adapted to carbohydrates to Central Europe (together with the tamed
 horse, the wheel and advanced weapons).
  <P>
 2. The Roman empire played a major role in spreading agriculture around
so
 that those within the empire developed more tolerance. By contrast,
in
 countries outside the empire, i.e. Northern Ireland, Scotland and the
 Scandinavian countries (especially Karelia), the rates of myocardial
 infarctions are the highest ((14), Fig. 5).
   <P>
 3. The sheer existence of Neolithic settlements does not represent exactly
 the food eaten by those peoples. The further-North-living populations
 probably ate fewer carbohydrates and derived more calories from animal
 sources because agriculture was more difficult and less abundant. Therefore,
 the difference in adaptation to carbohydrates must be more intense today
 than expressed solely by the geographic gradient. In my view, the influences
 of these three factors on the original adaptive trend from SE to NW
produce
 the spotted picture of proneness to our civilisatory diseases in Europe
and
 from there to all 'Western' people in the world. 
  <P>
 If one replaces the original scale of fat ingestion in Figures I and
2 with
 the number of millenia a people had to adapt to farming (so that they
now
 have a high intake of carbohydrates and a low intake of fat), the results
of
 Keys (6) can easily be explained by the decree the of adaptation to
 carbohydrates, even better than by the intake of fat. You will note
that the
 points for France and Finland which did not correspond previously, in
spite
 of the same amount and quality of fat ingested ('French Paradox' (15)).
now
 fall in place.
  <P>
 Where are, then, the genes that enable a person to tolerate carbohydrates
 and not to succumb to coronary disease and cancer? In 1992, Francois
 Cambien, a French researcher. and his group found an incomplete gene
for the
 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in patients with myocardial infarctions
 otherwise thought at low risk (16), ACE profoundly influences circulation
 because it promotes the output of angiotensin II and the breakdown of
 bradykinin, factors that enhance the production of smooth muscle cells
in
 arteries and may promote coronary sclerosis and thrombosis as well as
heart
 failure. This 'deletion polymorphism', i.e. the incompleteness of this
gene,
 occurs predominantly in areas such as Northern Ireland (Belfast) for
 instance, where carbohydrates arrived later. The gene for apolipoprotein
B.
 which regulates the docking of LDL at the cell membrane and therefore
its
 entrance into the cell, shows the same polymorphism (17). In its incomplete
 form, it is more frequent in Northern Ireland than in Strasbourg and
 Toulouse. One may speculate that the incomplete genes, were the genes
of the
 Paleolithic hunter and gatherer which are on the way to be completed
in a
 carbohydrate-eating population. Probably there are other incomplete
(for
 cancer, hyperinsulinism. adiposity, diabetes etc). As for cancer, there
are
 plenty of possibilities to think of incomplete oncogenes left over from
the
 time of primordial agriculture. Not all of them must have been deleted
by
 viruses.
  <P>
 But how can one reconcile the recent drop in heart disease in the United
 States with this 'adaptation theory' (4)? This drop does not stem from
a
 reduction of amount of fat ingested: very likely it results, in part
at
 least. from immigration of people from the Mediterranean or other areas
who
 had already acquired a higher tolerance to carbohydrates. Thus, when
these
 people reached the coronary age, the incidence fell.
  <P>
 What has been said about Europe and the Western world seems to hold
for the
 Far East as well. The cultivation of rice is older than that of grain,
and
 therefore the adaptation to carbohydrates is even better. But since
it is by
 far not complete, even the Japanese show a significant rise in longevity
 under American dietary influence, that is the ingestion of more animal
 protein and fat (18).
 <P>
 Clearly there are still many open questions in our view of a healthy
human
 nutrition, open to studies by a multitude of researchers, but I think
it is
 time to consider the transition from the Paleolithic, i.e. our high
intake
 of carbohydrates, as one of the causes of our diseases.

 Fig. 1  The rate of myocardial infarctions in European populations (and
some
 of European ancestry) coincides with the East-West. North-South gradient,
 i.e. with the distance from the Paleolithic (lower scale) better than
with
 the fat content of the food (upper scale).
  <P>
 In France. about the same amount of fat is eaten as in Finland. but
the rate
 of heart strokes is about one fifth ('French Paradox'). By the lower
scale,
 the point for Finland moves to the right and the one for France to the
left
 (arrows); the plot straightens. French population stems predominantly
from
 the Mediterranean, where adaptation to carbohydrates had more time to
 develop. (See also Fig. 5). (Adapted from (15) with the kind permission

  <P>
 Fig. 2  Breast cancer mortality in Europe 1980 through 1984. Upper scale
 saturated fat intake (g/day): lower scale: distance in tame from Paleolithic
 (time for adaption to carbohydrates). Higher intake of fat today means
fewer
 carbohydrates for a longer time (and of less intensity); it means,
 therefore, less adaptation to carbohydrates. (Combined from WHO Regional
 Publication Series #24, 1988, 85, and OM).

 Fig. 3  Zone of origination had three 'lobes', each of which may have
given
 rise to a great family of languages by diffusion. The Anatolian lobe,
 containing Catal Hoyuk, may have been the cradle of the Indo-European
 languages. A second lobe, containing Jericho, may have been the homeland
of
 the languages of Egypt and northern Africa. A third lobe, containing
Ali
 Kosh, may been the source of a group of languages in India and Pakistan
that
 were later replaced by languages of the Indo-European group. Elsloo,
Jeitun
 and Mehrgarh are early farming sites in these great diffusional pathways.
 the processes that are depicted on the map are theoretical but are supported
 by recent findings in linguistics and genetics. The spread of agriculture
 from the Near East: a) from Iran and Iraq (Ali Kosh) to Pakistan and
India;
 b) from Jericho towards Arabia and North Africa; c) from Central Anatolia
 (Catal Huyuk) to Europe, taking there agriculture and the Indo-European
 languages. The more to the West and North a population is situated today,
 the later came the Neolithic and the agriculture, and the lower the
adaption
 to carbohydrates. (Reproduced by the kind permission of the author (9)

 diameter of the circular areas correspond to 100 deaths from myocardial
 infarctions per 100,000 male inhabitants in the age group 45-65 in 1984.
 Aside from Novi Sad, which is made questionable by the low number of
 participants and the widely differing result of nearby Belgrade, the
 mortality comes in three grades: a) lowest mortality in the Mediterranean
 where agriculture invested in the Near East about 10,000 years ago came
 first, strongly distributed in the Roman empire. b) highest in Northern
 Ireland, Scotland and Finland (also in Siberia), where carbohydrates
came
 last and were not spread by the Romans. c) a median tendency to heart
 attacks where the 'advancing wave' of farming from South East to North
West
 came between 5000 and 6000 years ago, and where adaptation to carbohydrates
 was weakened by the Kurgans (herdsmen rather than farmers), and the
Roman
 influence was absent North of Roman lines.
