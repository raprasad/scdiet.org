<B>Questions for Elaine</B><BR>
Thu,  2 Jan 1997 17:08:17 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I was diagnosed with uc about 2 months ago and the colonoscopy showed all<BR>
but the descending colon was involved.  High doses of asacol (4<BR>
pill/3x/day) are currently having little effect.  I am trying to round up
a<BR>
yogurt maker/warming tray and the rest of the supplies including the<BR>
elusive dry curd cottage cheese so I can try the diet. My concern about
the<BR>
diet is simple.<BR>
<BR>
I believe in the results that I have seen on the net, but the science<BR>
teacher in me wonders if these people might have been heading for one of<BR>
their periodic remissions and the diet had little or nothing to do with<BR>
that anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine in her new book (pg. 26) talks about the damage to the microvilli,<BR>
leading to their destruction and loss of their digestive/absorptive fate
in<BR>
carbohydrate metabolism. In turn the mucus producing goblet cells increase<BR>
in number and activity resulting in a hyper-production of mucus.  She<BR>
states that this leads to a &quot;naked intestine&quot; and ulceration as
seen in<BR>
ulcerative colitis.  The problem is microvilli only are found in the small<BR>
intestine and as the name &quot;colitis&quot; implies my problem is downstream
in the<BR>
large intestine/colon.<BR>
<BR>
Again microvilli and carbohydrases (enzymes that digest carbohydrates) are<BR>
only a part of the small intestine, they do not exist in the colon, never<BR>
have and never will.  So, is ulcerative colitis really a prolbem with the<BR>
small intestine leading to ulceration in the colon?  None of the literature<BR>
suggests that we uc patients have anything wrong in the small intestine.<BR>
Help!<BR>
<BR>
Also if the central idea behind the diet is to starve out the bad bacteria,<BR>
what about the normal and necessary &quot;good&quot; bacteria that make
up part of<BR>
the healthy and required bacterial zoo that our intestines normally<BR>
maintain?  Is the diet somehow that selective and only starves the bad<BR>
boys?<BR>
<BR>
Again the testimonials are powerful stuff, BUT can anyone help me deal with<BR>
these areas of confusion?<BR>

<B>Dear Dave,</B><BR>
If you can somehow squelch the scientist in you and use just a little blind<BR>
faith in your approach to the diet, it may be the best route to take.<BR>
Frankly, I didn't even understand half of the scientific gobbledegook when<BR>
I read the book. In fact my basis for NOT wanting to try the diet was the<BR>
notion that fruits and vegteables would kill me or at least re-hospitalize<BR>
me. Oddly enough, when I finished reading the book and telling my husband<BR>
what a maniac this person who wrote it must be, I got a phone call from
my<BR>
cousin. I told her about what I'd just read and she remembered about a<BR>
friend of hers with Crohns who had just gone on a similar diet with major<BR>
success. I called the woman and listened to what amounted to a miracle.<BR>
THATS what made me try it and I promise you that what I experienced was<BR>
nothing short of a miracle. It'll be 2 years on May 1st since I went on
the<BR>
diet. I no longer have diahrea, profuce bleeding, mucous, urgency or any
of<BR>
the other lovely symptoms associated with by Ulcerative Colitis. Last year,<BR>
when I went for my yearly colonoscopy (my next one is 1/31), my doctor told<BR>
me in amazement that my colon looked like that of a healthy 18 year olds<BR>
(I'll be 50 next week). He also said that I seemed to be in some kind of<BR>
remission, totally refusing to give any credence to the diet he knew I was<BR>
on. I've taken myself off any and all medications for the last 6 months
and<BR>
I FEEL WONDERFUL!!<BR>
Whatever you decide I wish you the best. Keep me posted. Elaine's fax #

<BR>
Dave, <BR>
<BR>
Maybe so. The law of probablity and the bell shaped curve may be kicking
in.<BR>
Perhaps it is the plaecebo effect. Or it might be that the diet doesn't
work<BR>
for everyone (just as one medication doen't work for all of us).<BR>
<BR>
From a personal standpoint I have been on the diet almost 7 months and find<BR>
the results very encouraging. I am convinced it is the right thing for me.<BR>
However, it still could be only the plaecebo effict that I am noticing.
In<BR>
all honesty I do not care whatever it is that is making me feel better!!!<BR>
<BR>
I try to follow the diet very closely and it seems to work.  To me it is
the<BR>
Specific Carbohydrate Diet and NOT the Selective Carbohydrate Diet.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine, has the magic formula as far as my CD is concerned. I doubted, I<BR>
tried, and I now feel better. For this I feel very indebted to Elaine and<BR>
her research.<BR>

<B>Dave,</B><BR>
<BR>
&gt;I believe in the results that I have seen on the net, but the science<BR>
&gt;teacher in me wonders if these people might have been heading for one
of<BR>
&gt;their periodic remissions and the diet had little or nothing to do with<BR>
&gt;that anyway.<BR>
<BR>
I started the diet about a month ago, when my crohns simptoms where at their<BR>
*worst*.  Two days after stating the diet, I had no cramps and the diarrhea
was<BR>
disapearing.  A week after, I had no cramps, no pain, no diarrhea, and I
was<BR>
feeling hungry for the first time after more than a year and a half!  I'm<BR>
currently feeling great, and have even started gaining some much needed<BR>
weight (slowly, but its happening... :)<BR>
<BR>
I can't answer your questions as to what is happening inside the intestine<BR>
with the microvilli, et all, but I can assure you that I was not going into<BR>
remission when I started the diet.  On the contrary, I was feeling as bad
as<BR>
I did three years ago when I ended up having to undergo a re-section.  The<BR>
funny thing is that I was very skeptical about the diet, and reluctant to<BR>
get started on it. :)<BR>

Dear Dave,<BR><BR>

I found your questions concerning the diet interesting.  I have some
suggestions although they may not necessarily be correct.<BR><BR>

From my understanding the pathogenic bacteria may proliferate in different
areas of the intestine and not be through out the intestine.  Hence you may
get extensive small intestine damage but if the bacteria become lodged in
the large intestine then this is where they do their damage.  They feed on
the remains of undigested foods producing toxins to the system that may
cause ulceration.   These kind of bacteria are particularly good at clinging
to the intestine walls so that peristalsis doesn't wash them out but the
downward action of the movement especially in diarrhea makes it difficult
for them to spread up the intestine from the large intestine to the small
intestine.<BR><BR>


<TT>
>Also if the central idea behind the diet is to starve out the bad bacteria,<BR>
>what about the normal and necessary "good" bacteria that make up part of<BR>
>the healthy and required bacterial zoo that our intestines normally<BR>
>maintain?  Is the diet somehow that selective and only starves the bad<BR>
>boys?<BR></TT>

My understanding here is that the normal bacterial flora feeds on foods that
we don't normally digest such as cellulose.    The pathogenic bacteria feed
more on undigested starches and disaccharides which we may all have to some
degree.  This is further exacerbated when the small intestine isn't
digesting or absorbing completely.  <BR>
I know these thoughts don't completely answer all your questions but I do
find much of Elaine's theory biologically sound.<BR><BR>

Good health<BR>

Hi to Dave and Amanda and all:<BR><BR>

I'm still a bit of a lurker here, just starting the diet, and too new at it
to have a lot to say.<BR>
But one thing I thought in response to Dave's questions hasn't been
mentioned, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents.<BR><BR>

Dave asked why the diet isn't harmful to the Good Guy bacteria as well as the
Bad Guys.  Amanda's answer about the non-pathogenic bacteria feeding off what
we *normally* don't digest is accurate, but I think another large portion of
the answer, possibly to be found in Elaine's diet, is the repopulation of the
gut with the acidophilus found in the yoghurt.  As I have milk allergies, I
can't eat yoghurt, so I am taking acidophilous supplements with each meal.
 Interestingly, there are people on the Crohns-Colitis newsgroup who claim
remission from symptoms just by taking acidophilous.  With all the recent
research finding bacterial links to IBD, I think it may happen eventually
that Elaine's diet is proven to have a lot of validity, and I think the
repopulation of the gut is a very important factor here.<BR><BR>

As for the fillers in meds, cellulose and starches are so cheap for
manufacturers to use as fillers, I doubt you'd ever find many without them.
 I'm on pentasa, and even with the large number of caps I must take a day, I
figure the amt of starch in there is miniscule compared to what I normally
would have taken in if not on this diet!<BR><BR>

Hope we all have a healthy '97!<BR>

<B>Giving the Diet a try</B><BR>
 Thu, 20 Feb 1997 18:23:08 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hello everybody!  I'm trying to figure out the net and learn about Crohn's<BR>
disease (which my son has been diagnosed with) at the same time and it's<BR>
overloaded my synapses, so forgive me if what I've been doing is lurking.<BR>
Since I have several loose-leaf notebooks full of information, I guess<BR>
that's what I've been doing.  It looks like I've subscribed to this list,<BR>
since I'm hearing from you guys, but I must've done it<BR>
out-of-consciousness.  I thought I'd just signed up on the IBD list digest.<BR>
My son is undergoing the second round of invasive tests--he's an adult<BR>
living in Sweden with his wife and son.  I've sent him Elaine's book and
he<BR>
isn't convinced yet.  If anybody started out very skeptical about the<BR>
scientific basis for the diet and did a turnaround I'd be glad to hear what<BR>
convinced you to give it a try. KD in Texas<BR>

<B>Re: Giving the Diet a try</B><BR>
 Fri, 21 Feb 1997 16:13:09 GMT<BR>
<BR>
KD in Texas - I was (am) very skeptical about the diet.  There are so many<BR>
bogus cures/diets out there, I figured this was just another one.  But<BR>
after living with crohn's for 15 years and going through my 2nd surgery
and<BR>
my 4th doctor I thought I would give it a try.  After all, there was<BR>
nothing on the diet that would cause my any harm, right?<BR>
<BR>
So I tried the diet, gave it a half-hearted attempt, and convinced myself<BR>
that it would not work for me.  I talked with others who were having<BR>
success with the diet.  We had a small e-mail support group back then. (not<BR>
this list)  My crohn's got worse and I was feeling very discouraged.  I<BR>
decided to try the SC diet again, and joined this group for support.  I<BR>
figured out what I did wrong last time so I could avoid the same mistakes.
<BR>
I've been on the diet for about 6 months now, and I am seeing some<BR>
improvement.<BR>
<BR>
I guess its hard to get behind a cure/diet until it works for you.  But
all<BR>
I can tell your son is, the doctors will treat you with drugs until it gets<BR>
so bad that they have to operate.  And when they cut something out, you
can<BR>
never get it back.  So try anything you can to avoid surgery, especially
a<BR>
simple diet that will do no harm at all.  But if you try this diet, give
it<BR>
a fair chance of working by following it very carefully.  This is a type
of<BR>
diet where you cannot cheat at all.  If you cheat, it throws you back to<BR>
the beginning.  So give it 4-6 months, and see if it helps.<BR>

<B>KD:</B><BR>
I was extremely skeptical when I first read Elaine's book.  I thought it
was 
a total crock and then I saw her on a talk show and she seemed like a very 
guenine person who just wanted to help.  Then I gave the diet a try, but
I 
went on the introductory diet that she recommends in her book.  It left
me 
so tired and hungry that I didn't last.  I then left a message on the 
internet about the diet and got so many positive responses about it, that
I 
decided to give it a try again, but this time not use the introductory diet, 
although I did avoid high fibre foods.<BR>
I guess the thing that made me give the diet a chance was the assurance
from 
people who had tried it, as well as from Elaine in the book the if the diet 
is going to help you it will do so within a month.  I figured that I could 
live with the diet for a month just to find out if it would help me.  And 
when I started seeing results within 2 weeks, I was convinced to stick it 
out.  Nothing gives you more incentive than becoming well.<BR>

Hope everyone is doing well,<BR>

<B>SCD oversight ?</B><BR>
 Sat, 22 Feb 1997  4:13:51 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hello Everybody.<BR>
<BR>
  I'm wondering about the yogurt/dairy/honey, etc. reactions, in light of 
my own recent discovery of my (albeit unbelievable, yet true) diet 
oversights.  This is a bit embarassing to admit.<BR>
<BR>
  I've had great success with the scd for IBS, with regard to experiencing 
a reduction in rumblings from 24hours down to a few times a day.  Alas, 
still no success in controlling the D, after 8 months on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
  I was desparate enough to begin eliminating; first, honey, then most 
fruits, then yogurt and other dairy, then out of more desparation 
vegetables, and after reading some of the scd letters, I even gave up 
grape-juice jello.  There was little left and I started losing a lot of 
weight.<BR>
<BR>
  I had extreme ups and downs in the last month, feeling like a yo-yo, 
having energy one day, and exhausted the next, when I began to re-read 
Elaine's chapter on the beginning diet while still having D. - and realize 
to my utter amazement, that, despite my good intentions, I hadn't been 
following it exactly - from the beginning.  What an oversight!  Rachel, this 
might have been my problem that eventually developed with a reaction to 
yogurt.  Roberta, I, too, began to suspect yogurt, feeling sick and 
realizing it was related to increased D.  But I think/hope this was due
to 
not following the diet to the &quot;t&quot; in the first place. (I was also
eating 
modified nut-breads).  After 4 days - strictly - on the diet, I am about 
ready to try yogurt again.  The rest can wait, for my system to be ready.<BR>
Did you all wait until the D. was completely gone before going on to the 
more general scd?<BR>
<BR>
  I missed the part in the &quot;Introduction to the Diet&quot; where, while
you<BR>
still have D. you...<BR>
<BR>
1. Omit eggs (info in her book which conflicts with the example for a 
typical day at the beginning)<BR>
2. Omit fruit (and when introduced must be cooked &amp; peeled, which I
wasn't<BR>
doing).  I also omitted the grape-juice jello, even though it is listed
on 
the sample diet; i.e., in the chicken soup routine).<BR>
3. Omit vegetables<BR>
4. Omit honey<BR>
5. Omit salads (I had been carefully making my own dressing, not realizing 
I wasn't even supposed to have salad!)<BR>
<BR>
This little list was drawn out of text from four pages in Elaine's book.
 I 
think part of my oversight was due to the way the information was 
organized, i.e., spread out, and embedded in text.  Another reason, was 
that my attention was naturally drawn to the emphasis on complete 
nutrition, due to my years of nutritional training and practice, which, 
along with Elaine's encouragement to make every effort to &quot;round-out&quot;
the 
diet by eating sensibly, apparently loomed larger in the text, for me, than 
did the instructions to omit the above listed food in various places in
the 
text.<BR>
<BR>
  Would someone mention this to Elaine, please?  I really think others 
might benefit from a re-arrangement, and focus on the initial constraints 
on the diet, too.  Thoughts?<BR>
<BR>
I hope this helps.<BR>
<BR>
To Your Good health.  To careful reading.  Carolyn<BR>

<BR>
<TT><FONT SIZE="-1">The book review below was passed on to me by my wife.<BR>
<BR>
It always amuses me to see how something that hasn't been confirmed by 
scientific method is dismissed out of hand as untrue.   That is flawed 
logic.  Annecdotal evidence is the start of all scientific research -- 
it is what leads to the hunch and the hypothesis.<BR>
<BR>
Likewise the claim that the book it is based on outdated research is a 
meaningless claim.  All research is made by standing on the shoulders of 
giants who went before us.  It would be a different story if the 
reviewer were citing new studies that contradict Elaine's hypothesis.  <BR>
But that wasn't done.<BR>

		<H2>Book Review</H2>   <BR>
<BR>
<B>From Celiac News, the newsletter publication of the Canadian Celiac<BR>
Association...Summer Edition J 1996, Volume 10, Issue Number 2, page 12.</B><BR>
<BR>
Mavis Molloy, RDN of the Canadian Celiac Association (CGA) Professional 
Advisory Board presents a series of standards for reviewing a 
publication in the Book Review column of the Summer Edition of their 
association newsletter, Celiac News. <BR>
Excerpts from her excellent review 
are shared for use and consideration when examining a new publication 
whether that is a reference volume, cookbook or journal article.<BR>
The Book Review centers on the publication, <B>Breaking the Vicious Cycle</B> 
by Elaine Gottschall. This book along with several others currently 
being promoted in the market should never be recommended for persons 
with Celiac Disease.<BR>
Following are quotes and excerpts from Mavis Molloy's review:<BR><BR>

&quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle is not recommended as a credible source for 
the dietary treatment of Celiac Disease. The material is virtually the 
same as Gottschall's first book 'Food and Gut Reaction' except for the 
addition of a foreword written by a Dr. Ronaid L. Hoffman, a new chapter 
called the Brain Connection and several new recipes. Her first book 
cannot be recommended nor can we recommend this one.'<BR>
&quot;Gottschall hypothesizes that disaccharide/polysaccharide intolerance 
teads to a decrease in absorption of these sugars causing bacterial 
overgrowth and an increase in bacterial by-products and mucous 
production, thereby injuring the small intestinal surface leading to 
further carbohydrate Intolerance and malabsorption, etc. Hence' the 
'vicious cycle.' She theorizes simplistically, that it is this cycle 
which leads to many intestinal problems such as, Celiac Disease, Crohn's 
Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Diverticulitis, Cystic Fibrosis' and 
Chronic Diarrhea. This theory is not scientifically tested and is only 
supported anecdotally.&quot;<BR>
'The Specific Carbohydrate Diet' (SCD) is proposed to work by using 
predominantly 'predigested' carbohydrates which are completely absorbed 
by the intestine thereby depriving the bacteria in the intestine of food 
and breaking the 'cycle.' &quot;<BR>
&quot;The SCD 'eliminates' all grains, starches and disaccharides. This 
translates into no wheat, rye, oats, barley, triticale, corn, rice, 
millet, buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa, cottonseed, cereal bran, fluid 
milk, commercial milk products, processed and canned meats, canned 
vegetables, and apple juice except pure apple cider.&quot;' 
The following listing represents summaries and excerpts from Ms. 
Molloy's eight concerns regarding this book:<BR>
<BR>
1. The SCD is not nutritionally balanced, making it difficult to meet 
all nutritional requirements.<BR>
<BR>
2. The author used outdated scientific data to substantiate her claims.<BR>
<BR>
3. The author leads you to believe that the SCD is virtually 
disaccharide-free; however, the fruits and vegetables allowed contain 
significant amounts of disaccharide.<BR>
<BR>
4. The author quotes medical and research data but selects only facts 
which might lend credibility to her theory.<BR>
<BR>
5. The author claims that her diet works for individuals with Celiac 
Disease who are not responsive to the gluten free diet. She outlines the 
criteria for diagnosis of Celiac Disease as established by the European 
Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology (ESPGAN). She then goes on to 
claim that many celiac patients who do not fulfill the ESPGAN criteria 
may benefit from her SCD. This is a fallacy and illogical because those 
patients who do not fulfill the ESPGAN criteria do not have Celiac 
Disease and would not be expected to respond to the gluten-free 
treatment.<BR>
<BR>
6. The author claims that other intestinal conditions give rise to the 
same villous atrophy as found in Celiac Disease. This is simply not 
true. Changes and observations seen in other conditions would not be 
confused with Celiac Disease by any competent diagnostician.<BR>
<BR>
7. Much of the information presented in the new chapter on 'The Brain 
Connection' is anecdotal. There is simply no substantiated evidence 
supporting the effectiveness of the gluten-free diet in the treatment of 
schizophrenia (or other variances and classifications of mental 
illness).<BR>
<BR>
8. The SGD is based on an outdated version of the gluten-free diet. 1951 
information needs to be validated and brought up-to-date.<BR>
Any book which makes sweeping claims to cure a disease must be viewed 
with caution. Books such as this one written to appeal on more of an 
emotional level rather than an objective' scientific level typically 
represent theories and ideas which need to be questioned. There was a 
time when books with an introduction and review by a medical 
professional could be looked on with a higher level of acceptance and a 
rationale for generai direction and use, this is not the case with 
Breaking the Vicious Cycle.<BR>
When dealing with a condition such as Celiac Dlsease for which the real 
cause and the real cure may not yet be known; where we are dealing with 
well-researched theory and practice, but may not yet have all the 
answers -- there is much room for the next author' the next professional, 
the next jackass willing to bray&quot; (credited to Will Rogers) -- to do a 
&quot;sales job&quot; with &quot;their selection of data&quot; and their
&quot;approach and 
rationale&quot; for you the reader or listener, for you the celiac who is 
actually out looking for good direction and some solid information. But 
it may not be there; it may not be available-just yet.<BR>
For a diet such as the gluten-free diet for which perhaps only two to 
three percent of the information is presently known and available to us, 
considerable more research and practice remains to be done. Yes, the 
other 97 percent is out there someplace, but it may not be in that new 
coskbook or slick paperback you pulsed off the shelf just last week. The 
message continues to be -- let the buyer beware! Caveat Emptor! One buys 
at his own risk. And without a solid, cautious and scrupulous evaluation 
for many of the publications and cookbooks rushing into the market, one 
buys and &quot;buys into some new idea or practice&quot; or &quot;is taken
in&quot; at an 
even greater risk.<BR>

<BR>
It angers and upsets me when I come across these types of reviews.  My reply
to 
that woman would be: &quot;then why did it work for me when nothing else
would&quot;.  I 
am sick of convincing people who just want to be against something instead
of 
giving it a chance.  Why doesn't this woman want to let celiac or other 
patients try this diet?  It is clearly not dangerous, so people should be
free 
to try it as they please, without interferance and unfounded reports like
hers.<BR>
 Her whole report is just as anecdotal and unscientific as what she is arguing 
against.  I guess I must learn to ignore these nay-sayers, though it is
very 
difficult!.<BR>

<B>The book review</B><BR>

Wed, 16 Apr 1997  2:20:56 GMT<BR>
<BR>

In regards to the book review making the list and making some people angry. I am on the diet and it is not a clear cut answer for me, Asacol is clear cut.  I cut down a pill from a rather high dose of 12/day and I have a flare for days/weeks. I have been faithfully on the diet for 4 months and have not had more than 2 weeks of relief from the symptoms.  <BR>I am sticking with the diet, I figure it can't hurt.  <BR>Let's be honest the SCD is anecdotal and not tested. We really don't hear from individuals where there has been no change or worsening, perhaps there are none, perhaps they are guilty over their lack of success.   <BR>Those of you that it is helping have
a good likelihood of suffering from &quot;sprue&quot; or another food intolerances.<BR>
 Or it is possible that you are simply due a break in the flare cycle, or it works.  Perhaps Ellen is on to something but it has not been supported by rigorous scrutiny.  There have no controlled studies.  <BR>I would suggest that we not get too defensive.  Take from the diet what works and live and let live.  Those of us that have a science background realize that her science is shaky at best.  Again don't let legitimate scientific concerns demoralize you or anger you.  If it helps you stick with it. <BR><BR>

Dear Noradel, <BR>The only proof I have or need are the results of my last 2 colonoscopies which were taken while I've been on the diet. They show no signs of Ulcerative colitis, and in the place where there once was extensive disease, they now show a totatly healthy colon. May 1st will be 2 years
on the diet for me and although I have recently begun straying &quot;just a
bit&quot;, I do so very tentatively. I've had no reactions to straying yet but am uncomfortable with it and I do make sure to eat my yogurt every day. I've been symtom free for over a year and pray to continue in the same vein. <BR>Love to all, Rachel<BR>

Dear Judy, <BR>I know all too well how skeptical of anything new to try, like this diet, can be for those of us suffering with these diseases. The diet worked very quickly for me (in spit of my skepticism). <BR>Elaine says she has about an
80 percent success rate with people trying this diet. These figures far exceed those that coventional medicine seem to be able to. I agree with you that steroids should be avoided unless ABSOLUTELY necessary. Good luck to you
in finding releif. A good first step would be attempting the diet. <BR>Rachel<BR>

I am slowly coming to the conclusion that the SCD diet, which has given
me my life back <BR>
in many ways, controls the symptoms of UC, but won't cure me. Therefore,
I am THINKING <BR>
of staying on the diet, med-free for 11 months a year, then taking prednisone
and <BR>
asuphazaline for 1 month (or maybe only 2 weeks a year) and treating myself
to daily <BR>
doses of things like Pizza, Ice cream, Beer, Chocolate, bread, rice, pasta,
cake, <BR>
etc.....<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone else feel that they are never going to get fully better, and
that a brief <BR>
time off the diet, with the help of medication, for a short enough period
so as not to <BR>
screw up one's metabolism won't set them back? I base this on the fact that
I've had <BR>
mild relapses, and with the diet, they have sort of gone away (but never
completely, <BR>
except for the occasional day). I believe that I am being extremely strict
in avoiding <BR>
complex carbohydrates...<BR>

I found your posting very interesting. My son (12) has been on the diet
for<BR>
about a year and has done extremely well and has been able to stop all<BR>
medications except for cortenema. We recently had a doctor's appointment
and<BR>
did a couple of hemocult cards to check for microscopic blood in the stool.<BR>
Both samples came back positive which led me to believe that though the
diet<BR>
has helped immensely I am beginning to question whether or not it could<BR>
actually cure my son of Crohn's. <BR>
<BR>
We are fairly rigid with his diet although he has been caught cheating a
few<BR>
times . . after all, he is just a child and hasn't been able to always resist<BR>
temptation at school when a classmate offered something that he really wanted<BR>
to eat. <BR>
<BR>
Your suggestion of taking meds for short periods and enjoying a normal diet<BR>
has crossed my mind in that I'm not so sure that my son will be willing
to<BR>
live under the diet restrictions for the remainder of his life. Of course,<BR>
prednisone and it's problems aren't much of a choice either. One of our
main<BR>
problems (blessings!) is that my son has not suffered with his disease the<BR>
way many of the members of this group have. He had severe nausea, terrible<BR>
&quot;D&quot;, blood loss, but no pain to speak of and all symptoms can
be controlled<BR>
with meds. When he does cheat on the diet, he doesn't experience any pain
or<BR>
discomfort but will have his stools loosen up and show visible blood loss.<BR>
The frequency doesn't even always increase. Needless to say, this doesn't<BR>
act as a great deterrant for not cheating on the diet. The threat of having<BR>
to go back on prednisone and blow up like the Goodyear blimp and suffer
the<BR>
teasing of the kids at school seems to have more of an effect on him.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for rattling on so but this subject has been on my mind ever since
we<BR>
got the results of the hemocult cards. Any other viewpoints would be<BR>
appreciated.<BR>

I've received a few responses to this my posting, and have decided that<BR>
it's a nice fantasy, but Id rather not run the risk of setting myself<BR>
back 3 months, which could happen, with or without medication. I forgot<BR>
just what it was like to be REALLY sick, or all puffed out on<BR>
prednisone....<BR>
<BR>
Thanks everyone for the support. I'm back on the wagon (well, I never<BR>
actually stepped off...)<BR>

Dear Barb,<BR>
<BR>
You say your son has been on the diet for about 1 year and has been able
to<BR>
stop all medications except for cortenema. That is truly wonderful, and<BR>
like Elaine advises in her book, once the last symptom has gone a person<BR>
should stay on the diet strictly for at least one year. I am sure at that<BR>
time things would look much better for anyone having any type of test. We<BR>
hope with Martine to do just that, wait one full year after her last symptom<BR>
before even thinking about eating any food not allowed on the SCD. In fact<BR>
I was just speaking with Elaine last night , she called to see how Martine<BR>
was doing and although she is much improved she still has a way to go. But<BR>
like Elaine says its slow progress and that is good enough for me. At least<BR>
Martine has a life now which she did not this time last year. Martine was<BR>
very ill to the point that her Dr. wanted to remove her colon. The diet
has<BR>
very much helped to settle her disease activity (and save her colon) and
to<BR>
put 25lbs back on, which was very much needed. Her blood work continues
to<BR>
improve monthly. We know its the diet because she has tried everything else<BR>
with no results. I don't know how old your son is but I know it must be<BR>
difficult at school. Martine is 19 , so sticking to the diet with fanatical<BR>
adherence has never been a problem. I guess what I am trying to say is that<BR>
I firmly believe that SCD will cure Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis if<BR>
followed as strickly as Elaine recommonds. The time period is different<BR>
for everyone depending on how sick the person is. Hope this helps. Keep<BR>
Positive!<BR>
<BR>
