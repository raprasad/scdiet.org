<B>question for the ladies please</B><BR>
Tue, 24 Jun 1997 16:56:45 GMT<BR>
<BR>
some of you who are in my age range 40+ please respond to this phenomenon...<BR>
<BR>
i have been monitoring my 'condition' more closely for the past few months...and
i see a definite cycle here. i'm pre-menopausal (i must be though i'm still
quite regular...the calendar on the wall tells me that at my age, i should
be<BR>
there anyway) and i have noticed a definite pattern to my feeling lousy/well
cycles.<BR>
<BR>
i hit the worst 'low' during and immediately after my period...then about
10 days later i start to feel really good...<BR>
<BR>
mostly i think i'm experiencing water retention....i bloat out like a damned
balloon  and get swollen ankles (mostly in the left leg) and aches in the
knees...<BR>
<BR>
then mysteriously, it gets worse for one night...actually keeps me awake..
the pains...<BR>
but that's the turning point...i begin to feel decidedly better for a few
days before it starts all over again.<BR>
<BR>
i just got elaine's book today....a student of mine placed an order with
Amazon and three of us ordered together DHL to reduce shipping costs...what
a wonderful service!!<BR>
<BR>
anyway, i just got home and thought i'd ask you all...first.... now i'll
go read the book!!<BR>
<BR>
thanks.<BR>

&gt;some of you who are in my age range 40+ please respond to this<BR>
&gt;phenomenon...<BR>
<BR>
I'm only 25 but I have noticed the same thing.  I'm sure that this IBD is
affected by our hormone balances.  <BR>
Every time I get my period I start getting some gut symptoms and worry that
it's another flare.  <BR>
When I get cramps, it almost seems like the period cramps are indistinguishable
from Crohn's pain, and I get diarreah usually too. <BR>
Plus, that overall lousy sick feeling that's hard to describe.  <BR>
Usually it turns out that it wasn't a flare after all, and gets better after
the period is over.  <BR>
I wonder if many women with IBD get this pattern.  <BR>
It never used to be this way and has only happened for the past 6 months
or so.<BR>

<B>The female cycle and prostaglandins</B><BR>
Tue, 24 Jun 1997 23:26:57 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Dear Arlene,<BR>
<BR>
I asked a similar question to yours about three months ago and since<BR>
then have learned a lot that helped me and may apply to you as well.<BR>
<BR>
Prostaglandins are the hormones that are secreted related to<BR>
inflammation.  There is an increase of &quot;bad&quot; prostaglandins when
most of<BR>
us have flares of our intestinal stuff and also, we women tend to get<BR>
increased prostaglandins during our periods.  This is why there is often<BR>
added irritation at this time, achiness, bloating.<BR>
<BR>
From the Chinese medical perspective, during our cycles there is often<BR>
an increase in &quot;dampness&quot; (swelling, etc) at this time that is
also<BR>
present with other &quot;damp&quot; conditions, such as arthritis -- if
you have<BR>
any achey problems in general, they would increase during your cycle.<BR>
<BR>
So, what to do about it?  Here's what helps me: several days before your<BR>
period starts, stay away from all foods you are even remotely sensitive<BR>
to.  For me this means I eat a bland vegetable and chicken diet,<BR>
borring, but the results are worth it.  Also, taking Omega-3 oils, as in<BR>
flaxseed and primrose oil, will help diminish the bad prostaglandin<BR>
response.<BR>
<BR>
I used to have terrible periods where I just dragged and ached the whole<BR>
time, felt like a zombie.  Since I started paying strict (even stricter<BR>
than usual -- eliminating all sugars at that time) attention to my food<BR>
and increased my Omega-3, I actually have even higher energy than usual<BR>
during my period, which I consider a small miracle.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck.<BR>
<BR>

Dear Arlene,<BR>
I turned 50 in January and began menopause about a year ago. My periods
are<BR>
real screwy. Since my UC is under control, I find no relation to my cycles,<BR>
however I have spondylitis which is an IBD related arthritis and without
a<BR>
doubt when I'm about to get a period, my joints react and badly. I feel
as<BR>
though I'm walking around with a 300 lb. man sitting on my shoulders. The<BR>
pain involves each and every one of my joints, from the neck down. I'm also<BR>
severely affected by weather changes and here on LI, they are a common<BR>
occurance. Last week we went from 60 and dry one day to 90 and humid the<BR>
next. Thought I'd die. I almost didn't make it to work. I fight real hard<BR>
not to let my disease get the better of me or in any way change my daily<BR>
patterns. I think I'm terrified that if I allow the pain to gain even a<BR>
tiny victory, I'll lose ground real fast. Wishing you all the best.<BR>
