<b>I have been filled with hope when I thought I had come to the end of the road. My daughter (21 yrs.) has battled with UC for the last 4 yrs. Now, we feel we have some ammunition to swing the battle in our favor. She will be starting the diet soon. I believe this is our answer. Prayers of support to all who suffer and to all who love the ones who suffer.

<!--<b>Firt time visitor..my daughter was diagnosed with CD after five surgeries within one year.  She has had a couple of flare ups, and as a manager for a well known restaurant, she is mortified that she is 35 and is $%#$ in her pants.  This is all new to her and she is still adjusting.  Would appreciate any advice you can give me to help her.  I am looking also for some type of support group that she could talk with as she gets really frustrated.  She is on medication but will have to find out what she is taking.  She uses a anti-diaareah (sp) and that does help.  She knows that I am supporting her, but feel that if she had people she could talk to that could TOTALLY relate to what she is going through, I think it would help her.  Any ideas????  I also would like to know aobut this diet that is mentioned several times here.  Seems to work for a number of people, and she is willing to try anything.  Thanks for listening...ah reading....</b><br>

        <!--<b>Hi, my name is Sheila I have probably had occasional IBD since my early 20s, 20 years ago.  I have been diagnosed with "either" illeitis or crohn's disease since 5 months ago in June 2001. The doctor said he wasn't sure.  Plus, he doesn't know if the ulcerative colitis came first or not.  All I know is throughout the years I would have loose movements occasionally, especially in the mornings, which I would attribute to "plain" ole food intolerances.  But, It would take longer for my intestine to normalize each time as the years went by.  Stress would also complicate things.  I asked an OB GYN about menstruation upsetting the stomach;He said sometimes the blood can get into the stomach.  It wasn't until around Nov. 2000-a year ago that my disease really kicked in when back trouble started and I reluctantly went to the chiropractor.  The adjustments were'nt helping, and gave me trouble just sitting down.
Then simultaniously I was having a new front sensation of pain above my legs that I have ongoingly still--the ulcerative colitis.  In the past, starting before that, I believed the starting illium pain was "just" soreness from a build up of gas pressure.  I started going to my primary doctor 8 mos. ago in March 2001 who had me on a (very bloating) stomach relaxer, and then a kind of stomach acid "dryer upper"  which seemed to dry up my nose and mouth to an extreme, but not reduce any pain.
He then referred me to the gastrointestinal doctor whos office couldn't get me in until a whole mo. later.  I had been getting backup into the GI track-up into my stomach and the esophigus and the heartburn was icky, so forced the GI office for advice in the meantime.
I was able to get an upper GI referral from the "primary"
doctor's office previous to finally seeing the GI doctor.
Because of all the waiting and trying to figure what was happening inside me,  the ulcerative colitis got worse up to a mo. ago even though I had gotten into that appt. with the GI doctor, had gone through a couple of blood tests, a colonoscopy, and a final lower GI.  He had initially put me on pentasa 16/day (taking 4-4x/day) along with prevacid 12 hr. release, told me to come back in 2 mos. and then when I did, told him I was especially having lower left colon pain
to which he says, go off the (anti-inflammitory) pentasa because the amount of inflammation doesn't warrant it now, but stay on the prevacid (anti-acid) and come back in 6 mos.
a couple weeks later the pain in both areas was still staying the same.  I found Elaine's SC-diet on the internet
and initially somehow got a whole week of relief even though I found I needed to read into it better.  Toward that recent visit with the GI doctor, He had said to reduce grains, potatoes, dairy and sweets, meats were ok and to eat fresh veggies and fruits;so thought I'd do one better and try the scd which seemed reasonable. I've seen some improvement enough going into a second better concentrated mo. on the diet.  I've found that blending (softening) foods correct me until I've fully learned to eliminate problem foods still in my kitchen. My doctor didn't tell me to puree foods unfortunatly, but its been an enormous help. Since this all started consistantly back in Nov. 2000,  I have lost 15 lbs. total,  so am trying to also gain it back some with alot of the yogurt made with the whole milk, eating the chicken skins as someone suggested (and drinking the  drippings-that drip into the water below the broiling chicken.  The small, and softer constant meals, keeps the ulcers and crohns down which is the most important thing to me right now.  To really get going I have been drinking GNC store's brand of lactobacillus acidophilus-- blend of the lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidus and bulgaricus cultures, although I've just read that instead of the "bulgaricus part" that "salivarius" was a good "partial" replacement for ulcerative colitis.  THANKS ELAINE!  It's been a long year with I guess another 2 to really get this food thing down pat and recoop with two children to raise to boot and my husband is understanding some of it now.
Hope this helps someone,
Sheila

years, and now he's on the SCD.  We're still learning how to follow it, find
products, and read labels.  I signed up for the newsletter but haven't received
anything yet.  Is this how I ask a question about the diet?  Thanks for letting

 - What if your diagnosis is ULCERATIVE PROCTITIS and your problem isn't diarrhea
but rather severe CONSTIPATION?  I've only recently started the SCD, but I fear
it's not giving me the roughage I used to get from some of my old carb friends
(i.e. the Metamucil wafers my doctor prescribed).  Any suggestions/ success
stories would be greatly appreciated!   <BR>

 - I was so pleased to stumble across Elaine's book and your website. I was
diagnosed with UC Nov97 and am just getting over my 2nd flare up. I'm on my 4th
day of the diet and feeling better already although it's hard to tell whether
it's the diet or drugs at the moment. My Dr isn't the least bit supportive, it's
an isolating experience IBD. Thanks Guys!      <BR>

<P>Dear Mik,
<P>I always wondered who this mysterious &quot;Mik&quot; was that had the great
SCD
website! Have you been on our list all along? Just thought I'd drop
you a line to thank you for all your hard work and to tell you that your
site has been a real blessing to my handband (Crohn's Disease) and I as
we struggle to cure his illness, or, at the very least, put it into
remission. God bless you.

<P>Dear Michelle,
<P>Thanks a lot for your letter. It is very nice to hear that.<BR>
Yes, I have been on the list for about three years soon, so I guess that is more
or less &quot;all along&quot;.<BR>
But at times I have been &quot;away&quot; for months, and then at one point,
getting myself together and spending a whole Sunday on reading through thousands
of pages of mails...
<P>I wish you the best with the struggle towards cure.<BR>
Get well soon!
<P>Personally, I have been on the SCD for about two and a half year now, and I
have found that for me, it takes even more than the SCdiet alone to make it
happen. 
It has been necessary for me to add things like: daily exercise, a good eight
hours nights sleep (every night!), vitamine supplements, and to refrain totally
from alcohol, coffee, milk products, red meat, raisins, etc...
<P>Yours,<BR>
Mik

hyperactive thyroid? Is there any people with Crohn's that have this thyroid

tried it now that I have developed this thyroid condition -- possibly due an

Feb., while her Prednisone was 10mg/day & 5-ASA was 1000mg/day. We have gradually
reduced Pred. to 3mg/day. Starting in March her Diarrhea came back 1x/day, but no
bleeding. We have continued the diet and reducing Pred. She gets mostly meat, nut
bread, (see continuation) <BR>
