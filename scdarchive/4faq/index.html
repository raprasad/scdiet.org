                &quot;I have been on the diet for 5 1/2 months and I can tell 
                you that there is no looking back. I feel better than I have ever 
                in my life and I'm not even symptom-free. If you have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0969276818/goodbooks/">the 
                book </a>start with the beginner diet on page 51. If you have 
                trouble finding the Dry Curd Cottage Cheese (a.k.a DCCC) go to 
                the website: scdiet.org and go to Resources section or let us 
                know where you live and maybe we can help you. The Chicken soup 
                is wonderful. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here is what 
                I ate in the beginning: Breakfast: yogurt, boiled egg (if no diarrhea), 
                grape juice lunch: chicken soup, broiled beef patty sometimes 
                with cheese on it but be careful. Supper: a lot of the same stuff. 
                I started to feel so much better within a week. Definitely not 
                perfect but no more gas or bloating. <a href="/||ARCHIVE_SUBDIRECTORY||/5community/SCDLI.html">Ask

                Nature's Internal Healers</u>, by Natasha Trenev: "Fructooligosaccharides, 
                more commonly known as FOS, is a class of simple carbohydrates 
                found naturally in certain plants, such as Jerusalem artichokes, 
                onions, and bananas. A Japanese process is utilized in turning 
                white, bleached cane sugar, by the action of a fungal enzyme, 
                into FOS - a sugar polymer that our bodies cannot digest.&quot; 
                FOS (in the form of inulin) is added to some commercial yogurts 
                to make their probiotics more &quot;bio-available&quot;. Elaine

            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes! Here's 
                what Elaine says. The carbohydrates that we consider legal in 
                SCD are plentiful but are easily absorbed as they required minimal 
                digestive capability. There have been many, many SCD babies born. 
                Mothers were on SCD throughout pregnancy and some were big and 
                some were normal (7-8 lbs and some were a bit less than 7 lbs). 
                But as you know, diabetics (on insulin, not considered people 
                in the best of health) have unusually fat babies. I understand 
                it is because of high sugar levels. On the other side if you are 
                pregnant and do not eat enough simple carbs, I believe it can 
                be dangerous to the point where you will have a smaller baby and 
                I will not go into the unending debate about just burning fat 
                and protein. So, in summary, the SCD diet has proven healthful 
                for pregnancy provided that you have sufficient LEGAL CARBOHYDRATES. 
                For example, homemade applesauce if you cannot handle raw apples. 
                Homemade muffins if you cannot eat grains. etc. etc. etc.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's what 
                Karen says. I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 7 years ago, 
                and made the decision to go on SCD at the end of August last year. 
                I can honestly say it was the best decision I have ever made! 
                My symptoms cleared up almost immediately, fortunately (not everyone 
                feels so good so quickly), and I am now 8 weeks pregnant! I, too, 
                had lots of questions about the diet and pregnancy, especially 
                since my cravings were leaning toward "illegal" foods. That is 
                actually how I came to the list as well. I have been assured by 
                everyone on the list that the SCD IS THE HEALTHIEST THING I CAN 
                DO FOR ME AND MY BABY. I also talked it over with my doctor, and 
                after giving her a food journal of what I eat, she was amazed 
                at how incredibly HEALTHY the diet is. So everything is a-ok, 
                and although it has taken some time to learn about foods and how 
                to prepare everything from "scratch", and it definitely takes 
                perserverence and courage to maintain, I am very sure that this 
                is the way I want to live, and want my baby to live. Remember, 
                when you have a disease that is characterized by malabsorbtion, 
                anything you eat that cannot be digested properly will NOT feed 
                you, and therefore NOT feed your baby!!!!! Best of luck with your 
                pregnancy, and I hope we will see you on this list often!</font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the same 
                way, when I had our miracle with the SCD, I started at step one 
                and attempted to understand it for many years, 12 of which we 
                spent studying just about everything in medical science and in 
                the university. I realized that we were trying to avoid fermentable 
                carbs and thereby feed the person rather than the microorganisms. 
                My perspective has been that basic tenet. During that 12 years, 
                I started carbohydrate chemisty a great deal. I learned about 
                fructooligsaccharides before it was a "twinkle in the eyes" of 
                the present day people who are hyping it. I knew it was indigestible 
                and I knew it was quite suspicious as a compound to be ever used 
                with SCD. When it first began to be hyped, a few of the very conscientious 
                GI specialists called me and we discussed it and we agreed it 
                was the last thing we should use. Then, of course, a group of 
                researchers in Belgium (and I di not know who supported their 
                research) came out and said how great FOS was to grow beneficial 
                bacteria in the gut. I think I am one of the oldtimers who is 
                looking at this (not for research paid by those with vested interest) 
                but by basic understanding of the SCD and food. </font></p>

                I attend a conference (and I wasn't able to do this for the last 
                two years with Herb and Alzheimer's) I would look for confirmation 
                or contradiction of my understanding. </font></p>

                conference at Christ Church, Oxford University sponsored by the 
                Birtish Society of Sllergy, Evnironment and Nutrtional Medicine. 
                Dr. Hugh Dunstan of the University of Newcaste of New South Wales, 
                Australia presented work he had done which showed that in a medium 
                containing FOS, the growth of Clostridium was huge far outgrowing 
                other bacteria in FOS medium. No one questioned him except me. 
                He scratched his head when I asked "why are the Clostridium growing 
                at this exponential rate" and he laughed and said "we wondered 
                about it too." </font></p>

                you are determining the rate by which sugars and starches enter 
                the bloodstream and the slower they enter the bloodstream, the 
                better you judge them to be re raising the blood sugar levels 
                slowly rather than erratically. However, are you ALSO testing 
                to determine if some of these starches are being digested and 
                absorbed at all? In other words, is it not possible that the ones 
                you determine as the good ones since they lower the blood sugar 
                very little, if at all, are not even being absorbed??? They answered

                us on SCD - they are doing nothing to raise our blood sugar levels

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your thoughts 
                about the fatigue are very perceptive. How and why can such a 
                normal intake of food, although quite different than previous 
                intake, create such a huge difference in how you feel? It is fascinating; 
                is not new to us; and says to me that you are reverting back to 
                HUMAN digestion rather than RUMEN (like a herbivore's stomach) 
                digestion. In other words, the bacterial fermentation process 
                is not efficient for giving you all the energy from the calories 
                of food.<br>
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The volatile 
                fatty acids which are produced by bacteria or yeast in the lower 
                part of the ileum and colon are actually the part of the glucose 
                molecule which contains the greatest amount of energy. Are they 
                being absorbed into the bloodstream efficiently or just passing 
                out with the feces??? I do not know. But it is not supposed to 
                be bacterial fermentation byproducts that allow the calories of 
                food to be absorbed; we should be absorbing them from our small 
                intestine (23 feet of it).<br>
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For those 
                of you who have had any biochemistry or cellular nutrition, the 
                molecule of glucose has the potential of allowing each cell to 
                manufacture 38 molecules of cellular energy or ATP (adenosine 
                triphosphate). If we do not absorb the glucose molecules (from 
                starch, disaccharides, or even monosaccharides) from our absorptive 
                small intestine, they go down to the microbial world. There, very 
                INEFFICIENT anerobic bacteria get only 2 molecules of the possible 
                38 and pass the rest off as volatile fatty acids. What is happening 
                to these volatile fatty acids. Are we passing them out as diarrhea 
                contents? Are some being absorbed through the ileum wall and colonic 
                wall? I do not know. I would doubt it very much if much of them 
                are being absorbed. Once you change the digestive process by starving 
                out the critters and absorbing the legal sugars more efficiently, 
                you will then be getting our HUMAN DIGESTION working correctly 
                and our cells will get 38 molecules of ATP from one molecule of 
                glucose. </font></p>
