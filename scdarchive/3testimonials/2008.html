              Date: Jan 3, 2008</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I began the 
              diet Sept 2006 for Ulcerative Colitis. I was on steroids for 3 years 
              and had to begin Remicade March 2006. After starting the diet my 
              symptoms were gone by Jan 2007 and I have been great since then. 
              I also have Lupus and it is felt that the Remicade may have induced 
              a flare. I was afraid to stop the Remicade for fear of a flare up. 
              However, I have been off the Remicade since the summer of 2007 with 
              no symptoms. My Remicade levels had been next to zero and my antibodies 
              were elevated showing that the Remicade wasn't working except for 
              the side effects leading me to believe that the diet had been working 
              all along.<br>
              Even when I am able to begin eating certain foods again, I will 
              never go back to the way I ate again. This diet has truly changed 
              my life. I have more energy and memory since starting the diet. 
              I am a Nurse 
              Practitioner in an emergency department and just completed a Doctoral 
              program in Nursing. Something I don't think I could have finished 
              without the diet.<br>

              I saw my GI doctor in July of 2007, he refused to acknowledge the 
              benefits of the SCD diet.... My parents and I walked out, and we

              Date: Oct 14, 2008</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I was 
              diagnosed with AS in 2000 and last year (2007) I had the first symptoms 
              of Crohn's disease. I started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) 
              in Feb of 2008 and I don't feel any need to take any medications 
              not even the simple ones like Aleve. The process is long and requires 
              patience and modifications of the SCD. For example, beyond the complex 
              carbohydrates I don't eat any milk products and a month ago I was 
              sensitive to red meat. However lately I can eat pork meat without 
              any significant inflammation. I don't eat anything that is made 
              by others or has conservatives. Fish is my first choice for protein 
              and lots of fruits or vegetables for all the necessary carbs or 
              vitamins. I am actually thinking to start writing a book about my 
              experience on SCD and my disease(s) with all the required scientific 
              background. In case somebody needs advice gained through my own 
              experience with Crohn's. I hope more people get benefit from the 
              Elaine's work and so many others that contributed to broaden our 
              knowledge on this chronic disease. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A group of scientists 
              found genetic associations of UC and Crohn's with specific genes 
              (ARTS1 and IL23R) which means that soon a better and more effective 
              medication will be developed by the pharmaceutical industry. I hope 
              it won't take long time to do the clinical trials. Published online:

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;First 
              of all a huge thank you for doing this site.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was never 
              diagnosed with colitis but by deduction they figured that was it. 
              This diet is amazing, I knew in 3 days it was working. I had the 
              pattern ... love for carbos, bad bout with antibiotics ... erythromycin 
              was a killer drug for me. I had to have it 2 times and the second 
              time I literally was shaking so bad I could hardly hold the phone 
              when I called the hospital. The nurse flippantly said &quot;Oh you 
              are probably allergic, just stop them&quot;. Then 3 days later I 
              was never the same, chronic runs with up to 6 movements a day. I 
              thought I had a flu that wouldn't go away. I was light and than 
              lost 20 lbs. I thought i had cancer. Medical system was very slow 
              and pointed to stress. I tried ascol which just went straight through 
              me and the pill didn't even break down when it went through me. 
              I gave up on doctors and tried everything.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally and 
              thankfully a friend saw Elaine on Oprah and told me about the book. 
              I thought I have nothing more to lose. Than after a quick read, 
              and 3 days I knew I was on the right track.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ONE KEY THING 
              ... when I really stick to the diet, it seems that I do not get 
              colds, my immunity it stronger, I sleep better, I am more stable, 
              all things are much better. Trouble is I have such a sweet tooth. 
              Anyways my tummy doesn't bloat and things slow down.</font></p>

My specialist has told me many   times if I hadn&rsquo;t been on the diet, these past years, I would be dead.   God, is my divine physician, He&rsquo;s used the diet to keep me well these   past 6 years. I&rsquo;ve travelled to <span id="lw_1304264004_1">Thailand</span> on a mission trip, spent a week in Mexico, and have been on 2 cruises,   all the while faithfully sticking to my diet. With much prayer I&rsquo;ve had   long periods of good health &amp; 6 years of remission. I had a flare up   this past Dec. so I&rsquo;m now on Remicade, thankfully I&rsquo;ve had no side   effects. I&rsquo;ve had only 2 surgeries, 1st one in <span id="lw_1304264004_2">Hawaii</span>,   God is my lifeline and this diet has been a life saver as well! I&rsquo;m   extremely interested in helping others find better health thru this   SCdiet. It&rsquo;s truly life-giving!&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;My partner has had Ulcerative Colitis Chronically for the last 4 years   now, with chronic diarrhea four to six times a day with blood. We are   from Australia and for the last year I have been researching all sorts   of diets, he's tried herbal treatments other diets and lots of   supplement etc but to no avail. I read about the Specific Carbohydrate   diet and ordered the book breaking the vicious cycle. He started the   diet about 3 weeks ago, the first week he had a lot of symptoms but he   felt it was like a detox occurring, within about two weeks the symptoms   have subsided and now only 3 weeks later he has no diarrhea only goes   about 2 times a day with formed stools and no blood. He also feels so   much healthier and loves the food- even though a bit more cooking for   me. I am so impressed by this wonderful diet and it has been such a   relief to see him have such a dramatic improvement in such a sort time.   Wanted to write&nbsp; this to you.&quot;<br>
