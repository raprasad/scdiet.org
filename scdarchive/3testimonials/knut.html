                    Subject: EXPERIENCES FROM ONE YEAR ON THE SCD DIET<br>
                    <br>
                    This is my story of 15 years with UC and with a particular 
                    focus on the last 12 months on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.<br>
                    <br>
                    DIAGNOSE UC<br>
                    I ( 33 years, male) was diagnosed with UC when I was 18 years 
                    old. At that time I was a high school student and the first 
                    sign of the disease was more frequent bowel movements. The 
                    next sign was passage of stool mixed with blood. My doctor 
                    made some examinations and test and then gave me the diagnosis 
                    of UC.<br>
                    <br>
                    MEDICATION<br>
                    I was then put on 4x500 mg Salazopyrin per day. In periods 
                    in remission I have been down on 2 x 500 mg. For app. the 
                    last 5 years I have been on Pentasa 2-3 x 50 mg a day.<br>
                    During flare-ups I have been medicated with preds.<br>
                    <br>
                    SYMPTOMS<br>
                    Compared to many other who suffers from IBD I guess I am a 
                    lucky person. My UC (proctitis) is located to the rectum. 
                    I used to have regularly flare-ups twice a year. During flare-ups 
                    I had 1-3 more bowel movements per day, never diarrhea. Flare-ups 
                    starts with a period with gas, then passage of stools mixed 
                    with mucus and finally passage of stools mixed with blood 
                    and mucus. I have had some minor joint pains. All in all I 
                    have been able to live a normal life. I have never been away 
                    from work because of my UC. Still, the thought of having to 
                    eat medicine for 50 years did not attract me to much. <br>
                    <br>
                    PREDS<br>
                    My flare-ups have been harder to control for each year. The 
                    first years the disease went in remission by itself. For the 
                    last years my doctor has prescribed 15 - 30 mg prednisolon 
                    a day for periods of two weeks. My last flare-up started in 
                    October 96 and ended in December. After two weeks on the preds, 
                    my nose started bleeding. I guess for me the preds is the 
                    worst aspect with the disease. During the last flare-up I 
                    also had some very<br>
                    irritating itching which I never had before. <br>
                    <br>
                    BREAKING THE VICIOUS CYCLE<br>
                    In October / November 96 I was searching the internet for 
                    more info about UC and found a lot of interesting information. 
                    I also read about Elaine Gottschall's book &quot;Breaking 
                    the vicious cycle&quot; and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. 
                    On a trip to the USA in December I found the book in a bookstore. 
                    I decided to try the diet. Since I have had regularly flare-ups 
                    2 times a year I decided to follow the diet for at least one 
                    year to see if the diet had an effect and to be able to make 
                    a conclusion. It couldn't hurt, the diet seemed nutritious.<br>
                    I started the diet in January 97 and have followed it for 
                    12 months. I have not had any flare-ups since I started the 
                    diet. When I started the diet I also decided to follow my 
                    medication (Pentasa) as normal. For some reason I stopped 
                    eating drugs in April 97, so the last 9 months I have been 
                    without drugs. (I do not recommend others to this without 
                    consulting a doctor) </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SIGNS 
                    OF UC<br>
                    As I said, no flare-ups the last year but 3 -4 times I have 
                    felt this itching but not as irritating as during the last 
                    flare-up. If this is connected to my UC I don't know. Three 
                    times I have noticed very small amounts of blood in my stools. 
                    The next days there have been no visual<br>
                    signs. No mucus and gas when during a &quot;normal&quot; flare-up. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LIVING 
                    ON A DIET<br>
                    I am very fond of food. Before starting the diet I ate almost 
                    all kinds of food, and I could hardly imagine my self on a 
                    strict diet. My motivation was high and I have been able to 
                    follow the diet without cheating to much. Even the diet is 
                    hard to follow it was easier than I thought. <br>
                    <br>
                    CHEATING<br>
                    I have not been on this diet without cheating. For those of 
                    you who know the diet:<br>
                    - I have been drinking beer occasionally.<br>
                    - 1-2 times a month I have been eating small amounts of potatoes 
                    or rice. (at restaurants) <br>

                    SEEING MY DOCTOR<br>
                    Last time I had an appointment with my doctor was in September 
                    96, two weeks before my last flare-up. My next appointment 
                    was in September 97. I did not look forward to telling him 
                    about the diet and particularly not to tell him I had stopped 
                    taking my drugs. (He always tells me how important it is to 
                    take them.) Totally unexpected he reacted positively to the 
                    diet. I lend him my copy of the book and a printout of Wolfgang 
                    Lutz's book<br>
                    (found on Mik's Web page). After a couple of weeks he send 
                    me a letter where he agreed with many of the conclusions and 
                    that refined sugar is a greater danger to peoples health than 
                    fat.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    CONCLUSIONS<br>
                    I have now been on the diet for 12 months. 9 months without 
                    drugs. No flare-ups.<br>
                    Since all my previous flare-ups has been pretty regular ( 
                    twice a year) I think there are reasons to believe that this 
                    diet has an effect on my disease. Even though the diet is 
                    hard to follow I will continue the diet. If I can manage to 
                    stay off drugs on this diet there is no doubt what I want 
                    to do.<br>
                    <br>
                    WHAT NEXT<br>
                    My next milestone will now be my next appointment with my 
                    doctor in April, and I am looking forward to see him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Finally I wish you all a healthy and a happy new year.<br>
                    <br>
                    regards<br>
