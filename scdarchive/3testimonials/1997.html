              <br>

              I heard the distress in your message. That's OK, you have every 

              right to be anxious. However, don't let it swallow you up. Fill 

              your mind with positive images. Our minds play a HUGE role in healing 

              our bodies. I was diagnosed with UC in May 1996, and I started the 

              diet in August, 1996. I haven't cheated yet.<br>

              <br>

              At its worst, the UC produced severe ulcers throughout the colon. 

              I stayed up most nights with pain and diarrhea. I needed to go about 

              20 times every 24 hours. It was a living hell. <br>

              <br>

              I think the UC began during a stressful marriage about 3 years ago. 

              At that time I experienced pain only in my lower abdomen and I thought 

              it was just a part of nearing 30. The horrible symptoms began after 

              I left my husband and moved back with my mom and dad. Soon afterwards, 

              my father had a heart attack. Stress! Stress! Stress! <br>

              <br>

              Anyway, I digress. At the time of my UC diagnosis in May I was given 

              Asacol which was supposed to eliminate the diarrhea but only reduced 

              the pain. In June the doctor prescribed prednisone for 40 days. 

              It did wonders for my running but made no difference in the pain. 

              <br>

              <br>

              In August I started the SCD diet and by September I began to feel 

              a difference. It was not a dramatic change but a gradual improvement. 

              Everyone differs in his/her reaction to this diet. Since you asked 

              how to tell if the diet is working for you, I caution you not to 

              be discouraged if you don't improve immediately. Even though I didn't 

              experience dramatic changes, I am getting better and my body is 

              healing. <br>

              <br>

              After four months on the diet, the pain has gone way down. Sometimes 

              I go 4 days in a row with no pain before it creeps back for a day. 

              But I don't haven the severe pain that I felt back in May.<br>

              <br>

              As well as the diet I am using my own form of mental imagery. I 

              pick times that I feel good to engage in serious daydreaming. I 

              imagine the ulcers are surrounded by healthy tissue and slowly disappearing. 

              I hope my experience with the diet has helped you. Perhaps an ND 

              can help you figure out if this diet is working for you.<br>

              <br>

              My story:<br>

              <br>

              I'm now 48. Last November I was diagnosed with CD. I consider myself 

              lucky in that my symptoms were mild: six daily bm's, but no diarrhea. 

              The inflammation was mostly inside my anus--I had mild inflammation 

              and crusting in the perianal region for almost a year and a half 

              before my diagnosis. Three doctors, including my colon and rectal 

              doc, initially failed to correctly identify my illness as Crohn's 

              disease. <br>

              <br>

              Eventually I was diagnosed with CD and prescribed sulfasalazine. 

              It stopped the bleeding and somewhat improved my worsening skin 

              condition. However, it did nothing for the mucus or the gas .<br>

              <br>

              Thanks to the internet, I found out about the specific carbohydrate 

              diet. About three weeks ago I tried it and noticed a dramatic improvement 

              in my skin condition by the following morning!<br>

              <br>

              Since Elaine stresses the importance of not taking vitamins that 

              contain starch fillers so I checked with the pharmacy and the drug 

              manufacturer and found out that my sulfasalazine pills had starch. 

              So I checked with my doctor (who had originally said that Crohn's 

              was not related to diet) and he recommended that I keep taking the 

              pills--there wouldn't be any dire consequences if I didn't.<br>

              <br>

              Eight days later the doctor he said I was much improved inside and 

              out. He agreed that the diet might have something to do with it. 

              However, maybe to save face, he added that the improvement might 

              also be due to the medicine that was still in my system. He admitted 

              that if my condition continued to improve by the time I saw him 

              the next month, then the diet and not the drug would get the credit. 

              My appointment is coming up and I continue to improve.<br>

              <br>

              Now I'm ahead in two ways: getting healed from the disease, and 

              not having to contend with the frequent bouts of fatigue that were 

              side effects of the drug. Like others who have posted here, I've 

              exposed my doctor to valuable information he never learned in medical 

              school.<br>

              one year later)</b><br>

              <font color="#999999">Fri, 2 May 1997 18:18:06 GMT</font><br>

              <br>

              Hello SCDers<br>

              <br>

              May 1 is a milestone for me since it marks the date I began the 

              SCD in 1996. I'm compelled to celebrate it by relating some of my 

              experience. I hope that newcomers to the diet will find this encouraging.<br>

              <br>

              Eight years ago I was diagnosed with CD the terminal ileum. A year 

              ago I began the SCD because my new GI doc wanted to wean me from 

              the prednisone that I had been taking for the previous 3-4 years 

              (10 - 15mg/day). I was scared since I had never had relief from 

              the CD symptoms and my condition was getting worse. In addition 

              to the prednisone, I also took 4g pentasa/day, and immodium as needed. 

              I heard about the diet on one of the internet IBD sources and figured 

              that I had nothing to lose.<br>

              <br>

              Now, a year later, I feel that I'm on the road to recovery or remission 

              or normalcy (choose your description). I am SO THANKFUL to have 

              found the diet. I'm not 100 percent yet but the quality of life 

              is vastly improved. I am no longer taking ANY prescription meds 

              and I can't recall the last time I took an immodium. I travel regularly 

              for my job and I no longer need to plan my day or map my route according 

              to the location of rest rooms. I'm sure that there are people in 

              this group that understand what a relief that is.<br>

              <br>

              I heartily eat salads, fresh fruits, and vegetables. I eat meat 

              almost daily and make use of Gottschall's directions in preparation. 

              I snack on monster cookies, cheese, and raw cashews with powdered 

              salt. I've been experimenting with a SCD-friendly recipe for beef 

              or venison jerky in preparation for a sea kayaking trip this summer. 

              I do not suffer from a boring diet thanks to the recipes collected 

              from this forum and a little creativity.<br>

              <br>

              I view the SCD as an answer to prayer (I know that my family has 

              prayed on my behalf for years). I have gently encouraged others 

              to try the diet and will continue to do so. <br>

              <br>

              In my experience, following the diet is hardest in the beginning 

              but it soon becomes habit once one gets in the routine of buying 

              the same groceries and doing the same preparation. To newcomers: 

              don't underestimate the importance of the SCD yogurt. To all of 

              you: thanks for the recipes, the encouragement, and the enthusiasm. 

              <br>

              <br>

              All the best Tim (looking forward to May 1 1998)</font></p>

              <br>

              Hi there,<br>

              <br>

              After completing my first month on the SCD diet, I thought I'd send 

              a note to say hello, but especially to thank all of you for your 

              kindness in sharing info and experiences with the SCD diet. I am 

              28 years old, and live in Raleigh, North Carolina.<br>

              <br>

              Even though it's been only one month, the diet has been a huge help 

              to me. <br>

              I actually enjoy eating now. I have UC and was on prednisone for 

              approx 5 years before being switched to Imuran back in Jan. (I also 

              take Asacol, 12 tablets a day.) The good news is (under my doctor's 

              supervision) I tapered off the Imuran last Tuesday and am feeling 

              great. This is the first time I've successfully been off heavy meds 

              in MANY years. The diet has a lot to do with my success.<br>

              <br>

              Want to know a secret? You have to promise not to tell my in-laws 

              yet. :)<br>

              My husband and I want to start a family! It is a very exciting time, 

              but also scary, in relation to having UC. My GI doc wanted me to 

              consider surgery first (j-pouch...removal of the entire colon), 

              but after speaking with a GI surgeon and a high-risk pregnancy OB, 

              they both felt, for my situation, I could try pregnancy first. I 

              showed Elaine's book to all three docs. Two out of the three seemed 

              optimistic in my trying it.<br>

              <br>

              Has anyone out there had experience with being on the diet while 

              pregnant? Do any of you have any thoughts or knowledge about whether 

              the diet is healthy for a pregnant woman? (Also, I'd love to converse 

              with anyone who has UC and who has gone through pregnancy.)<br>

              <br>

              In closing, if you're in the Raleigh, NC. area, here's some locations 

              of where I found items related to the SCD diet:<br>

              - farmer cheese - Hannaford Grocery store (on Capital blvd.), and 

              also WellSpring Grocery store. (Make sure to ask for farmer's cheese. 

              They had no idea what dry curd cottage cheese was.)<br>

              - Plain yogurt (with only the ingredients Elaine mentions) - WellSpring 

              Grocery store<br>

              - Yogourmet starter (if you can tolerate this as some people on 

              this list mentioned they can) - WellSpring Grocery store<br>

              - Multi-vitamin (with no additives) - WellSpring Grocery Store (brand 

              name is Solgar)<br>

              <br>

              Finally, I use a Salton yogurt maker which I ordered via the internet. 

              It works great. I now eat homemade yogurt on a daily basis.<br>

              <br>

              Wishing you all well!<br>

              <br>

              Sincerely,<br>

              <br>

              Hello SCD group, I'm new here in the group and have really been 

              enjoying reading all the entries. <br>

              <br>

              I've been following the diet for 4 years now. I had been battling 

              ulcerative colitis for over 15 years before I stumbled across the 

              diet on a Canadian TV show. I was at that time planning on having 

              my colon removed. I was steadily losing the little bit of bowel 

              control I had up to that point. The way I best describe my experience 

              with the diet is that having regained my health once again beats 

              having won a 100 million dollar lottery. I feel just that lucky, 

              or luckier!<br>

              After 3 months I can say that I am back to normal. It took a while, 

              but by the third month on the diet, I was getting better each week. 

              Now all the symptoms have gone and I am living my life again. To 

              anyone starting out just stisk to it . As far as what to swy to 

              people, I'v found that just explaining that I am<br>

              following a diet for medical reasons to get rid of an illness. When 

              asked for more info, sometimes just saying I've got Colitis is enough. 

              Sometimes they are interested and I'll explain without getting into 

              too much detail. I say that it is not a diet that restricts me to 

              certain foods, but one where I am just avoiding certain ones. I 

              am always amazed that people are<br>

              so interested in hearing more, and the real shocker is finding out 

              how many people have this damned disease. Seems like everyone has 

              a father, sister, brother-in-law or whatever who has it. I've yet 

              to meet anyone who is offended or put out by my not eating some 

              food or other. Ijust tell them that after living a completely screwed 

              up life, this diet is working and I'm sticking to it.<br>

              I find now that if I eat something and it gives me gas, although 

              it is annoying and sometimes discomforting, I can't tell you how 

              wonderful it is to just pass wind and not to have to run to the 

              can then change my pants!!!!<br>

              <br>

              I have to say that the diet has worked for me very well with no 

              real proplems along the way. It did take a while , sure, but I just 

              kept to it and results followed. I will stay on it for a long time 

              to come. I wouldn't go back for the world! I think the important 

              thing as many have said is to just find out which foods seem to 

              affect you negatively and be aware. There are so many foods that 

              are &quot;allowed&quot;. Good luck to all, and I'm happy to be part 

              of the list that has helped me get my life back.<br>

              Dear Bill,<br>

              Reading your letter gave me the chills. How in the world, when you 

              go through life beleiving that no-one can possibly know how you've 

              had to live from bathroon to bathroom, from soiled underwear to 

              soiled underwear, does someone come along and describe everything 

              exactly as you've lived it. Thankfully, including how wonderful 

              it is to alive and whole and living<br>

              every day to it's fullest. All this by simply avoiding certain foods. 

              How amazing is that?? Freinds who've known me for years and no that 

              I don't ever stick to a &quot;diet&quot; tell me constantly that 

              predicted I'd be doing this one, for maybe a week. How do I explain 

              to them, that this isn't a diet, it's my life.<br>

              Hi Monica,<br>

              <font color="#800080"> <br>

              </font> I have been on the diet for about 3 years, although I have 

              cheated a few times here and there, I must confess. Elaine Gottschall 

              has saved my life! If I hadn't tuned the car radio to Dr. Ronald 

              Hoffman's program one day when there wasn't any good music on, I'd 

              be dead now, or better off dead! He had Elaine Gottschall on his 

              program discussing her book, which I promptly bought. I had been 

              in the hospital for 11 days, with my doctors stopping by every day 

              for their usual visit, just to tell me that I had to face the fact 

              that I was a *very* sick cookie, and would be *very* sick for the 

              rest of my life. Of course they told me to eat starch and sugar, 

              which would have kept me sick, and going to them for the rest of 

              my life. I later heard my doctor was instrumental in banning any 

              mention of the SCD and Elaine Gottschall from the Crohn's and Colitis 

              Foundation.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

              <br>

              It really isn't as difficult s you think to stay on the diet, although 

              of course you are right that it does take a certain amount of discipline. 

              Sure, breads and other starches taste great, but after finding out 

              what it feels like to be on the diet, one realizes that it just 

              isn't *worth* it to eat that stuff. And you *can* go to restaurants 

              and other people's homes for dinner (as long as they are not serving 

              pasta for the main course!). There really is a wide variety of food 

              to eat, all of it very good for you (although more expensive than 

              starch). You can eat meat, fish, seafood, most cheeses, almost all 

              vegetables and fruits, several nuts, peanut butter, coffee, tea.... 

              And *wine* is allowed!<br>

              <br>

              Yes, I'm sometimes a pill in a restaurant, quizzing poor waiters/waitresses 

              about whether the fish has any starch coating (and having to send 

              it back if they made it with flour in spite of instructions), or 

              whether they use real butter (not a problem in better restaurants, 

              of course)... But it really is worth it. And the only things you 

              have to make from scratch are the breads, muffins and cakes, and 

              yogurt and cheesecake. You really don't have to spend your life 

              cooking. So I encourage you to give it a try; it really is worth 

              it.<br>

              <br>

              Hugs and best of luck,<br>

              <br>

              Today is one year to the day that I started the SCD Diet. Lets see: 

              a year ago I weighed 125lb, my waist was -27, my blood count was 

              5, I couldn't stop going to the bathroom (average 10 times a day), 

              I had no appetite, my fistula was inflamed and bleeding, and my 

              stomach was killing me. I was on medication; Prednisone, Ciprofloxacin, 

              Previcid, Flagyl, and Asacol.<br>

              <br>

              Today one year later! My weight today is 176lb, my waist is now 

              33+, my blood count is 12, I am going to the bathroom once maybe 

              twice a day, my appetite I just can't stop eating, my fistula it's 

              like as if it's not even there, and my stomach NO PAIN! I am also 

              not taking any medication only a couple of vitamins.<br>

              <br>

              THANK GOD!<br>

              <br>

              This diet was one of the best things that happened to me. I have 

              had Crohns for 71/2 years and not one day went by that I didn't 

              have pain in my gut. <br>

              <br>

              GOD BLESS EVERYONE! I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday and 

              a healthy and happy New Year!<br>

              <br>

              Hi! My name is Jim and I recently started the Specific Carbohydrate 

              Diet. I am also taking medication. I believe the diet is helping 

              me a great deal. I gain weight every day. However, my gastroenterologist 

              doesn't believe in the diet, he believes in medication and surgery. 

              My current doctor [Dr. Hoffman] wrote the forward to the Elaine 

              Gottschall book &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle.&quot; He said 

              I was one of the top worst patients he saw in 1996. <br>

              During the six months before the diet I experienced a lot of stress 

              and ate poorly. Since I started the diet (the day before Christmas 

              Eve) I have gained one pound a day! I am 5'11 and weighed 158 pounds 

              but after the flare up my weight dropped to 125. My doctor said 

              he cannot believe how quickly I am recovering. I am also very surprised 

              considering my health at the time. <br>

              He said he soon expects to see me drug free. He treats me holistically 

              while my gastroenterologist just gives me medication. I can't wait 

              to get off the medication, because I now believe you are what you 

              eat. I am very grateful to Elaine and my doctor (Dr. Hoffman). They 

              are heaven sent. So far 1997 is great!<br>

              Hi! I am very happy that the SCD group is up and running. This group 

              is the best thing going. I was in terrible shape 7 months ago. I 

              can't believe how great I feel from this diet. I thank GOD everyday 

              for Elaine and her book and Dr. Hoffman for introducing me to the 

              book. I have NO pain in the gut and I no longer need to run to the 

              bathroom 10 times a day. The bleeding stopped about 3 weeks into 

              the diet. My breath doesn't stink anymore and I also gained back 

              a lot of weight--34 pounds in total. Well it's time to go, I wish 

              the best to all. Keep the faith.<br>

              <br>

              Good Luck!<br>

              &gt;I don't mean to pry, but I'm curious as to how long you had 

              colitis and how severe it was when you started the diet. How long 

              have you been free of symptoms?<br>

              <br>

              Dear Steven, Pry away, Thanks to this great modern computer technology, 

              I can just cut &amp; paste my &quot;story&quot; &amp; send. I'm 

              more than happy to help. Passing on information about bowel disease 

              is my way of &quot;paying back&quot; my incredible good fortune. 

              I experienced several years of diarrhea before being diagnosed with 

              UC. Eventually my bowel movements became more and more laced with 

              blood until it seemed there was no stool, only mucus and blood (sorry 

              for being so graphic). The worst part was having to go to the bathroom 

              eight, ten, sometimes 20 times a day. A year before being diagnosed, 

              I went to see a gastroenterologist who couldn't find anything wrong 

              and said I should try to reduce the stress in my life. My diagnosis 

              of UC happened in a roundabout way. I'd been studying martial arts 

              for 13 years, and about 9 years ago, I broke my foot in 2 places. 

              The healing became prolonged and difficult. <br>

              <br>

              Finally, I went to see the orthopedist who gave me an anti-inflammatory. 

              The medication was mild because I told him I had stomach problems. 

              However, the next day my stool was black. I knew this indicated 

              internal bleeding (high in the GI tract), so I immediately stopped 

              taking the anti-inflammatory. When I went back to the doctor on 

              the following month, my foot was a little better. When he asked 

              if the meds helped, I told him what had happened. He said there 

              was probably no reason for concern. However, just to be safe, he 

              sent me to the emergency room for get a blood count. The blood count 

              was below 7, the normal being over 12. From there, I was placed 

              in the Intensive Care Unit. For ten days they conducted tests from 

              every orifice to find out where all the blood was being lost. I 

              didn't feel that sick but the doctors worried about my not making 

              it through the night. Finally they diagnosed me with ulcerative 

              colitis.<br>

              I was told that dietary changes would not help my condition and 

              medication could assist only sporadically. The only cure was removal 

              of the colon. They also told me that most people with this disease 

              lose their colon to cancer within 7 years of being diagnosed. For 

              the next five years, I suffered constant diarrhea sometimes mixed 

              with blood. <br>

              <br>

              About 2 years ago a patient where I work (I manage a dental office) 

              told me about hearing Elaine explain her diet on a talk show. I 

              listened politely but I KNEW that diets don't work for UC. However 

              this patient kept bugging me every time she came in. She always 

              wanted to know if I'd tried the diet yet. Finally I went out and 

              bought the book, but after reading it I thought the diet would kill 

              me. I hadn't attempted to digest fruits or vegetables for years 

              and yet this diet included many of them.<br>

              <br>

              My cousin called as I was finishing the book. I told her about it 

              and she mentioned a friend of hers with Crohn's who had major success 

              with what sounded like the same diet. I called this woman and was 

              floored by both the extent of her illness and her success with the 

              diet. After that conversation I decided to give the diet a shot. 

              It has worked miracles for me. I have a yearly colonoscopy and last 

              year my doctor couldn't believe my colon. He said it looked like 

              that of a healthy 18 year old. (I turned 50 this month.) Of course 

              you know about my test this week. So that's my story. Hope you have 

              a happy &amp; healthy New Year. If you have questions about the 

              diet itself, please let me know. Lots of luck!!<br>

              <br>

              My name is Jim Prousalis and I am 30 years old. I would like to 

              thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just visited my doctor 

              and he is amazed on how well I am doing. His name is Dr. Ronald 

              Hoffman, he wrote the forward to your book, he is a great doctor. 

              I will give you a brief history of my battle with Crohn's. I was 

              diagnosed about six years ago with this awful disease. I had stomach 

              pains everyday no matter what type of medication that I was taking. 

              </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I was 192 pounds 

              prior to the Crohn's disease. I lost around 45-50 pounds in about 

              a months time L. All the doctors that I was seeing told me that 

              I would have to be on medication for the rest of my life and down 

              the line I will have to do surgery. I was bouncing from doctor to 

              doctor and they all said basically the same thing. September of 

              1996 I took a turn for the worst, I lost even more weight (went 

              down to 125 pounds) and I was bleeding profusely. I was so weak 

              I couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom without getting out 

              of breath. Then my wife was looking for a doctor on the Internet 

              and she found Dr. Ronald Hoffman. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My first visit 

              with Dr. Ronald Hoffman was on 12/24/96. He gave me your book on 

              the first visit, I started the diet immediately. I noticed three 

              days after starting the diet that the pain in my gut stopped. Then 

              I noticed that I wasn't going to the bathroom 10 times a day. Then 

              about two weeks later I noticed that my stools were starting to 

              form. I now go to the bathroom maybe once a day and with formed 

              stools J. I am to this day following the diet faithfully. I thank 

              GOD for you Elaine Gottschall and also Dr. Ronald Hoffman for giving 

              me my life back. <br>

              </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I just want 

              you to know that I am 163 pounds as of yesterday. I am still gaining 

              weight, I just hope I will stop before I go the other way (just 

              kidding). I also have a friend who has Crohn's and he started the 

              diet eight days ago, he told me that he doesn't feel any pain in 

              his gut. He still has loose stools and goes to the bathroom four 

              time a day. I told him that the first sign for me was the pain went 

              away, so stick with it. <br>

              <br>

              Hello everybody.<br>

              <br>

              I have been a passive listener to the list for about a month now 

              and tried the diet for two weeks. I've finally managed to come up 

              with a question (I guess there will be more of them in the future), 

              but, for those of you who are interested, I thought I could tell 

              you something about myself and my disease. For those of you who 

              aren't interested, the <br>

              question is at the end.<br>

              <br>

              I'm 34 and was diagnosed with CD 13 years ago and been on prednisone 

              since that (I take other medications as well, but the long-term 

              use of prednisone is what bothers my doctor. She tries to convince 

              me of the benefits of surgery, but I can't say that I'm very interested). 

              Whenever I try to get below 10 mg, I get a relapse and must increase 

              the dosage again. For the last couple of years the increase has 

              grown, so, nowadays, I have to take 50 mg to get it under control 

              again. What I've experienced during this second week on the diet 

              sure as hell beats a 50 mg increase of prednisone. I can't say that 

              my stools are quite normal yet, but not far from it (it's been over 

              ten years since that happened the last time). The only pain I have 

              now is sometimes when it's time to visit the bathroom, but it's 

              FAR from the old chrons-pain, so I guess It's because my stomach 

              isn't used to this new sensation. Even my friends tell me that I 

              look much healthier now than I did two weeks ago. Another funny 

              thing is that I've been drinking a lot of Coca-cola (1.5 liters/day) 

              and been a heavy candy consumer, and I DON'T MISS THAT AT ALL! so 

              I guess I won't have any problems sticking to the diet.<br>

              <br>

              And here's my question: Do all unripe fruits contain starch, or 

              is it just the bananas? Elaine only mentions bananas in the book. 

              I'm asking this because I'm having some trouble determining if apples 

              are ripe or not. They taste OK, but I sometimes find them a bit 

              hard. It doesn't seem to bother my stomach, but I'm a bit worried 

              that it might slow down (or even stop) the progress I've seen so 

              far.<br>

              Hi Bernt,<br>

              <br>

              <br>

              I am in the same situation as you with only five years of prednisone 

              use (never more than 80mg). You should get a bone density x-ray 

              done now to determine how much bone loss you have. I was told when 

              I was 31 that I now have the bones of an 80-year-old (no joke). 

              So thanks to prednisone<br>

              and &quot;medical doctors&quot;, I now have severe osteoporosis 

              :(<br>

              <br>

              <font color="#999999">&gt; The only pain I have now is sometimes 

              when it's time to visit the bathroom, but it's FAR from the old 

              chrons-pain,</font><br>

              <br>

              The most severe pain I had was in my second year of diagnosis, the 

              kind that doubles you over and feels like a knife twisting in your 

              gut. I had surgery in the third year because of an ulcer perforation. 

              Since then the only pain (if any) is due to bloating or going to 

              the bathroom in the morning while things are trying to pass by the 

              inflammation areas. Afterwards, it is a relief.<br>

              <br>

              <font color="#999999">&gt; Another funny thing is that I've been 

              drinking a lot of Coca-cola (1.5 &gt; liters/day) and been a heavy 

              candy consumer, and I DON'T MISS THAT AT ALL! so I guess I won't 

              have any problems sticking to the diet.</font><br>

              <br>

              Well like most of us on this list (probably), there was some kind 

              of over-indulgence in some use of sugar. My downfall was growing 

              up with a jug of Kool-Aid each day (with 1 cup of sugar).<br>

              <br>

              <font color="#999999">&gt; And here's my question: Do all unripe 

              fruits contain starch, or is it &gt; just the bananas? Elaine only 

              mentions bananas in the book. I'm asking this because I'm having 

              some trouble determining if apples are ripe or not. They taste OK, 

              but I sometimes find them a bit hard.</font><br>

              <br>

              It seems to me quite clear in the book that Elaine states *anyone* 

              just starting the diet should only eat COOKED/BAKED fruit. Only 

              try one fruit or veggy at a time for a few days and notice any reaction. 

              Same goes for eggs, cheese, nut flour, etc.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hope my experiences

              Subject: <b>healthy colon</b><br>

              <br>

              It is great to see as many postings that have been showing up on 

              the SCD list the last few months. While I have not been active in 

              postings for some time, certainly the subjects appearing on the 

              list continue to hold my interest. However I must plead guilty of 

              receiving more benefits from this list than<br>

              having returned in the way of postings of encouragement to the new 

              comers who are desperately in need of help to expel their fears, 

              as well to offer assistance with this diet. If my memory serves 

              me correctly there are others like myself, after becoming stable 

              on the SCD diet find all too convenient to quietly slip away. So 

              then for those on the list, who have<br>

              nothing but fears and questions, may I relate this success story 

              for you of how the SCD turned my life around and made live worthwhile 

              again.<br>

              <br>

              Fifteen years ago I found myself bleeding from the rectum, so severely 

              I was forced to empty the colon approx. every twenty minutes. I 

              was of the opinion I suffered from bleeding internal hemorrhoids 

              in the lower colon. Our family doctor advised me to make an appointment 

              with a Doctor who specialized in problems of the bowel. After the 

              examination I was shocked<br>

              when the Doctor stated &quot;Good news - you do not have Cancer. 

              But you do have Ulcerative Colitis, and that may or may not contribute 

              to cancer of the bowel.&quot; Frightening words for a man who would 

              all but faint when a nurse drew blood from his arm. &quot;How shall 

              I cure this disease Doctor?&quot; &quot;There is no known cure.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I will venture 

              everyone on this list has a similar story. After finding this list 

              in its early days it was comforting to learn there was a place where 

              the problems of IBD could be discussed openly.<br>

              <br>

              I started the diet in mar. 1993, failed it after three weeks, then 

              tried the second time. By the end of the same year the colon was 

              well on its way to full recovery. I was symptom free with no flares 

              for well more than two years. I used medications for only the first 

              month during that period. I made the yogurt, stuck to the book, 

              although I never did do any baking, and<br>

              still dont. Chopped, fresh or frozen mixed veggies and fruit. I 

              can eat apples, oranges, bananas by the bushel. I started with small 

              amounts of fish, chicken, scrambled eggs, beef and very crisp bacon 

              later on in the diet I drank very weak coffee black. My colon appeared 

              to have recovered completely. I felt so improved, health wise after 

              two and some half years with no flares, that I decided I could now 

              go back to eating some starch on a limited basis. That was a serious 

              mistake. Within six to eight months I was bleeding from the colon, 

              with severe pains in both sides, to the extent I could not lie on 

              either side in bed at night. I lost all the weight I had gained 

              in the previous two years.<br>

              <br>

              In July of 1996 I was able to view my colon on closed circuit TV 

              while having a sigmoidoscopy. The inflammation was limited to approx. 

              half way around a cross section and 12 inches (30cm) long. This 

              damage resulted in approx. 6 to eight months from allowing limited 

              starch in my diet. I went back on Medication for two weeks until 

              the bleeding stopped, also started back full time on the diet. I 

              had one small flare for just a few days, then progressed steadily. 

              I had a colonoscopy one year later (one month ago) the results showed 

              no sign of any bowel disease, healthy and wide open. I was advised 

              to come back in two or three years, unless I have a flare. (He wasn't 

              the least interested in my starch free diet.) The last few months 

              I have gained my regular energy<br>

              back, and I don't know how or why. I can't think of any large changes 

              I may have made in my diet. I cut back or(I dont need) as much honey 

              now as used earlier. I will stay on the diet for the rest of my 

              days. The diet is now my life style. I wont return to the foods 

              that make me ill. There is no secret to this diet. It is after all 

              nothing but simply healthy food.<br>

              So why in the world would I to leave it? I hope this post will bring 

              some encouragement to those who struggle to free themselves from 

              the ravages of bowel disease.<br>

              <br>

              Good luck in your search for good health.<br>
