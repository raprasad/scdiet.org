                    welcome! I've been here only 2 weeks, but I had to chime in--</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You said:</font></p>

                      I crave carbohydrates. I LOVE carbohydrates. Since my IBS 
                      (or whatever it is) flared up very badly a few weeks ago, 
                      it seems like a baked potato or </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">couscous 
                      are the only things that sit well with me. So I'm a little 
                      incredulous that starch is the problem... Did any others 
                      on this list find carbohydrates soothing before going on 
                      the diet? Is this normal, or does it mean that this diet 
                      would be wrong for me? <br>
                      2) Similarly, protein has always felt hard on my stomach. 
                      I can't digest beef at all; I usually throw it back up. 
                      Is this common?</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm 
                      a little nervous because it seems like Ms. Gottschall is 
                      recommending<br>
                      the foods I've had the worst reactions to in the past. &lt;&lt;</font></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sarah, 
                    I got chills reading this, because it was like listening to 
                    my own EXACT thoughts and feelings. I have some small bowel 
                    inflammation, and my appetite is so poor and I get so full 
                    from tiny amounts that I've had to have intravenous feedings. 
                    The only thing that seemed to go down well was the wheat bread 
                    and crackers. Every meal, every snack, every nibble, all day 
                    long. I could almost cry if I was out somewhere without it. 
                    I needed the calories after all, I rationalized to myself, 
                    so how could I give that up? It was a very difficult process 
                    of living with this problem for so many years and finally 
                    coming to dead ends everywhere I turned, that I finally saw 
                    that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0969276818/goodbooks/">this</a> 
                    was the only thing left I hadn't tried.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had 
                    after all tested positive for one of the blood tests for celiac 
                    disease, for whatever that's worth, but the real value of 
                    it was that it got me more serious about the dead end I was 
                    in with my diet and coming to terms with how stuck I was. 
                    I knew that I had to go off the bread. So I filled up the 
                    void with all the gluten-free junk (expensive as heck), and 
                    that just made me more bloated and sore.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What all 
                    those foods did, is calmed my fear *in the short run*, the 
                    fear of not getting enough calories. I could nibble on a rice 
                    cracker and I could delude myself that I was doing the right 
                    thing, and get the addictive fix met. After all, with my eating 
                    problem, any medical person would have a fit if they knew 
                    I was restricting certain foods. I've always had to fight 
                    to get them to see that I'm not anorexic and don't try to 
                    lose weight. It was so hard to get myself out from under that 
                    mindset that I'd learned from them, and the fear of their 
                    disapproval. I need my doctor to order the I-V feedings, so 
                    I have to keep working with him.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I 
                    also KNEW, my bodily wisdom just knew, that my grain cravings 
                    were more than just the need for calories. Grains contain 
                    opiate-like substances that can cause actual physical addiction. 
                    No wonder the craving gets worse the more you eat them, and 
                    you think you love them. The by-products of the bugs in your 
                    gut that you are feeding, are making you almost drunk.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I 
                    used to work in an office, I used to eat a cup of Dannon yogurt 
                    with the sugary fruit, and a bunch of wheat crackers every 
                    day for lunch. Afterward, I was compelled to put my head down 
                    on my desk. I literally couldn't move. I stuck it out for 
                    another hour or so, and then had to go home. I cut my work 
                    day down, and then soon wasn't able to work at all.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wheat 
                    would always seem to fill a need at the moment, but isn't 
                    that what an addictive drug does.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I always 
                    had the experience that protein was too hard to digest. But 
                    what was trying to eat? Beans and grains. No wonder! When 
                    I went off my vegetarian diet and tried some fresh fish, I 
                    could not believe how light it was. I started slowly, just 
                    a few forkfuls of sole, and now I eat fresh salmon too, it's 
                    very tender. I like other fish too, but some are chewier and 
                    the very tender ones I find easier.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've started 
                    eating a little homemade yogurt (a far cry from the Dannon 
                    junk), and that worked okay too, about 1/4 cup to start, or 
                    even a few spoonfuls if you're hesitant. As much as it seems 
                    that I can't digest anything, even those proteins are okay. 
                    So I'm sure that protein isn't to blame; I bet it's just the 
                    particualr ones you've been using. Have you tried chicken 
                    soup? I started with broth, and then began eating small pieces 
                    of chicken in it. You can take it step by step.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've had 
                    some withdrawal symptoms from going off the grains, but that's 
                    making me even more sure that I have to tough it out and get 
                    over this hump. I just have to be patient with all the weird 
                    stuff that is coming up right now. Last night I was able to 
                    eat a little more salmon than usual, and some cooked veggies 
                    and an olive. I can feel that the bloating is way down, and 
                    although digestion isn't greatly improved yet, this is giving 
                    me the chance to work on the foods that I've really wanted 
                    to be eating anyway. And I've been able to eat some cooked 
                    fruit and ripe banana to provide some calories. Not enough 
                    yet, but I'm sure my digestive capacity will finally have 
                    a chance to increase now.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reason 
                    I was able to do this and my doubts cleared, was the support 
                    from <a href="../5community/SCDLI.html">this list</a> that 
                    showed me that I was not the strange case I thought I was. 
                    I consider myself an independent thinker and proactive with 
                    my health care, and yet I still have been under the cloud 
                    of my various doctors' misunderstanding of me for so many 
                    years. Suddenly, that cloud lifted here, and I realized that, 
                    like I was advised here, &quot;lousy guts are lousy guts&quot;, 
                    and you don't have to do too much more deliberating than that 
                    to know that SCD is a hopeful choice. I hope you'll try the 
                    diet. You can count on getting all the support you could possibly 
                    need.</font></p>
