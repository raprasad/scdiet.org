            <hr width="50%">
            From: Seth By searching the net for Wolfgang Lutz, I found scdiet.org 
            I was researching his work about Crohn's and Diet. 
            <hr width="50%">
            From: "rachel" Six years ago, through a patient in the office where 
            I work. She's heard about it on Dr. Hoffman's radio show, and told 
            me about it on three seperate occasions before I went out and bought 
            the book. Unconvinced and brainwashed to the contrary by medical establishment, 
            that something as simple as a diet could possibly work, it wasn't 
            til I spoke to someone who'd actually been on it and experienced it's 
            miracle firsthand, that I decided to give it a shot. Until the doctors 
            finally make a concession as simple, as basic, as incredibly logical, 
            as "there might be a link between IBD and diet", there will be a lot 
            of us chasing our tails and wasting precious time, our colons and 
            some even our lives, before finding this precious miracle. Sadly, 
            the woman who initially told me about the diet passed away last year, 
            and the woman who's restored health convinced me to try it, went off 
            the diet, is once again ill, and cannot/will not go back on it. Rachel 
            <hr width="50%">
            From: "Michael W" Mike: I heard about "Food and the Gut Reaction" 
            a number of times, starting about five years ago - including from 
            a couple at prenatal classes who were having excellent success with 
            it, but never paid much heed until - when I was desperately ill, my 
            wife saw Elaine on Dini Petty and insisted I try it. The rest is history. 
            <p>I wish we could produce a half hour infomercial with Elaine - she 
              was a powerful spokesperson when I saw her on Dini. Heck, she convinced 
              even me! 
            <p>Michael W
            <hr width="50%">
            From: "Katie" I heard about it from someone on the Canadian Crohn's 
            chat site. I actually responded about another post and he mentioned 
            the book in passing as something I might want to read (he found the 
            diet too restrictive for himself). I waited a few months to start 
            it like a dummy. I had to be really, really sick to give up my carbohydrates!

            From: Kirsi: I found it from Crohn's net,,,there was one testimony 
            about SCD, if I remember correctly.

            From: "brianm" Mike: Alt.Support.Crohns-Colitis and I too waited quite 
            a few months before giving it a try. SCD is not easy, it is not a 
            pill, but I sure feel a whole lot better. Gee, is this a 'Cult'? heh

            From: "Elaine" From Elaine In the l960's or early 70's I was in my 
            bedroom crying because Judy was to have her colon removed at eight 
            years of age. My friend, Martha, called my husband to see if she could 
            come over and comfort me. She lived 15 minutes away in Nutley, NJ 
            (original home of Martha Stewart). and on her way over she bumped 
            into HER friend in the supermarket and told her about my desperate 
            state and Judy (the second friend's child was in Judy's class). The 
            friend, Edith Dearling (her husband was the local pharmacist), told 
            Martha to tell me to call her and she would give me the name of the 
            doctor in NYC who saved her twins' lives at birth (born with, at that 
            time, too often fatalceliac disease). Herb said "no more colonoscopes, 
            if the child is going to die, let her die in peace." I begged and 
            the rest is history. Love 
            <hr width="50%">
            From: &quot;Claire&quot; I heard about it from someone on another 
            unrelated list, maybe a year or more ago. She had Celiac's and told 
            me about it when she heard I had Crohn's. But I was not ready to hear 
            it, and I knew nothing about Celiac's, didn't think they were related. 
            I was ignorant. Then, last spring when I got sicker, my boyfriend's 
            sister told me she heard about a Gottschall diet on Dr. Ronald Hoffman's 
            radio show in NY. That name rang a bell, so I then looked on amazon.com 
            and found the book, testimonials, this list, etc. 
            <hr width="50%">
            From: "Martha" I learned of the SCD from an e-mail friend on an allergy 
            list who's dealing with one of the same intestinal bacteria I am. 
            Actually I remember seeing some information about the diet on the 
            net a couple of years earlier, but can't remember now how I ran across 
            it. I obviously didn't pay much attention to it at the time. I read 
            that it was for Crohn's disease and since I didn't have Crohn's (or 
            an official UC diagnosis) I didn't think it would be helpful for me. 
            <hr width="50%">
            From: "Sarah K" I found out about the scd by searching on the internet 
            for info on ulcerative colitis and diet. I came upon The Healing Crow 
            website, and from there found out about Elaine's book. I immediately 
            checked the book out from the library! Thank goodness for her book 
            and Seth's site. Sarah Kiser, UC since 1997, scd since Oct 2000, INDIANA

            From: "Cheryl W" I found SCDiet.org through the use of a search engine 
            after my husband had a flare and was about to turn 40 and I was depressed 
            about what the future held for his health! It was the testimonials 
            regarding improved intestinal health as corroborated by colonoscopies 
            on the site that convinced my husband to give the diet a try. It has 
            worked for him even though he is not "fanatical", and his annual colonoscopy 
            after being on the diet for 9 months did show remarkable improvement.

            From: &quot;Joanne&quot; I read about BTVC on Dr. Hoffman's website 
            after doing a search on IBD and reading all the negative stuff about 
            children with IBD... He briefly mentioned the book and then we ordered 
            it from barnes & noble. We were so happy to read that there might 
            be something we could do to help and possibly prevent some of the 
            meds... Read it and didn't think I could EVER do it! But here it is

            From: "james & charlene" I learned about the SCD two years ago from 
            a friend who gave me Food and the Gut Reaction. I wasn't sick enough 
            to stick to it and then when I hit rock bottom in October my Naturopath 
            lent me BTVC. I went and bought my own shortly after and then looked

            From: "Leslie G" Hello: I heard about SCD by researching on the Internet. 
            My Doc for 1 1/2 yrs stated "There may be a connection between colitis 
            and diet but no studies have been done. You can keep a food journal 
            if you want but you must take all meds until you are in complete remission." 
            She is on maternity leave now and is not aware that I am on SCD. I 
            spoke to her collegue's nurse who told me that there probably IS a 
            relationship between diet and colitis and that if I had changed my 
            diet and I have seen improvement then I should stay on it! Duh! Once 
            I read about SCD I immediately ordered BTVC and here I am. 
            <p>Also, I got ambitious and made DCCC by the buttermilk/oven method 
              directions that were on this list serve a while ago. Now I have 
              more than I immediately need, can I freeze some? Will it be okay 
              when I thaw it in a few weeks?

            From: &quot;Paula&quot; I learned about the scd ( for my 9 yr. old 
            daughter )after seeing Dr. Galland in NYC. After purchasing the book 
            in his office and reading it I didn't think that it would neccessarily 
            help her since she was a vegetarian and so I dismissesd trying the 
            diet for a whole two years ! But then one day I picked it up again 
            and reread it and said that WE MUST TRY IT , what do we have to loose 
            ! And Thank G-D - it has helped her - dispite her still remaining 
            a vegetarian . I would love for her to eat some fish but she is adamently 
            aposed to same . She has had little flares here and there - but on 
            a whole the scd has greatly helped her to stay as healthy as possible. 
            She is not on any medication - I have always given her vitamins - 
            various ones here and there and currently I have her taking colostrum 
            twice a day ( for about a month now ) She offers no complaints - has 
            alot of energy - & does well in school . She does however remain slim 
            - something that she was never prior to this condition. 
            <p>Dispite eating alot , she just doesn't get heavier. I know in my 
              heart that she is still in a compromised absorption state - but 
              we keep trying to heal her gut completely. 
            <p>For certain , the scd has helped her - & THANK YOU SO MUCH ELAINE 
              for all your sharing - with all that you know. You are truly an 
              angel , & May G-d bless You Always !

            From: &quot;Rob L&quot; I discovered it through an Internet search 
            engine. I just couldn't accept my DR's opinion that even though he 
            couldn't tell me why this was happening to me he was sure I would 
            probably have to stay on drugs the rest of my life. While looking 
            for alternative treatment I somehow ended up on the Healing Crow where 
            I discovered Elaine's book and this group. 
            <p>I feel this group is as indispensable as Elaine's book for helping 
              me to fight this disease. Without the great advice and encouragement 
              from all of you I would never have had the confidence and discipline 
              to stick with the diet long enough to see the results I am currently 
              enjoying. I am still not 100% but I am feeling so much better both 
              physically and mentally and am enjoying life again. 
            <p>Thank you so much to Elaine and the whole group.

            From: &quot;christopher s&quot; I found some anecdotal references 
            to it on the usenet (alt.support-crohns-colitis I think) as well as 
            on somebody's personal IBD site, but the reviews were very mixed as 
            is usual in such settings (where many people will chime in who didn't 
            really try the diet at all or at least, never truly tried it or understood 
            it), so as a rsult I didn't think much of it. I was heavily into traditional 
            chinese medicine at the time. When I started to flare worse and worse 
            after a year of TCM (after some improvement over the first 8 mos.) 
            I started searching the internet and by chance came across a reference 
            to www.scdiet.org on the usenet again. It took me about three months 
            of reading up, lurking, ordering and reading BTVC early in 2000 before 
            I decided to jump in.

            From: &quot;christopher s&quot; I am not surprised, but still saddened, 
            to notice the *sickening* fact that not one person yet on this thread 
            has said that their GI put them onto the SCD. Not one. And to think 
            those guys (and gals) are supposed to 'first do not harm.' Very sad.

            From: "Steve D" Christopher, I guess you missed my previous message. 
            My GI is the one who first told me about SCD about 13 months ago. 
            He said he had heard people were having success with the diet and 
            told me the name of the book. I ordered it that night from Amazon 
            and started trying to follow the diet as soon as I got the book. He 
            has been supportive and helpful. When I questioned what was in the 
            16 Pentasa I took every day, he looked it up and found starch listed. 
            He agreed with my decision to stop taking it. He also worked with 
            me to get off prednisone that I had started using for the last year 
            or two. The last time I saw him was in July for my 2 year colonoscopy, 
            which he said looked pretty good overall.

            From: "Brenda" I also learned about SCD through the Dini Petty show, 
            I saw Elaine talking about this special diet for Crohn's and colitis. 
            But I waited and I don't know why. Then I saw her on a local station 
            in the Canadian city where I live, when I was channel surfing. She 
            said she was going to be at a certain book store that afternoon so

            From: &quot;Roseann&quot; I had just been diagnosed with Crohn's when 
            I first came across a copy of BVTC in a health/new age store in Harvard 
            Square. I bought the book, but when I read it I didn't think I could 
            do the diet because I was on pretty much a liquid diet and I was afraid 
            to eat. A year later, after a resection, I decided I wasn't going 
            to let the Crohn's come back and started the SCD. I had been feeling 
            some of the old symptoms return, mildly. It took a few tries before 
            I could stick to the diet but the longer I've "fanatically adhered 
            to the diet" the easier it's become. Plus, I'm actually learning to

            Martin and the SCD was mentioned in it under Crohns disease as a good 
            diet to follow. This was a year after I had been diagnosed. I had 
            already lost weight and was feeling tired, ill and withdrawn. I was 
            lucky because the SCD diet kicked in right away. It has been such

            From: &quot;Kevin Q&quot; We received a copy of BTVC from a co-worker 
            of mine. I never knew she had Crohn's. She was horrified by the degree 
            of testing our son (then 1 year old) was undergoing to diagnose the 
            blood that was becoming more frequent. We had been told after his 
            first colonoscopy that it was NOT Crohn's or UC so we didn't read 
            the book. After Declan started deteriorating in health, growth, energy..., 
            we pulled out the book again to get ideas for foods that would be 
            absorbed more easily. At that time, he underwent a second colonoscopy 
            at New England Medical Center and they couldn't proceed due to the 
            fragile state of his body. They wanted to admit him for I've steroids. 
            He was 2 years and 20 days old. This was a nightmare because other 
            doctors and tests had ruled out ID. We started the diet that day. 
            With the exception of his recent flare, Declan has been healthier 
            in the last 3 months than since the first symptoms started at 21 days 
            old. Our new pediatric I has bought the book and has his staff reading 
            it. He is supporting us and seems pleased by all the lab work done 
            after 2 months symptom and drug-free. He said if this works, he wants 
            me to give the "alternative treatments" lecture to his 3rd year medical 
            students. We already had success with "good food treatments" with 
            our 5 year old daughter. She had 5 months of colic, chronic ear infections, 
            eczema, and was anaphylactic to peanuts. We started a modified diet 
            at 1 year old, and at age four she could eat everything (even peanuts). 
            She never had another ear infection and was spared the preventive 
            antibiotics and ear tubes her doctors had expected. Interestingly, 
            her food sensitivities were very similar to Declan's (dairy, soy, 
            wheat, yeast, chocolate, and potatoes). That's our story. I'm confident 
            it will have a happy ending. THANKS for all the support during Declan's 
            recent crisis. He is back in his Superman p.j., "flying" through the 
            house. I think the culprits were the augmentin and strawberry seeds. 
            The advice/information/encouragement from all the SCDers is invaluable!

            From: "Martha J" Our family naturopathic doctor told us about Food 
            and the Gut reaction in the early 1990's; my husband was discouraged 
            after trying several other alternative type treatments and just didn't 
            want to give up his "favorite foods." Our doctor told him that if 
            he wouldn't do the diet, at least eliminate (regular) dairy, wheat 
            and reduce sugar. He tried, and felt better. When one of our sons 
            was diagnosed with crohn's in Dec. 1999, I started the whole family 
            on the SCD immediately. While I couldn't control a 40 year old with 
            a sweet tooth, I could manage a nearly nine year old, since I prepared 
            all his food anyway. Our soon to be 10 year old has been symptom free 
            for nearly a year. His advice to all you newbies is as follows: "after 
            awhile, you won't miss any of that junk at all." My next goal is to 
            get him more involved in food preparation so that he can take care 
            of himself for the rest of his life. My husband is impressed and trying 
            hard, even when faced with business travel and "bad influences" at 
            the office. A year ago, I had to remind myself to breathe, I was so 
            upset. Now I know that two crohnsies in one family means that we weren't 
            meant to eat what we were eating before; thanks to Elaine for saving 
            our lives and chasing away the incredible heartache from our family. 
            <p>Very interesting news to share: I had blood tests done on my son 
              and myself recently to see how this diet has affected my son with 
              crohns and me, without IBD, one year later: absolutely sterling 
              results!!! Perfect in every way. I'm 41 and had a bit of a thyroid 
              problem since I was 37 and it is SO Gone. My cholesterol, which 
              was too low, is just as the doc wants it. I can hardly wait to show 
              the gastro doc my son's results....then again, yes, I can wait. 
              Keep on cooking, folks! Love, Mart

            From: &quot;Susan S&quot; Hi Mike, I learned about SCD on the St. 
            Johns Celiac Listserve. Every now and then, someone would mention 
            BTVC and other group members would jump all over them for it. The 
            consensus on that list at that time was that Elaine's book was a bunch 
            of hogwash. Those few positive messages snuck in made me curious, 
            so I got the book out of the library. My initial reaction was that 
            SCD would be too difficult to follow. But after several months of 
            increasingly getting sick from the celiac diet, I bought the book 
            and started SCD in earnest. It was the best thing I ever did. 
            <p>I think the reason the St. Johns list was so hostile to BTVC is 
              that so many of the regulars are involved in selling alternative 
              grain flour products to others on the list. They sure made money 
              off of me when I was active on it.

            From: &quot;Ruth&quot; I heard about the diet from a friend who had 
            also used. In all my research about IBS on the internet i never found 
            any reference to it so i never knew to look until someone told me 
            about it. *~ruth~*

            From: "Alpaslan" Dear Elaine, 
            <p>It was in San Francisco. Her office looked like a doctor's office, 
              quite professional. It is in the lobby of a medical building, close 
              to a major hospital where many doctors have their practice. I would 
              not be surprised if she is an ADA dietitian. I could check and let 
              you know at the first opportunity. 
            <p>She offered regular weekly visits until I learned the diet. Not 
              having followed any diets and trusting my own self discipline, I 
              figured I could follow any diet without help from her, and asked 
              her about literature. 
            <p>She said, "Basically there are two books. Normally I could sell 
              you both of them, but currently I am out of the one." I suspected 
              that that was the better book. It was the BTVC. I found it at a 
              bookstore in Berkeley. Then I searched the www and found Mik's site 
              and Rachel's wonderful list. The rest is history. 
            <p>Of course in retrospect I know that I would have needed help from 
              the dietitian if I hadn't found the Long Island List. It has been 
              a total learning experience as many on this list already know. 
            <p>About three months ago following your advice (and encouragement 
              from our dear Rachel) I asked my GI and switched to Azulfadine. 
              Yes, it is more effective than Pentasa, and so far no side effects. 
              With all the help available on this list, a little luck and a lot 
              of persistence I am hopeful one day I will be symptom free. In the 
              meantime there is steady improvement and nothing beats living with 
              hope. 
            <p>With a lot of love and eternal feelings of gratitude and devotion.

            From: "Keith" I found out about this a few weeks or so ago. I get 
            the newsgroup alt.support.crohns-colitis and several had posted there 
            about the SCD diet and I finally went to the website and read more 
            about this and the more I read the more I wanted to know. So as of 
            last saturday I ordered the book and I eagerly await to get the book 
            and start to diet to getting my health and life back after 14 years 
            of several doctors and no hope from them and many of them wanting 
            to do surgery and remove my colon because of UC. Well I never let 
            them cause I was too fond of my colon and I'm glad I did cause from 
            reading from all of these testimonials I know that I will get well 
            and that I will get healthy and I plan on getting in shape and hopefully 
            I will get to accomplish a dream of mine and that is to play hockey. 
            I may be 34 but I have a passion to do this. I know it won't be easy 
            to do this diet at first because I will have to give up alot of stuff 
            that I like to eat and drink (especially Dr Pepper - I love it) but 
            my health is more important. Thanks to you Elaine, even tho I haven't 
            started the diet I know that it is because of this book that you have 
            helped many people and you are more valueable to us than any prize 
            that could be awarded to you.

            From: &quot;Ed/Roz W&quot; Hi everyone, I learned about the SCD by 
            an act of G-d like some other people on this list. I was visiting 
            my mother when she had had a heart attack even though she said she 
            was fine and she was already home and she said not to come. My friend 
            gets a monthly nutritional newletter by Dr Wright and Dr Gaby and 
            the one she got the day I arrived was on Crohn's disease so she brought 
            it over to show me. The main article in it was about the SCD and a 
            story of a patient of theirs who had been doing so well on the diet 
            and then he stopped the diet and got sick again. It gave a little 
            summary of which foods were allowed and which were not. I just knew 
            that it would help me as at the time I was on the Yeast Connection 
            diet and some things that they said to eliminate (like soy products) 
            bothered me but I was having difficulty telling which things bothered 
            me. I bought the book the next day and started the diet at once and 
            never looked back. It took me a long time to find the web page and 
            email list as my copy of BTVC didn't have it listed in it. I also 
            didn't know that there was a web page or an email list for the diet. 
            I found that the list helped me immensely as I thought I was doing 
            the diet 100% but I found that I was making some mistakes with vitamins 
            and things like that and I also found that I had to fine tune the 
            diet and the wonderful people on this list really helped me get it 
            together. In Feb. I will be on the diet 3 years, I can't believe it. 
            Elaine, since you have been on the list I have learned so much and 
            I appreciate how hard you have struggled to get your message across. 
            I hope your reward is knowing how many people you have helped. Thank

            whose name I also forget, wrote to me off-list five years ago to recommend 
            the diet, and I will be ever grateful to him and to Elaine.

              need for double blind trials. I have decided not to answer him this 
              time. What I do is to write off-list to those persons on the IBD

            from Amazon that day. Have been on the diet since 7/30/00 (with some 
            cheating during a trip to Paris and London in December). The good 
            thing motivationally for me was that my intestines immediately told

            keywords and found an article by Dr. R. Hoffman on CD & UC. This article 
            has a Reference of BTVC. That was the night I can never forget when 
            our son told us on the phone after his first visit to his GI that 
            he has either Crohn's Disease or Colitis and that more tests were 
            scheduled. I spent that night on the Internet learning and reading 
            the horrible things which could happened with these diseases and the 
            side effects of medications. I was reading, crying and praying and 
            cleaning my eyes to be able to read. Next day I was in the library 
            reading the first chaper of BTVC; everything was making so much sense.

            From: "Darlene W&quot; Hello everyone. I found out about SCD while 
            visiting the IBD Sucks website. They had a folder with messages 
            concerning the diet. I got the name of the book and looked it up on 
            Amazon.com and went on the diet as soon as it arrived. Unfortunately, 
            I went off over the Christmas holidays and wrote to the list about 
            whether I needed to be on the diet at all. I very foolhardily thought 
            that since I was off for three weeks with no ill side effects I would 
            campaign for Elaines blessing to remain off. I am starting to notice 
            some small problems and will return to the diet as soon as I can get 
            to the grocery store. The main problem I have noticed is that my mental 
            acuity is slipping. I cannot remember things from one moment to the 
            next. I will leave my office to get a file and have to come back and 
            look the name up again. I am on 16 Pentasa a day and I seem to remember 
            someone on this list saying that Pentasa causes some memory problem 
            and brain fog. Do you think it could be going off the diet that 
            is causing this? I have been on this dosage since a flair last June 
            without major memory problems. I am definitely going back on so that 
            I can reduce the Pentasa if not come off it all together. 
            <p>I also want to join everyone else in thanking Elaine for her stamina 
              and fortitude in trying to help people with all the roadblocks thrown 
              in her way. I know when I mentioned the diet to my GI he sort of 
              blew me off saying I like the yogurt idea and the rest couldnt 
              hurt. Of course, this is the same man who told me it was okay to 
              try the Atkins diet as long as I ate a bowl of All Bran everyday! 
              I didnt have the book with me but I return to see him in March 
              and I will take it with me then. Anyway, any ideas as to why I am 
              fuzzy and what to do about it would be greatly appreciated. My 
              coworkers are having a field day with my memory. Thanks.

            From: &quot;Colleen M&quot; Dear Mike, Wish I had a great and dramatic 
            story like Lisa's, but I don't. I just got onto Yahoo! and typed in 
            "Crohn's" one day, just like I'd done countless times before, just 
            to see what was new, and somehow ran across your web site. I don't 
            know why I had never come across it before. I ordered the book that 
            day and have never looked back. In retrospect, I'm sure I had seen 
            the cover of BTVC, but of course there are zillions of books out there 
            about intestinal problems and I'm sure I passed it off as just one 
            more useless theory without ever really looking at it. I was convinced 
            I had tried everything. I have a book called "Eating Right for a Bad 
            Gut," which you would think would pretty much nail it right on the 
            head, but of course it was no help at all and didn't say anything 
            new. I thought I had the healthiest diet in the world so it never, 
            ever occurred to me that my so-called healthy grain-and-soy diet was 
            *exactly* the problem. Elaine's book read like the story of my life 
            and I knew immediately that I had found the answer. I will always 
            be grateful.

              from the book. I added capers as the final ingredient and found 
              it gave the mayo a nicer taste. I use it as a dip for shrimp, over 
              eggs, or with a little yogurt as a salad dressing. (Capers are buds 
              from a particular shrub. The jar's label lists waater, salt, vinegar, 
              and capers. This should be legal, or???) Question: I made yogurt

              convinced until he told me that SHE had found out about it through 
              the Dini Petty show. I asked, and he gave me the phone number of 
              the person's mother. I called her long distance, and indeed, she 
              had seen Elaine on the talk show, and called Elaine and was persuaded 
              to try the diet. Today her son is alive and well. And so is my husband!

            <p>...Well, considering that the name Gottschall is derived from the 
              German for "Servant of G-d" or "G-d's echo"... 
            <p>;-) 
            <p>I don't remember seeing the original post on this so I don't know 
              exactly what was discussed. However, this is how I am dealing with 
              my GI. After a colonoscopy 2 months ago, my GI scolded me for not 
              being on maintenance meds, employing the usual scare tactics about 
              the risk of cancer, etc (which worked to some degree). He wrote 
              a prescription and I indicated I would go ahead and take them. I 
              was still in a daze from the anesthesia from the procedure and still 
              was not aware of SCD and the alternative that existed for me. 
            <p>I found SCD a couple of days after the colonoscopy and began it 
              as soon as I could locate BTVC. My GI had recommended a follow up 
              sigmoidoscopy in 2 months and wanted me to get weekly blood tests 
              to monitor the effect of the Asacol he prescribed (another reason 
              I am loathe to take meds). 
            <p>I wanted to try SCD before going on meds again. Not only am I not 
              crazy about taking meds but I wanted to know for sure whether it 
              was the diet that was working or the meds. 
            <p>I decided to write to my GI so that he would understand (hopefully) 
              exactly where I was coming from, and so that he could not derail 
              the discussion about diet. In the letter, I reminded him of the 
              last visit and his recommendations re: meds. I told him about the 
              SCD and enclosed a three page synopsis of the science behind the 
              diet I found on scd.org. I gave him the website address and told 
              him I would be more than happy to send him a copy of BTVC. 
            <p>I said, "I know it is your opinion that diet has nothing to do 
              with this ulcerative colitis. While I have the utmost respect for 
              your professionsal opinion, I hope you will understand that this 
              is something I must find out for myself before resigning myself 
              to a lifetime of medication." I told him that I hoped he would continue 
              to follow me for routine colonoscopies/sigmoidoscopies despite my 
              decision not to take medication at that time. 
            <p>I think that in writing, I was able to fully explain my point of 
              view without having him belittle the role of diet before I was able 
              to fully explain the rationale. At the same time, I hope I was able 
              to assure him that I still valued his opinion (except as it relates 
              to diet and UC, of course!) so that our doctor/patient relationship 
              is maintained. 
            <p>He has not responded, and I did not expect him to. I do not expect 
              him to approve of my decision to treat myself through diet and nutrition 
              instead of medication, but I do not need his approval. I get my 
              support here, from all of you and the glowing testimonials that 
              appear on this list daily. What I do need from him is his ability 
              to perform diagnostic exams to monitor my condition from time to 
              time. 
            <p>Sorry for being so long winded and I hope this is responsive to 
              the original post. 
            <p>Best, Deborah C.

            From: &quot;Judy G&quot; I wandered into a health store on Yonge near 
            College in Toronto not long after my diagnosis for CD (1996). I flipped 
            through BTVC and decided that omitting breads etc would be too difficult. 
            A few weeks later, I thought about it again and decided to buy the 
            book. My husband was so supportive in my efforts and that helped me 
            tremendously as I began my experiment with the diet. I had no symptoms 
            at the time (except for pred symptoms), and have had no episodes since 
            either, and have been off drugs for over 4 years. 
            <p>I was delighted to find the SCD on the internet several years ago 
              and keep tuned in for continuing motivation. I am doing really really 
              well and never want to forget why. 
            <p>Thanks Elaine.

            From: &quot;jeffrey B&quot;
<p>I first heard of the diet when I was in San Diego in '98. The diet, 
              book and author were mentioned by the host of a weekly radio health-talk 
              show called "The Nature of Health", hosted by Don Bodenbach. 
            <p>I had become quite unwell by the end of '97 and was in a crisis, 
              desperately searching for solutions. I had had another major health 
              crisis in my life in 1975 at age 24 and I had never really felt 
              well for most of my life but I still had no diagnosis. NO doctor 
              had ever been able to help me, only hurt me, so I was instinctively 
              staying away from doctors. 
            <p>So when I glanced at BTVC at a local heathfood supermarket, I ignorantly 
              dismissed it as too extreme for me to follow (At this point I still 
              had no idea that an intestinal disease was the root cause of all 
              my symptoms) 
            <p>About a year later I diagnosed myself as Celiac and went on a gluten 
              free diet. I was living in Sacramento then and also heard Dr Hoffman 
              mention the diet and the scdiet.com website on his radio show. I 
              soon started adjusting my diet to be more in line with the sc diet.I 
              finally went on the diet,following the book, in July of 2000 and 
              everyday I am grateful for Elaine's work and continuing participation 
              and for this great list and I try to spread the word when I get 
              the chance.
