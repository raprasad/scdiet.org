              Date: Thu, 25 Jan 2001 </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hello, My name 
              is Melanie. I've had Chrons [Crohn's] for 2 1/2 years. When I heard 
              about the diet I checked out the website and was very excited. I 
              bought the book and talked to my G.I. He said that he had others 
              try the diet and was very happy that I wanted. He said that it would 
              help. I went on the diet for about 2 weeks and had mass amount of 
              improvement, but Thanksgiving and Christmas came around. Now I just 
              can't seem to stay on the diet even though I know it helps. I love 
              food and I just don't want to miss it. I also have a small son and 
              a husband. I feel left out when they get to eat something and I 
              don't. I don't know what to do. I just bought <a href="http://www.scdkitchen.com">Lucy's 
              cookbook</a> hoping that if I have more recipes that I will stick 
              to the diet. I'm trying so hard. My Chrons has been so bad that 
              I have had 5 surgies in the last 2 years. I'm looking at a 6th. 
              I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I know I should just buck up 
              and do the diet, but that is easier said that done. Thank you for 
              any advice. <br>

              </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">Melanie, 
              Congratulations on finding and trying the diet. That is a major 
              feat in itself! Now if we could only get you over the craving hurdle. 
              Everyone has there own ways of staying on the diet, but here are 
              mine: When I started the diet 2 1/2 years ago, I had two major motivating 
              factors at the time. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">1) 
              My Crohn's Disease wasn't responding very well to my current medications. 
              I knew that if I continued down the path I was on that I would need 
              surgery at some point. Also, I suffered from terrible peri-anal 
              fistulas that weren't getting any better. If my fistulas got worse, 
              I was facing the fact that I might have to lose my entire colon 
              etc from them. So before I even found the SCD, I made a pact that 
              with myself that my health would be my number one priority and that 
              I would do anything to help improve it. I would no longer worry 
              about being ashamed or embarrassed of my condition ( I was very 
              ashamed at having CD at the time and thought I was defective, etc....). 
              Two weeks into the diet I felt amazing and I knew the diet would 
              work its wonders for me. Within a month I was off of all meds. Staring 
              in the face of certain surgery and the health pact I made with myself 
              gave me the motivation to continue on the Diet. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">2) 
              I fought off my cravings with knowledge. This may seem corny, but 
              I researched and read as much information that i possibly could 
              find on the Standard American Diet (SAD). I have learned so much 
              about nutrition and our current foods in the US, that I cringe everytime 
              I see someone "enjoying" a piece of cake etc. I am no longer tempted 
              at all. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">Books 
              that really helped me learn more about the ill effects of the SAD 
              were: NeanderThin by Ray Audette <br>
              Protein Power Lifestyle Plan by the Eades <br>
              Life without Bread by Wolfgang Lutz <br>
              The Sugar Blues by William Duffy <br>
              Fat of the Land by Viljamur Stefansson (the artic explorer - you 
              will have to get this one through the library, it is old). <br>
              The Stone Age Diet by Walter Voegtlin (another old book - Dr. Voegtlin 
              was a GI that prescribed an all meat diet for IBD). </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">I 
              also have some articles documenting the slow deterioration of the 
              Eskimo as these tribes introduced "modern" foods into their diet. 
              In less than twenty years, the Eskimo went from one of the healthiest 
              people on this earth to the worst. They now have one of the highest 
              incidences of disease - it is amazing stuff that isn't publicized 
              very much. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">So 
              if you think knowledge will help combat your cravings, as it did 
              for me, I recommend any/all of these books which you should be able 
              to get for free from your local library......And there's no reason 
              to feel deprived on this diet. There is so much good food. Just 
              make SCD legal food for the whole family, and if your husband wants 
              something else, make him fend for himself ;) </font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">This 
              diet isn't just healthy for those of us with IBD - it is healthy 
              for anyone...... <br>
              Good Luck, Seth </font></font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanie, I think 
              we all wish there was an easier way and I am sure there are many 
              SCDer's who share your same fears, myself included. This list has 
              been an incredible source of help, I can always log on with relative 
              assurance that I will have SCD mail, this is one of the things that 
              keeps me going on the bad days when it would just be easier to have 
              a piece of chocolate cake. The reality for me has come over time, 
              it feels so good to feel good. I don't want my intestines to run 
              my life and that was what was happening before I found the SCD. 
              They controlled where I worked, where I took vacations and pretty 
              much my day to day life. After three months on the diet I no longer 
              have the cravings, it's not easy and I still have some healing to 
              do but the future once again looks bright. There are a lot of wonderful 
              people here willing to offer help and support. Good luck. Josh UC

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanie: We 
              are all individuals - motivated by different things and with our 
              own individual strengths and weaknesses but, frankly, the thought 
              of exposing myself and my poor tortured intestines to the open air 
              and general anaesthetic (and the significant death rates from that 
              alone), staph infections (common at hospitals), a life of wearing 
              a colostomy bag and finally, (but not least) having a BIG, uncontrolled 
              D event in a manager's meeting - all keep me on the straight and 
              narrow. I don't know what motivates you, but if you know about the 
              diet and are facing another surgery, it might just be time to sit 
              down and have a LONG talk with yourself. The diet is not difficult 
              once you get into the swing of it, the food is diverse and flavorful 
              and the results are spectacular. There are really no negative trade-offs. 
              I wonder what other motivation you could possibly need. I hope, 
              for your sake, you find out and then get with the program and stick 
              to it. The other options are not acceptable. <br>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanie, I have 
              to agree with Seth. In fact his story is almost identical to mine 
              except he has been on the diet a lot longer. I had horrible per-anal 
              fistulas that were not going away and was extremely sick and facing 
              losing my colon. Feeling unable to take care of my children and 
              the fear of losing my colon were great motivating factors. I felt 
              better almost immediately upon starting the diet, that in itself 
              was very motivating. I suddenly realized playing with my children 
              wasn't like a huge task that I just did with no enjoyment because 
              I was so miserably sick I started enjoying life again. I never want 
              to go back to the way I was. I have only been on the diet 3 and 
              1/2 months and I can honestly say I don't even feel tempted anymore. 
              I think just recently I began to feel that way. I was the biggest 
              carbohydrate fiend that there was. I didn't think I could live without 
              pizza, the real stuff, or a lot of other foods. I never cared much 
              for meat, or vegtables or salads. I have found that over these few 
              months my tastes have changed. I enjoy things that I never had particularly 
              enjoyed before. Fruit tastes better, vegtables taste better. I have 
              found that cheddar cheese on anything (just about) makes it taste 
              better, vegtables, chicken soup etc. I also make sure that I am 
              never hungry when other people are having pizza or cake and it doesn't 
              bother me. When I am hungry I feel the most resentful that I have 
              to be on this diet. There are plenty of good things to eat on this 
              diet and I enjoy them more and more as time goes on. Your taste 
              really does change. I hated the yogurt at first but now it is my 
              favorite treat. I just love it mixed with bananas. I eat a lot of 
              that. I like cashew butter right out of the jar. It tastes like 
              peanut butter fudge to me. I love all the nut recipes but at present 
              I find I do much better without them. They irritate my system too 
              much. Lucy's cookbook is great. There are so many good recipes and 
              you are right, the more satisfying recipes you can find the better. 
              I have come to consider other food as poison, as it truly is to 
              my system. Why would I want to eat poison? I equate it with that 
              and it truly helps me. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is frustrating 
              to have all that food around you. I usually make at least two different 
              meals every evening. I have three small children and only the baby 
              isn't tainted by all the other sweet food and loves my food. I have 
              one very picky daughter and sometimes I am making three meals. I 
              try to incorporate some of my food into their meals. We can always 
              incorporate the vegtables. Butternut squash is a favorite with everyone 
              (well except the picky one). It really can be frustrating but I 
              will tell you that it is 1000 times better than being sick and unable 
              to even make dinner. I count my blessings for what I do have instead 
              of focusing on what I can't have. I have my colon and a lot of good 
              food I can eat. I can go out without worrying about a bathroom the 
              whole time. I can take a walk with my family through the woods and 
              enjoy it. What a miracle! Thank God for Elaine and this diet. Sorry 
              for rambling. Good luck to you. Just take it one day at a time and 
              make sure you are never hungry. You know how when you are hungry 
              in the supermarket and you buy more than you can eat because you 
              are starving and then when you aren't hungry or very full you can 
              pass up everything but what is on your list? I think that is one 
              of the most important things. Never let yourself get hungry. <br>

              said. But at the risk of becoming the List's Unofficial Tough Love 
              Guy, I just like to say...what the hell's the matter with you? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You had "mass 
              amount of improvement" after just a couple of weeks on the diet? 
              You've had five surgeries in two years and you "don't know what 
              to do?" Really, what the hell is the matter with you? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You feel left 
              out when your husband and son eat food you cannot, but you don't 
              feel left out when you're staring at the parade of life passing 
              by outside your hospital window? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact is 
              that you do know what to do. Buck up, indeed! You can do whatever 
              you want. The question is, do you want to do it? I'll never understand 
              why people fail to realize just how much they are capable of. For 
              crying out loud, Melanie, you did the diet for two weeks. If you 
              can do it for two weeks, you can do it for two weeks and one day. 
              And if you can do it for two weeks and one day, you can do it for 
              one day more than that. Remember, life isn't lived all at once. 
              Life does not fold in on itself to produce one big omelet of time. 
              Every moment is separate. And every second is an opportunity. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So your husband 
              and son are sitting there chowing down a pizza. Time will erase 
              the moment as it erases everything else. What human beings do wonderfully 
              well is anticipate things which do not yet be. During the longing 
              for a "normal meal" you can envision a day, not yet arrived, when 
              you are free of surgery and you feel the full radiant power of a 
              healed body, strong, and well. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the love 
              of God, quit whining about having more recipes and being scared. 
              It's time to step up. And I know you can do it. Do the diet today. 
              And then forget about today. When tomorrow is today, do the diet 
              again...and then erase that day from your memory. Live in the moment. 
              Don't add up the days or weeks or years. Just eat the right foods, 
              for God's sake, and find the Melanie you never knew existed. She's 
              in there. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi Melanie, 
              I totally understand your problem, since I too have been struggling 
              since August to stay on track. I had a good month back then, but 
              since have been going on and off the diet like a yo yo. I love food 
              too, and as I mentioned recently, I used to be a compulsive eater. 
              I solved the problem, but was used to having moderate amounts of 
              sweets on a regular basis, and limiting my options made me very 
              angry, like a little girl being told NO! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was driving 
              me crazy, because until I stay on it a reasonable amount of time, 
              how can I prove to myself that it works? I realize it has helped 
              so many others, which is why I am eager for the same healing. I 
              have gotten sicker over the last few months. I had one surgery in 
              1999, which was such a trauma for me that I never want to go through 
              that again. I was told last spring that the inflammation has recurred, 
              which is why I am having problems now (D, rectal pain and bleeding, 
              low energy etc.) I recently decided to put a sincere effort to trying 
              SCD, no cheating. I just got myself a buddy on this list, someone 
              to write to each day. I think that will help me. Perhaps you could 
              do the same? Only you can stick to the diet, but it helps to have 
              an experienced person guide you through the rough spots. Of course 
              the entire list is here for you, but maybe an experienced buddy 
              to give you special attention will help. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today is day 
              4 for me, and I am feeling encouraged. I also definitely recommend 
              doing as much cooking of the wonderful foods that we can have, to 
              make your meals as delicious as possible. I have decided that this 
              is essential for me to stay on track. Also, be willing to spend 
              the money to get yourself the best quality foods you can afford. 
              You are worth it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Good luck, and 
              feel free to write me directly if you like. I am still getting my 
              "sea legs", but I am feeling much more confident. I hope you too 
              will find the help you need here. This is a wonderful group. Don't 
              let the Crohn's run your life. You deserve better. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanie, the 
              critters contributing to your illness have physiologically made 
              you addictive. Please don't let them subvert you. Make plenty of 
              goodies - sweet and otherwise from the two books you have always 
              have them on hand. Claire on the list is having the same trouble 
              as you are. If you have stocks of legal foods on hand all the time, 
              you can make a dash for the legals and I think it will satisfy you. 
              If chocolate is driving you crazy, then take a half thimble of chocolate, 
              cut it in half and reward yourself each evening after dinner with 
              a piece of illegal chocolate. If it takes being illegal to get legal 
              - go for it. Love </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hi Melanie I 
              think that alot of us sympathise with you. It takes some patience 
              to stick to any diet. You will find as the months pass that doing 
              the SCD becomes easier and easier. You learn ways of coping for 
              different situations. For example: Eating out at someone elses place- 
              never rely on there being food for you to eat that is legal. Either 
              eat before you go or take your own dish. When you are at home eating 
              with your family you may find that you will be eating something 
              completely different from time to time. I think that you just have 
              to accept this, but perhaps you could make something that closely 
              resembles what they are eating. I would also suggest that you have 
              1-2 sessions of baking a week so that you can freeze food to use 
              when you are pushed for time or simply can't be bothered. When you 
              are out and about always take a snack with you e.g nuts and fruit, 
              fruit leather, banana You never know when something is going to 
              prevent you from getting home to prepare SCD food. For you at the 
              moment it seems that celebations are impossible times to stick to 
              a diet, but it can be done. For example, when I went to someones 
              Thanksgiving meal, I first off asked what food would be available 
              and then took along my own dishes. I took Kerrie's Green bean and 
              Almond dish and Nancy's Pecan Pie. I was able to eat the asparagus 
              and turkey that was already there. Everyone loved the dishes that 
              I took along (thanks Kerrie and Nancy). Over Christmas we had people 
              to stay. It was the first time that I was able to successfully cope 
              without cheating or going hungry. Before they arrived I decided 
              what I was going to cook for them for the entire time they were 
              here (2 1/2 weeks) and also what I was going to eat. (I tried to 
              make my dishes closely resemble theirs although I didn't always 
              manage, but that didn't matter) While they were here I made sure 
              that I had muffins in the freezer and that the yoghurt was in plentyful 
              supply. When taking them sightseeing I always took snacks and soup 
              with me just in case they wanted to stop off at a restaurant or 
              something. If I was able to eat something at the restaurant then 
              great, but if not, so what. </font></p>
