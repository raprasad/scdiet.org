                    Subject: 6 month report <br>
                    Date: Sun, 7 Jan 2001</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings: 
                    <br>
                    Yesterday I hit the 6-month mark on following the diet rigorously, 
                    so thought I'd take the opportunity to give a testimonial. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To give 
                    a little history: I started seeing occasional B on stool around 
                    6/98 (at age 43). Fall of '99, started seeing M, plus B on 
                    its own. Gas, bloating, urgency, and occasionally what seemed 
                    to me explosive M. Occasional D or loose stool. This was all 
                    more annoying than debilitating, so I didn't race to the doctor. 
                    I started keeping a food/symptoms diary in March 2000. I noticed 
                    during Passover that my symptoms lessened (I would have been 
                    eating far fewer illegals during that week.) I got diagnosed 
                    6/00 with UC and was put on Asacol. Shortly after, found out 
                    about the diet from the Internet, and started cutting out 
                    foods. It made immediate sense to me, especially with the 
                    evidence from my own body from Passover, even though my GI, 
                    like just about everyone else's, denied the power of diet 
                    in this illness. Still, it took a few weeks til I decided 
                    to really commit myself to it. Took Asacol for 3 months, then 
                    when my prescription ran out and couldn't be automatically 
                    renewed, I decided to stop it. Early in the diet I noticed 
                    some lessening of gas and urgency, but was still seeing B 
                    and M. I seemed to improve more once I stopped the Asacol, 
                    but was still seeing B and M. Currently I am very close to 
                    symptom free. I have not seen any B since early Nov. (that 
                    was 5 months into the diet), and am only seeing occasional 
                    small amounts of M--maybe twice a week, as opposed to every 
                    time I sat on the toilet before I started the diet. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm feeling 
                    very pleased with the diet and have been telling lots of people 
                    about it--I'm finding, as others have, that there's an IBD/IBS 
                    sufferer or relative of one everywhere you look. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think 
                    not getting hit with this illness til age 43 made me very 
                    skeptical of my doctor's claim that I would have to take medicine 
                    to control it for the rest of my life, and I am pleased to 
                    have proven him wrong. It still seems to me that my body should 
                    return to its former excellent digestion on or off SCD, but 
                    I have absolutely no plans to go off the diet. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to 
                    what brought the disease on, my best guess was my diet. I 
                    had been a vegetarian for about 20 years when symptoms showed 
                    up, and had been eating a nearly vegan diet for probably the 
                    last 7 to 10 of those years. (I hadn't eaten refined sweeteners 
                    in probably 15 years, and maybe that slowed the onset of the 
                    disease.) I think I eventually overwhelmed my body's ability 
                    to digest foods like grains and beans. I'm now eating lots 
                    of eggs, legal dairy, and some fish (as well as vegetables 
                    and fruits). Am still struggling with feelings about eating 
                    fish, and may remove it from my diet in the future, but it 
                    seems to make sense to eat it right now. (I haven't tried 
                    adding beans in yet, and won't for a while.) </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm grateful 
                    to the diet not just for my health, but for this great food. 
                    I'm eating better than I ever have. I had been a chocolate 
                    fan in former days, but I find that I don't much miss it, 
                    and that not being able to eat it has given me the chance 
                    to eat things with other flavors that I had always liked--like 
                    lemon and coconut--but which had taken a back seat to chocolate. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends 
                    and family have been supportive. Last week, I planned to have 
                    dinner with a male friend. We had a phone conversation during 
                    which he grilled me on what I could and couldn't eat, taking 
                    notes on his computer. He arrived later that day with 2 bags 
                    of legal groceries which we turned into a lovely meal. What 
                    a treat! </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And another 
                    thing I'm grateful for, which I know my mother would tell 
                    me not to discuss in public, is that if I have gas, I no longer 
                    have to hold it in, for fear of something coming out with 
                    it! That and the return of other ordinary bodily functions, 
                    like just feeling hungry, have also been a pleasure. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enough 
                    of this. Thanks to Elaine and everyone else. I think being 
                    on this list, even as a quiet member, has made all the difference 
                    in being able to stick to the diet. I love feeling like part 
                    of a community of people who are in this together. </font></p>
