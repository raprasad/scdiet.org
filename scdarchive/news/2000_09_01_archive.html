          This article about <a href="http://www.mucus-dialogue.com/mucus01/muceng01.html">mucus</a> supports the theory that the SCD might positively change the types of proteinases produced in the gut buy changing the flora, or other factors. Without the SCD, the mucus layer is usually
damaged thus letting bio molecules cross the gut barrier and setting up an immune cascade.

that I should eat mainly white starch, was instrumental in making sure 
there was absolutely no mention of BTVC at any CCFA meeting or 
event.  After all, if every patient found out about it, think of the money 
it would cost him.  I'm sure he lost a good $50K because I, miraculously, 
heard about the diet when Elaine was on Dr. Hoffman's radio show.  His loss 
would probably be no more than that, as I imagine I would have died before 
he made any more money out of me.  I was *very* sick, and as it was, I 
almost died from the effects of the Prednisone.

          <b>How food contributes to IBD and IBS</b><br>While most MDs indicate "food has nothing to do with Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis" (how many times have you heard <i>that</i>?!), the researchers do understand the food connection.  As Elaine Gottscall, B.A., M.Sc. pointed out after reading a new research article, the researchers are quoted as "...producing ulcerative colitis creating inflammatory bowel disease in mice. A chronic colitis was induced by feeding dextran sulphate sodium to the mice over several weeks.."  According to Elaine, "Dextran sulphate is a molecule very much like heparin (anticoagulant) and like carrageenan and also like some of the starches used in processed foods called modified starches.  So the docs know that these things can create ulcerative colitis!"  At least the researchers acknowledge that eating the wrong food contributes to IBD.. the docs seem to be in denial, wanting to prescribe drugs that mask the symptoms instead of tackling the problem at the root cause.<p>  The full article is titled: <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7260/530">New cytokine treatment for inflammatory bowel disease</a>.<br>

          Why don't more people know about the SCD?  Why do so few doctors promote it?  Here's another pithy nugget from Elaine:<br>
<font color="999999">"...Patrick sent me a wonderfully succint essay of research in England where I
believe the first work was done to show that predevelopment of Crohn's, the
diet is much higher in refined sugar.  He said, and I agree, that some of
the best nutritional research is coming from the UK.  But that the medical
association is so strong that none of it gets incorporated.  My cynical  view is
like many of yours [fellow SCD-ers].  It is not the quantity of research which will zero in
on treating a disease but the amount of money the treatment generates.
Telling people to change their diet from high carb to low would take money
away from all big industries like grain food production and pharmaceuticals."</font><br>
