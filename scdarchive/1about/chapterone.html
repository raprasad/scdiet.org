                    1951, after many years of clinical experience, Drs. Sidney 

                    V. and Merrill P. Haas published a book entitled <strong>Management 

                    of Celiac Disease</strong>. Directed to the medical community, 

                    the book documented the doctors' experiences in treating and 

                    curing hundreds of cases of celiac disease as well as cases 

                    of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. Their approach was dietary, 

                    and they used a well-balanced, normal diet that was highly 

                    specific as to the types of sugars and starches allowed. When 

                    patients followed this Specific Carbohydrate Diet for a minimum 

                    of one year, they were then able to return to normal diet 

                    with complete and permanent disappearance of symptoms. </font></p></blockquote>

                          1958, we took our eight year old daughter to the Drs. 

                          Haas. Three years before she had been diagnosed by specialists 

                          as having incurable ulcerative colitis and her condition 

                          was deteriorating. The years of treatment with cortisone 

                          and sulfonamides, plus innumerable other medical approaches, 

                          had been unsuccessful and surgery seemed imminent. The 

                          Drs. Haas placed her on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet 

                          and within two years she was free of symptoms. She returned 

                          to eating normally after another few years, and has 

                          remained in excellent health for over twenty years.

                          students, friends, and others whom I have seen in my 

                          practice who were suffering from ulcerative colitis, 

                          Crohn's disease, celiac disease (not cured by a gluten-free 

                          diet), diverticulitis, and various types of chronic 

                          diarrhea have tried the Haas Diet and most of them are 

                          now free of their respective diseases. Some of the most 

                          dramatic and fastest recoveries have occurred in babies 

                          and young children with severe constipation and among 

                          children who, along with intestinal problems, had serious 

                          behavior problems. These included autistic-type hyperactivity 

                          as well as hyperactivity, often accompanied by severe 

                          and prolonged night terrors. Very often the behavior 

                          problems and night terrors cleared up within ten days 

                          after initiation of the Haas Specific Carbohydrate Diet. 

                          It is interesting to note that in June, 1985, the Schizophrenia 

                          Association of Great Britain launched a research project 

                          to investigate Dr. F. C. Dohan's research concerning 

                          a relationship between celiac disease and schizophrenia. 

                          The basis for this project is a strict grain-free, milk-free, 

                          low sugar diet, closely related to the Specific Carbohydrate 

                          Diet. </font></p>

                          in research laboratories throughout the world, investigators 

                          have been studying intestinal problems. Physicians and 

                          researchers have found that a special type of synthetic 

                          diet (chemical nutrients assembled in the laboratory) 

                          called an Elemental Diet shows great promise in the 

                          treatment of digestive and intestinal problems of all 

                          types. The malabsorption problem seen in cystic fibrosis 

                          of the pancreas as well as diarrhea which occurs after 

                          cancer chemotherapy have been overcome by the use of 

                          the synthetic Elemental Diet. When used for patients 

                          with Crohn's disease, not only did symptoms disappear 

                          but children who had not grown properly for years showed 

                          dramatic weight and height gains while on the diet. 

                          The level of sodium chloride in the perspiration (the 

                          sweat test which measures the severity of the condition) 

                          of children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas decreased 

                          dramatically when these children were given the Elemental 

                          Diet. Over six hundred scientific publications have 

                          appeared in medical journals in the 1970's and early 

                          1980's testifying to the fact that this Elemental Diet 

                          is effective in correcting malabsorption and reversing 

                          the course of many intestinal disorders. However, since 

                          the Elemental Diet is an artificial diet, usually administered 

                          via a stomach tube, it cannot be continued indefinitely. 

                          When it is discontinued, usually after six to eight 

                          weeks, improvement gradually decreases and symptoms 

                          usually return. </font></p>

                          need not feel deprived. Many of the delicious recipes 

                          in this book could easily be part of any gourmet cookbook. 

                          The fact that they are so appealing, however, in no 

                          way compromises the underlying scientific reasoning: 

                          the carbohydrates specified in the recipes are biochemically 

                          correct. </font></p>
