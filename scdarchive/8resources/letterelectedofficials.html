      <p><a href="http://www.congress.org/">http://www.congress.org/search.html</a> 
      <p>If you live in Canada, then you can find your reps here: <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/house/PostalCode.asp?Source=SM">http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/house/PostalCode.asp?Source=SM</a> 
      <p>Everyone's experience with this disease is different. Feel free to use 
        this as a guide if you want to, or write your own letter. If you live 
        in Canada, please make sure you change the NIH to whatever the canadian 
        equivalent is....I think it is the Canadian Institutes of Health Research 
        (CIHR), but i'm not certain on this. I've put my notes in <>.
      <p>Plan on having your family members and friends send in letters as well. 
        If we can get 3 people for every member on this list to send in mail, 
        then we could have 1,500 letters........or more......for each of our representatives. 
      <p>The mailing addresses for the CCFA and CCFC are:

      <p>Dear <insert your rep here> Senator &lt;elected official's name here&gt;: 
      <p>I am writing to you on behalf of thousands of <insert country here> US 
        citizens who are suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). <insert 
your story here> When I was 13 years old, I became extremely ill with a form of 
        IBD called Crohn's Disease. The details of my life with this disease are 
        too depressing and too long to include in a short letter. Suffice it to 
        say, the medications the doctors prescribed to treat the pain, diarrhea, 
        fistulas, and suffering related to this disease were less than ideal. 
        I've seen several specialists since my original diagnosis and none could 
        offer any further relief. 
      <p>Two years ago I found a book entitled, "Breaking the Vicious Cycle" written 
        by Elaine Gottschall, MS Biochemistry. The book detailed a diet based 
        treatment for IBD related illnesses. I had nothing to lose at that point 
        in my life, so I gave the diet a try. Within a month I was off all of 
        my medication and my symptoms were 90 percent gone. After two years of 
        staying on the diet, I am now 100 percent symptom free. Some of my doctors 
        have been more encouraging than others. Most of them do not believe my 
        remission has been induced by the diet. This is why I am writing to you 
        today. 
      <p>The diet is called the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, has been around for 
        decades, and is based on sound scientific principles. However, it is not 
        well received by the medical community because there hasn't been a study 
        performed to evaluate its effectiveness. Please <insert reps name here> 
        Senator Clinton, I implore you to contact the <insert your countrys 
funding branch here> National Institute of Health (NIH) on our behalf to reserve 
        funding for such a study. I truly believe that this diet could save hundreds 
        of thousands of people from needless suffering. I know that if my specialists 
        had advised me of such a diet when I was 13, I could have been saved from 
        11 years of suffering. Thank you for listening, 
      <p>&lt;your name here&gt;<insert phone number here>
