<a name="smodri"><h3>Smoothy (Drink)</h3></a>
<p>
2 cups orange juice<br>
1 cup frozen strawberries (or fresh with ice cubes)<br>
1 banana (broken up)<br>
<p>
Blend all of these ingredients together in a blender. I guess you could add
honey if you wanted to but it is tasty enough as it is. I usually add more
banana.

<a name="barsau"><h3>Bar-B-Q Sauce</h3></a>
<p>
I confess. I am a bar-b-q sauce addict. Before I went on this diet, I ate
store bought bar-b-q sauce with EVERYTHING. When I went on the diet I had to
make my own. I just follow the Ketchup recipe in Elaine Gottschall's book
but add chopped garlic, onion, and parsley to make it chunky like bar-b-q
sauce. It tastes just as good as the store bought and works just as good
on food. Just a suggestion.

<a name="oilvindre"><h3>Oil and Vinegar Dressing</h3></a>
<p>
I didn't like the vinaigrette dressing given in the book. I like this one
better:
<p>
3 parts vinegar<br>
4 parts honey<br>
7 parts oil<br>
<p>
I actually add only 3 parts oil. That last part is optional.

6 slices of bacon (or less)<br>
1 hard boiled egg, chopped<br>

1/4 tsp. Pepper<br>
1 Tbsp. Honey<br>
<p>
Saute bacon until very crisp.  Remove and drain on paper towel.  Slowly add
vinegar, pepper, and honey to bacon grease.  Stir.  Heat to boiling.  Remove
from heat & add onions.  Place washed spinach in salad bowl.  Add chopped
egg & crumbled bacon.  Slowly pour hot dressing on & toss lightly.  Serve at

<p>
Sprinkle with parmesan cheese<br>
Top with crumbled cooked bacon<br>
<p>
Variations:  Use cheddar cheese, grated, instead of parmesan.  I like to do
this salad in a deep clear bowl and repeat the layers.  It is very pretty
this way.

<a name="peayogshe"><h3>Peach Yogurt Sherbet</h3></a>
<p>
1 pound (4 or 5) ripe peaches, yields about 2 cups prepared fruit<br>
1 small medium ripe banana<br>
1 cup plain, low fat yogurt  (I used my very rich fat filled yogurt instead)<br>
2-3 Tblsp honey<br>
2 tsp vanilla extract
<p>
Blanch the peaches in boiling water for 20 seconds.  Refresh under cold water
and remove the skins.  Remove the pits and slice.  Peel and slice the banana.
Freeze the fruit in plastic bags.  (I chopped the fruit up first before
freezing)  When frozen solid, remove from the freezer and pound to break into
chunks.  ( I found no need to pound, it simply broke into pieces in a few
minutes.)<br>
Place the yogurt, honey, and vanilla in a food processor.  Add the frozen fruit.
Using the pulse action, process until the fruit is mashed.  Then turn on the
processor and blend until you have a smooth puree.  Serve as is or return
to the freezer.  It will keep several weeks in the freezer.<br>

Combine one beaten egg, 3/4 cup yogurt, and 1/6 cup oil.  Stir this into dry

Use a hot griddle or frying pan.  Start with small size as they may be hard

<li>I added a bit of cinnamon to the muffins, which was a good change.
<li>I also used the sweet and sour lentil recipe but instead of using lentils
I used a combination of some green beans, peas and some onions.  I cooked the
beans and peas in the microwave, sauteed the onions in the butter and combined
everything together for a few minutes till it was hot then I put it in the refrigerator to make a cold "three" bean like salad.

Topping:
<ul>
<li>1 medium-size butternut squash (about 1 1/2 pounds), halved lengthwise,
seeded, pared and cut into 1-inch cubes

<li>4 Tablespoons butter
<li>3/4 cup homemade yogurt
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
<li>1/8 teaspoon ground hot red pepper (cayenne)

Filling:
<ul>
<li>2 Tablespoons vegetable oil
<li>3 medium-size onions, chopped
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
<li>1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
<li>1 tablespoon leaf basil, crumbled
<li>1 tablespoon leaf oregano, crumbled
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin
<li>1 teaspoon salt
<li>1/2 teaspoon leaf thyme, crumbled
<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper
<li>12 ounce tomato juice
<li>2 tomatoes, cut in pieces [I used the equivalent amount of cherry tomatoes,
halved]
<li>1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch lengths [I used split peas, which I soaked overnight, although next time, I might also consider
adding chopped carrots]
</ul>
Directions:
<ol>
<li><b>Prepare Topping:</b>  Drop squash and cauliflower into large pot with enough
cold, salted water to cover vegetables by 1 inch.  Partially cover and
bring to boiling.  Boil 15 minutes or until tender.
<li>Drain squash and cauliflower; return to pot.    Add butter, yogurt, salt,
black pepper, nutmeg and red pepper.  Mash with potato masher until fluffy.
Cool slightly.  Reserve egg and paprika.
<li>Preheat oven to moderate (375&deg F.).
<li><b>Prepare Filling:</b>  Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion;
saute until softened, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic; cook 1 minute.  Remove to
plate.
<li>Crumble beef into skillet; cook over medium-high until browned, about 3
minutes. Stir in basil, oregano, cumin, salt, thyme, pepper, and reserved
onion mixture.  Add tomato juice, tomatoes, and green beans (or whatever vegetables you've chosen).  Bring to boiling.  Lower heat; cover and cook 10 minutes (longer if added vegetables are not yet tender).  Spoon into
13 X 9 X 2-inch glass baking dish.
<li>Beat egg into squash-cauliflower mixture.  Spread evenly over filling,

Anyone out there hungry for a crunchy snack?  I tried one tonight that turned

goes . . . .
<p>
Heat your griddle or heavy skillet.<br>
Drop shredded cheese on the hot griddle in a thin layer.<br>
Keep it on low heat until the cheese melts, then begins to brown and crunch.<br>
Flip the cheese so the other side will get crunchy, too.
<p>
Eat hot or cold with salsa or plain.
<p>
You can make the cheese chips bite size or make one enormous chip and then
break it up to whatever size you like.
<p>
We haven't tried storing these yet - I'm not sure what will work for that -
But I do know they are great fresh . . . and they CRUNCH like a chip!!

<a name="peabutbal"><h3>Peanut Butter Balls</h3></a>
<p>
1/2 cup peanut butter<br>
1/2 cup creamy/solid type honey (not liquid honey)<br>
1/2 cup almond flour<br>
chopped peanuts
<p>
Mix peanut butter, honey, almond flour together.  Roll by hand into balls.
Roll balls in chopped nuts to coat the outside.  I keep them in the fridge
and they have a pretty nice consistency then.

<a name="hottunchisal"><h3>Hot Tuna or Chicken Salad</h3></a>
<p>
Can of tuna or equivalent of shredded chicken<br>
2 tbsp yogurt<br>
1 tsp prepared mustard<br>
chopped onions<br>
shredded cheddar cheese<br>
salt (optional)
<p>
Mix the above ingredients and then warm in the microwave until the
cheese melts.  The original recipe was for a Grilled Tuna sandwich,
so for those people who make their own bread this would make a great
grilled sandwich as well.
<p>
I liked this recipe because it's lower in fat than if you had used
mayonnaise.

Just wanted to pass along this recipe I came across which fits the SCD
perfectly!  It is a very moist and delicious carrot cake with a hint of
orange.   We found it to be very much like a 'real cake'.   I was so
suprised that the recipe did not call for flour.
<p>
6 eggs, seperated<br>
1 cup honey<br>
1 1/2 cups carrots, cooked and pureed<br>
1 Tlbs grated orange rind<br>
1 Tlbs frozen orange juice<br>
3 cups almond flour
<p>
Preheat over to 325&deg F.<br>
Beat the egg yolks and honey together.  Mix in carrot puree, orange rind,
orange juice and almond flour.  Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold in.
Spoon into a greased loose bottomed 9 inch springform pan.  Bake for about
50 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out
clean.  Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to
cool completely.<br>
This cake looks great, tastes wonderful alone but it is
also very nice served with the Honey Cream Whipped Topping (Page 110,
Breaking the Vicious Cycle).

We found our Yogurt Maker in a Health Food Store.    The brand is Yogourmet
II Electric Yogurt Maker.  It makes great yogurt always very thick and
creamy much nicer than any commercial yogurt I ever tried.<br>
The company you could contact to find out where to purchase one in your area is <address>Lyo-San Inc.<br>
C.P. 598<br>
Lachute, QC [Quebec], CANADA<br>
J8H 4G4<br>
The phone # is 1-514-562-8525</address>
<p>
We have tried other yogurt makers but never got the excellent quality yogurt
we get with the Yogourmet II.  Actually this brand was recommonded to us by
Lucy Rosset (Ist Testimonial on the back cover of Breaking the Vicious
Cycle.  Hope this info helps.

These are not my recipes, in fact, I haven't even tried them yet.  But I
found them on a 
<a href="ftp://ftp.nmcs.com/pub/lowcarb/recipes/">low-carb recipe page
[ ftp://ftp.nmcs.com/pub/lowcarb/recipes/ ]</a>.<br>
They look like they work for the diet and are potentially very tasty.
<p><ol>
<li>cut eggplant into slices (1/2 in thick) or 1 in cubes.
<li>cook eggplant until tender but not mushy
    <ul>
    <li>steam in veggie/rice steamer left over from vlf days
        (10 minutes)
    <li>or in a pot with a lid and 1/2in water (8 minutes)
    <li>or microwave in some water until tender (only did
        this once, I think it was about 5 min.)
    </ul>
<li>put eggplant in something that can microwave or go under
      the broiler or in the toaster oven (or back in the pot,
      if that's all you have).  Add a little spaghetti sauce,

Take boneless chicken breasts and cut with a meat scissor in the shape
of fries and then deep fry till golden brown and faily well done.  Add some
homemade catsup and use your imagination... also chicken nuggets
taste great with an egg batter and powdered garlic and onion coating
(no breading) make great finger snack... make them small and eat like
peanuts.

<p>
1 medium onion - coarsely chopped<br>
8 oz mushrooms - quartered<br>
6 japanesse eggplants - cut in cubes<br>
<table border=0>
<td> &nbsp </td>
<td>(or one large regular eggplant, the japanesse are sweeter in my
     opinion. If you use regular eggplant, you may want to salt and
     drain for a couple of hours.)</td>

3/4 HEAD of garlic - crushed or chopped fine<br>
<table border=0>

<td><b>NOTE:</b> that's HEAD not clove, yes, a lot of garlic
      you can use less if you really want to.</td>

1 cup water<br>
1 Tablespoon dried basil or 1/4 cup fresh chopped salt and pepper to
taste.
<p>
In a large heavy bottomed pan (or dutch oven), sautee (in water or veggie
stock) onions over medium heat until soft and sweet. Add mushrooms, eggplant,
garlic and water. Keep on med - high heat stiring occationally until the water
is boiling (about 2 min). Turn down heat to a simmer and cover about 1/2 hour
or until eggplant is done and very soft (regular eggplant may take a bit
longer).<br>
Add basil, salt and pepper to taste. Reheat when ready to serve.

darkened and tender. When all the aubergine is cooked put it aside.
Heat some sunflower oil and cook the mince until just brown, adding the
pressed garlic in the last minute or two.<br>

  Wash lemon grass and trim root ends and tough layers.  Slice bottom 6
  inches thinly.  Chop 1 T. of this.  Puree chopped lemon grass, 1 T. of
  sliced ginger, garlic, peppercorns, coriander roots and shallots. Bring
  1 cup of coconut milk to boil and add lemon grass mixture.  While
  stirring, reduce heat to medium and add chicken, remaining coconut milk,
  ginger slices and lemon grass.  Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer
  uncovered until chicken is tender.  Season with chilies, fish sauce and
  lime juice.  Decorate servings with lime leaves and coriander sprigs.
<p>
<b>To make coconut milk:</b> Blend 2 cups fresh or frozen grated coconut with
  water.  Strain through double cheesecloth, pressing out all liquid.
  This is thick coconut milk.  To get thin milk, add warm water to residue
  from first straining.  Let stand 5 minutes, then press as before.
<p>
  For coconut cream, refrigerate first pressing and cream will rise to
  top.  Refrigerate or freeze.  Two cups coconut makes 3 cups thick milk,
  of which 6 tablespoons is cream.
