Dear Ms. Gottschall:<BR><BR>

After reading not one, but two scathing reviews on your book <I>Breaking the 
Vicious Cycle</I>, I want to let you know that I disagree with both of 
them, and would like to have my say in your defense.
<BR> <BR> 
The reviews in the Canadian Celiac Association newsletters (Spring and
Summer, 1996) are irresponsible and in my opinion, enough to alarm any
starving gluten intolerant soul in to bypassing your book and robbing
themselves of an opportunity to get well.<BR> <BR> 

First a bit about me. After eight years of mysterious symptoms, dozens
of doctors, gruelling, and often humiliating tests and general misery I
discovered I was gluten intolerant. I probably would never have figures
it out if it hadn't been for my sister.<BR> <BR> 

After checking herself into a psychiatric ward in Vancouver, an
observant nurse and doctor deduced that all my sister's miseries were
linked to celiac disease. (A positive biopsy confirmed that she was
indeed celiac.) Because of her history, my doctor and I discovered that
gluten was also the cause of my maladies. I had no desire to go back on
gluten to have the biopsy done. My doctor and specialist are both aware
of my condition and the decision not to have the biopsy. Since my
&quot;assumptive&quot; diagnosis, there have been two more positive biopsies in
our family. My eight-year-old daughter has also since been diagnosed a
celiac. My gastroenterologist and I decided the biopsy was unnecessary
and unless further problems developed, she should remain on a
gluten-free diet too.<BR> <BR> 

Unfortunately, for both my daughter, another sister (in Manitoba) and I,
the gluten-free diet did not work. Some symptoms were arrested, but none
of us were thriving and we just weren't absorbing food. (My sister in
Vancouver and a niece in Alberta have been successful with the
fluten-free diet however.)<BR> <BR> 

A friend of mine (suffering from M.S.) recommended your book. She told
me that although it wasn't curing her, it was definitely helping her
live a healthier life.<BR> <BR> 

To make a long story short, we found the diet (for whatever reason) to
be a godsend. Contrary to J. A. Campbell's point (#4), &quot;The diet is very
restrictive and difficult to prepare...&quot;, I find all but the pizza
recipe (where you have to squeeze water out of a zucchini a snap to
cook) very easy. The almond muffins are no more difficult to prepare
than any other kind of muffin. (In fact, easier, because you make the
whole thing in one food processor - no dishes, no fuss.) I can make the
yoghurt in my sleep and everyone (including guests) loves it. As for the
zucchini, if I'm organized, I just let it drain from a strainer for ages
and sill end up with a good pizza.<BR> <BR> 

<CENTER><P><HR WIDTH="25%"></P></CENTER><BR>

As for not being nutritious, I have never been healthier. My daughter,
once a sicly (often whiney) withdrawn child with thin heair and dark
circles under her eyes is outgoing, rosy cheeked and happy. Everyone has
noticed her thick, shiny hair. In fact, she ran a marathon in Owen Sound
this year and placed 15th out of 79 children. Last year she ran the same
race (before the diet) and placed 53rd, arrived weepy and slept all the
way home in the car.<BR> <BR> 

Tackling the diet is overwhelming to be sure. Anything different is a
challenge. Instead of diving in headfirst, I tried one recipe at a time.
My sister (skeptical of your diet) visited me last summer and I showed
her how to change her kitchen, shopping habits and cooking. She loved
the food but didn't notice that some of her symptoms had disappeared
until she went home and went back on the gluten-free diet. She is now
back on your diet and happy with it.<BR> <BR> 

In #1, in the review by Mavis Molloy, she states that &quot;...it is both
expensive and time consuming to prepare.&quot; Good food is time consuming to
prepare, no matter what kind of diet it is. As for expense, again good,
real food costs more than convenience food, but I find you need less
<I>real</I> food than what most of us are used to eating to get the right
amount of nutrition. And has she ever priced gluten-free bread? Rice
flour? Not to mention the new gluten free treats that are being churned
out (many fo them heavily-laden with new and exciting (untested)
ingredients?<BR> <BR> 

She also says &quot;...that it is unnecessary to eliminate... starches such
as corn, rice, potato, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, etc.&quot; So far I
haven't met any celiacs who don't have problems with corn, and buckwheat
isn't exactly a hit either.<BR> <BR> 

The most important fact about your book is totally missed by both
reviewers. It boils down to common sense. I find you are very careful
about explaining why and how things don't and do work - right down to
common sense things like if you have four muffins at once, no matter
what they're made of, they're not going to work. You'd be amazed at how
many people don't have enough common sense to see why moderation is so
important. If you're not absorbing nutrients it doesn't matter what your
disease is called or who has researched what, it's time to try something
else, before drugs and scalpels are necessary. As we know, radical
surgery and drugs often cure the immediate problem but open the doors to
others.<BR> <BR>

I have been on the diet since January, 1996, still have a way to go, but
my life has changed drastically since. I have much more enery, cirtually
no pain anywhere (before my list of symptoms was endless) and no longer
spend half my life in the bathroom where my life was literally going
down the drain. I was underweight, had dry pale skin, dull-looking dry
eyes, suffered from hair loss and was generally miserable. Now I am
actively pursuing my art interests (something I always had inside me,
but didn't have the energy or drive to tackle it.)<BR> <BR> 

Had I seen and heeded the alarming &quot;Celiac Beware&quot; headline in the CCA
Newsletter before I tackled &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot;, I'd be too
tired to even write a letter like this.<BR> <BR> 

Feel free to use my letter (or me for that matter.) There's enough
unnecessary suffering out there and there is nothing to lose by trying
this book.

Sincerely<BR> <BR> 

Jennifer Stenberg.<BR> <BR>
