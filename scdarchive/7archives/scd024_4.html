<BR>
I was on a diet very similar to SCD for 5 months prior to starting SCD.  <BR>
It was essentially the same except for potatoes and white rice.  I stuck <BR>
to the diet very closely, the only exceptions were that I pureed a few <BR>
additional cooked veggies into the soup. (My naturopath said she had <BR>
never seen anyone stick to a diet as well as me)  I was not able to <BR>
stomach either the yoghurt or the DCCC.  After two weeks I had lost an <BR>
additional 10 lbs. (above  the 15 - 20 I had already lost on the <BR>
previous diet (all under the guidance of a naturopath)&amp; the 30 lbs under <BR>
weight for my body size and shape) I am also intolerant of chicken, <BR>
turkey, &amp; eggs.  For those who have had the test from the Great Smokies <BR>
lab my Fecal sigA was 900 (44-180 is normal).  My last colonoscopy (near <BR>
the end of being on the diet) showed increase (now total) inflammation <BR>
of the colon.<BR>
<BR>
On the diet my continual pain stayed the same, my D increased, my amount <BR>
of blood increased, I was so weak that I was no longer able to work more <BR>
than 0-3 hours a day, and my wife said that my personality changed and <BR>
that I was not the same person she married.  Since going off the diet <BR>
I've essentially stopped bleeding, minimal D, less fatigue, but <BR>
increased gas, mucus, and slightly increased pain while eliminating. <BR>
(and I've gained 20 lbs in two + weeks) <BR>
<BR>
My dad had his colon removed before I was born and lived a very active <BR>
(hiking / biking / skiing / camping / canoe trips / 5 kids / etc.) life.  <BR>
I am unable to work a full day at a desk job or leave my house at night.  <BR>
After much thought, reading, discussion with my family (and those with <BR>
ostomys) and prayer, I've scheduled the surgery for a few weeks out.  <BR>
I'm glad that the diet seems to be working for most of you, and I wish <BR>
that it had for me, but I feel that I can no longer deal with the <BR>
continual pain and being unable to lead a &quot;normal&quot; life.  My dad had <BR>
1000 times the life I have now.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry this was so long, but it feels good to write it out and think <BR>
through things one more time.  <BR>
<BR>
God Bless and good luck,<BR>

Subject: <B>NEWS FLASH!! CCFA ACKNOWLEDGES SCD!!!</B><BR>
<BR>
CCFA members: check your snail-mail today - I just received CCFA's<BR>
&quot;Foundation Focus&quot; magazine, with a cover story on nutrition (imagine<BR>
that!).  The extensive article mentions Elaine Gottschall and BTVC:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;One diet that generates much comment is the specific carbohydrate<BR>
diet, presented by Elaine Gottschall in _Breaking the Vicious Cycle:<BR>
Intestinal Health Through Diet_.  The rationale for this diet is that<BR>
carbohydrates that require no digestion are less likely to overly<BR>
stimulate intestinal bacteria, and thus, the inflammatory symptoms of<BR>
IBD.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;'There are no controlled data to support the use of the Gottschall<BR>
diet,' notes Dr. Greenberg.  'Although the diet is balanced and<BR>
varied, a potential problem is that patients often lose weight when<BR>
adhering to a specific diet.  I would strongly advise patients<BR>
interested in following this diet to do so only under the supervision<BR>
of physicians and nutritionists.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
OK, so it's not a glowing recommendation, but it's not critical<BR>
either, and I'll bet it'll stimulate readers' interest.  I consider<BR>
this a coup for Elaine and SCD, as the diet has now been publicized to<BR>
the vast masses of IBD patients who may never have stumbled across SCD<BR>
before, but who do receive &quot;Foundation Focus.&quot;<BR>

Subject: <B>PLEASE HELP ME</B><BR>
<BR>
I haven't been regularly reading the posts from this list. We have been<BR>
struggling.  I can tell you, I am close to giving up on the SCD.  I am<BR>
desolated, devastated.  I do not know what to do.  Life is hell. Waking up<BR>
in the morning is an experience fraught with horror.<BR>
My daughter has been on the SCD since Boxing Day 1997.   For ten months we<BR>
have not cheated.  For ten months I have become so polysaccharide-aware<BR>
that I almost have a pathological hatred of starchy sugary foods, on my<BR>
daughter's behalf.   At first the diet seemed to be working - albeit<BR>
slowly. It took almost six months to wean her off cortisone.  For 2 1/2<BR>
months this year she was off all drugs but not really well. She lacked<BR>
energy and appetite, was weak and listless, still was going to the toilet<BR>
several times a day.  Yet she was managing well enough to go to school<BR>
again, at least a few days per week, and we were filled with hope - at last<BR>
she was off the drugs.  We thought things could only get better.<BR>
In the middle of August this year she caught a cold. This triggered a flare<BR>
of her symptoms.  We battled on with the diet but eventually things got so<BR>
bad she had to go back on cortisone.  She has been on cortisone for 13<BR>
months out of the last 15.  This is so bad for her little body, I cannot<BR>
bear to contemplate it.  NO-ONE, least of all a child, is supposed to be on<BR>
cortisone more than 3 months out of 12. This drug may be giving my baby a<BR>
bearable present life but what is it doing to her future?  She is still on<BR>
cortisone.  Over the last two months we have had to INCREASE the dose, not<BR>
decrease it.  Currently she is on the highest dose she has ever had.<BR>
What's more, the doctor recently tested her blood and all the readings for<BR>
vitamins, minerals and amino acids came up dangerously low.  The doctor was<BR>
shocked and immediately ordered intravenous vitamin transfusions. The<BR>
result immediately after the first transfusion was amazing.  My daughter<BR>
actually started to laugh and speak, and her cheeks were pink for the first<BR>
time in months.  She has not been absorbing any goodness for months.  All<BR>
the supplements I give her are not doing her any good.  How can she heal if<BR>
she is not being nourished?  She had the vitamin levels of a famine victim. <BR>
If you could see this child you would know why I am crying and dying<BR>
inside.  She is as sweet as an angel.  She does not complain, but eats and<BR>
drinks all the strange concoctions set before her, and tries to smile and<BR>
says she will be better soon. She is the dearest little thing who just<BR>
wants to be well enough to play with her friends and go to school to learn<BR>
about plants and animals, so she can be a botanist or a vet. She has never<BR>
hurt anything or anyone and sometimes I just cannot believe that such a<BR>
thing could happen to such a dear, darling person. She has not even had the<BR>
chance to have a childhood. I would rather, a million billion times over,<BR>
that it was me.<BR>
So after ten months on the SCD we are back to square one. I had such hope<BR>
and faith.  But what do I do?  I feel like giving up on the diet but what<BR>
choice do I have?<BR>
My daughter is only eating meats, cooked fruits and cooked vegetables. This<BR>
is SO LIMITING.  I sometimes wonder if it is just another tyranny I am<BR>
imposing on her, in addition to the tyranny of illness. She does not like<BR>
nut flour, and the book does not recommend it when there is D.  She is not<BR>
keen on eggs, and ditto for eggs.  She does not like the taste of the<BR>
yoghurt and besides I have doubts about her tolerance of it. Honey is out<BR>
of the question for her and the only seafood she likes are prawns.<BR>
Sometimes she will have some cheese.  <BR>
Please, tell me what am I supposed to feed my daughter?  <BR>
She has meat and cooked fruit for breakfast, meat or home-made soup for<BR>
lunch, meat and cooked vegetables for dinner. The meat varies - I buy lamb,<BR>
beef, pork, chicken, turkey, organ meats. The fruit these days is mostly<BR>
canned - the labels state it is sugarless. I try to make the evening meals<BR>
as varied as possible but I am terrified she is not having a balanced diet,<BR>
that by these food restrictions I may be contributing to her malnutrition.<BR>
I just need help. I need good advice.  I am so close to giving up, but at<BR>
the same time I am scared of the consequences.<BR>

Dear Cecilia,<BR>
<BR>
I am sorry that I don't have any wondrous advice to give you.  I cried when<BR>
I read your story about your wee one.  I have three young daughters and<BR>
could not imagine your pain. I am on the SCD as well as my young niece. <BR>
She has had a similar history to your daughter in the first year on the<BR>
diet.  She has now been on it for 3 years and her life has turned around. I<BR>
hope that some more time on the diet will heal your daughter.  I wish you<BR>
all the best and will remember you and your daughter in my prayers.<BR>

Its so sad to hear this...with a child. Have you tried avaoiding fruit for a<BR>
few weeks??? All fruits, cant even trust the canned sugarless variety as fruit<BR>
and canned veggies tend to be washed ih a mild food grade detergent when<BR>
processed at the plants(ive worked in one). Also Lamb can be hard to digest<BR>
more than most meats.  Organ meats can be tough too.<BR>
Good luck and dont give up.<BR>

Cecilia, writing as one mother to another, and especially as a mother<BR>
who has also cared for a chronically ill child, I deeply wish I had<BR>
answers for you...<BR>
<BR>
First, if the IV vitamins seem to help, by all means stay with them. <BR>
Perhaps keeping your daughter's vitamin counts up is what will make<BR>
the difference, and help the diet to help her.  Elaine writes that<BR>
everyone on SCD should have a B12 level on the high end of normal in<BR>
order to benefit most, and recommends injections to get it there - so<BR>
even she recognizes that the diet needs a boost sometimes.  Reevaluate<BR>
the situation after you've followed a course of IV vitamins for a<BR>
while - hopefully things will seem more hopeful then.<BR>
<BR>
In the short time I've been on this list, I've come to know you as<BR>
among the most dedicated, knowledgeable, and resourceful practitioners<BR>
of this diet.  If SCD is right for your daughter, I can't imagine<BR>
anyone more qualified to implement it properly and unerringly than you<BR>
have been.  If, after all you've done, you're finding that you need to<BR>
try something else, then at least be at peace with the fact that<BR>
you've certainly done this diet justice.  Any apparent mismatch<BR>
between SCD and your daughter is not your fault.<BR>
<BR>
Elaine herself writes that the diet will not work for everyone.  I<BR>
think most people would agree that not every treatment is right for<BR>
every person.  We are all individuals, and finding the particular path<BR>
that works for each of us is almost always a struggle.<BR>
<BR>
Don't be afraid to strike out on a new path.  Take the same incredible<BR>
energy that you've devoted to SCD, and put it to work on your next<BR>
project (whatever it may be - I wish I had one to suggest to you);<BR>
with your kind of perserverance you're bound to find the best possible<BR>
course for your daughter, sooner or later (please G-d let it be<BR>
sooner).<BR>
<BR>
I wish you and your family only the best.<BR>
<BR>

Cecilia,<BR>
My heart is breaking to hear what your little girl and you are going through.<BR>
Sometimes it is so difficult to find the answer but I know it's there.  You<BR>
just have to keep experimenting and trying different things.  Has she been<BR>
tested for an overgrowth of candida or for parasites.  If so was it at just<BR>
the hospital lab or was it one of the more reputable labs such as the<BR>
Institute of Parasitic Disease or Great Smokies.  The hospital lab did not<BR>
find parasites in my stool specimen but The Institute of Parasitic Disease<BR>
did.  They also found an overgrowth of candida.  I am off of all fruits for 3<BR>
months along with taking a candida purge product.  If I have fruit at all,<BR>
I'm back to square one.  Since I've started dealing with the candida I am<BR>
slowly, finally progressing and able to eat more and gain weight.  Please<BR>
don't give up on the diet, just try eliminating a few things or adding others.<BR>
Does she take any form of acidolphilus?  Please continue to let us help you<BR>
and give you ideas.  And don't hesitate to email me with any questions about<BR>
any of the above. You and your child are in my heart and my prayers.  Love,<BR>
Lois<BR>

Your story is so sad!  There are many things you did not<BR>
say in your long message.  Which disease does your daughter<BR>
have - CD or UC?  How old is she?  How much prednisone does <BR>
she take?  Does she take vitamin supplements?<BR>
<BR>
You seem to be in Australia.  How about trying busesonide <BR>
(sp?), which should be available there?  It is not here in<BR>
the States yet, but supposedly has fewer dangerous side<BR>
effects.  Do you have a GI specialist?<BR>
<BR>
You ask what to feed her, yet rule out so many foods like<BR>
the nut flour, eggs, honey, yogurt, etc.  Most of us find <BR>
ways of making the breads tasty with honey, but you might be <BR>
able to use an artificial sweetener.  What about cheese?<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,  Bart<BR>

Dear Cecilia,<BR>
<BR>
Reading your story was a very moving experience. It his hard not to be<BR>
affected by all that you have written.<BR>
<BR>
To help you out here are some suggestions.<BR>
<BR>
Stress is one of the important factors in IBD. Do not be so hard on<BR>
yourself. You write..  &quot;I am desolated, devastated. I do not know what to<BR>
do. Life is hell. Waking up in the morning is an experience fraught with<BR>
horror. &quot;<BR>
<BR>
You need to calm down in order to help your child.  If there are other<BR>
elements of stress in your life, try to eliminate them. Your child could be<BR>
affected simply by watching your frantic state. You write very well ... so<BR>
even I was affected by your excitement. Take it easy, calm down. My doctor<BR>
gave me Prozac. It helped a great deal. We are most of us under much stress.<BR>
You area not alone in this.<BR>
<BR>
----------<BR>
<BR>
There are many delicious recipes within this diet. Try to take advantage of<BR>
them. There are also some excellent cooks on this list server. They post<BR>
interesting concoctions almost daily. Have you tried some of them.  Do you<BR>
have a copy of Elaine's book . Have you tried most of the recipes in it.<BR>
Have you tried to perk up your meats with onion and garlic and tomatoes and<BR>
spice your meats and vegetables or do you feed her boiled chicken, boiled<BR>
beef, boiled ham, boiled vegetables?  I personally find this diet to be one<BR>
of the easiest to adhere to. I also find it absolutely delicious. I suspect<BR>
that I am not alone in this.<BR>
<BR>
----------------<BR>
<BR>
Continue intravenous vitamin transfusions. She must not be with out<BR>
vitamins.<BR>
<BR>
-----------------<BR>
<BR>
Suspect all canned foods ... including fruits and vegetables. Most of us on<BR>
this list have found many strange ingredients in the weirdest places. Canned<BR>
tuna which I thought was pure turned out to contain vegetable broth and Soya<BR>
protein... sugar pops up in almost all sausages and smoked meats, lactose<BR>
turns up in the pills that I have to take for my gut condition. Apple juice<BR>
proclaimed pure on the label turns out to contain sugar. The hardest part of<BR>
the diet is to ferret out the bad actors in processed foods. I personally<BR>
prefer to start from scratch and use basic materials. I don't trust any<BR>
processed foods at all.<BR>
<BR>
-----------------<BR>
<BR>
You wrote :  &quot;I sometimes wonder if it is just another tyranny I am imposing<BR>
on her........&quot;  --- what other tyrannies are you imposing on her ? If you<BR>
are, don't.<BR>
<BR>
------------------<BR>
<BR>
It took Elaine I think two years to pull her daughter out of her misery.<BR>
This diet is a long term proposition. It works in time, not quickly. And<BR>
there are ups and downs and flare-ups sometimes. So one must have faith and<BR>
a calm mind to stick with it over the long haul.<BR>
<BR>
------------------<BR>
<BR>
Most of all remember that you are not alone in this. Misery loves company,<BR>
and you have a lot of company here on this list and in the world at large.<BR>
<BR>
My prayers are with you.<BR>

Please keep on trying because I know you'll find an answer for her<BR>
eventually. She sounds so brave, and you are a wonderful mother.<BR>
     I do have one idea. Towards the end of your e-mail you were talking<BR>
about what you've been making her for dinner, and you said,  &quot;...the fruit<BR>
these days is mostly canned - the labels state it is sugarless.&quot; According<BR>
to BTVC, labels can be deceiving and some companies do in fact add sugar and<BR>
starches without listing these products in the ingredients list. Maybe<BR>
staying away from ALL canned foods (even fruit that appears to be okay) will<BR>
be one tiny, healthful step in the right direction for her.<BR>
    I hope this helps, and my prayers are with you.<BR>

Dear Cecilia, <BR>
<BR>
As a mother with a daughter who has CD my heart went out to you when I read<BR>
your letter. Our children are so patient, good and trust us to know what is<BR>
best for them. <BR>
<BR>
My daughter has not been on the SCD as long as yours and she is still<BR>
taking medication so I don't feel very qualified to answer your questions.<BR>
Lara has been doing well and her energy levels have been astounding,<BR>
especially given how sick she was this spring during her 5 weeks at the<BR>
hospital. She also is taking supplements and I wonder if some of these have<BR>
helped. I'll just mention a few, in case you haven't considered them (the<BR>
descriptions come from Balch &amp; Balch &quot;Prescription for Nutritional Healing&quot;):<BR>
<BR>
NAG - N-Acetyglucosamine - A major constituent of the barrier layer that<BR>
protects the intestinal lining from the digestive enzymes and other<BR>
potentially damaging intestinal contents.<BR>
<BR>
Omega 3  (she takes flaxseed oil in the morning &amp; salmon oil at night) -<BR>
needed for repair of the digestive tract; reduces inflammatory processes...<BR>
<BR>
L-Glutamine - A major metabolic fuel for the intestinal cells; maintains<BR>
the villi, the absorption surfaces of the gut.<BR>
<BR>
Pantothenic Acid (vitamin B5) - ...helps to convert fats, carbohydrates,<BR>
and proteins into energy. It is required by all cells in the body and is<BR>
concentrated in the organs...prevents certain form of anemia. It is needed<BR>
for normal fuctioning of the gastrointestinal tract...<BR>
<BR>
Quercetin - slows histamine release; helps control food allergies. Needed<BR>
for a variety of enzyme funcitons. <BR>
<BR>
You may know about these already - I'm no expert &amp; it has been a bit of a<BR>
hit or miss (with some guidance from a naturopath). <BR>
<BR>
I recently spoke to someone who has a 16 year old with Crohns &amp; has been<BR>
symptom free for 4 years, taking only asacol. They have imposed some<BR>
dietary restrictions but she attributes part of her daughter's recovery to<BR>
reflexology. I'm thinking of looking into this as well.<BR>
<BR>
I understand that each case is different &amp; to some extent we have to adjust<BR>
the way the disease is treated. <BR>

I wish you luck and courage.<BR>

Hi Cecilia,<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; I haven't been regularly reading the posts from this list. We have been<BR>
&gt; struggling.  I can tell you, I am close to giving up on the SCD.<BR>
</font><BR>
Please don't give up on the SCD!  The SCD is not the ONLY thing needed to heal<BR>
severe cases, but your daughter will never be well if she goes back to a<BR>
typical western diet!<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt;  She has been on cortisone for 13<BR>
&gt; months out of the last 15.  This is so bad for her little body, I cannot<BR>
&gt; bear to contemplate it.<BR>
</font><BR>
I'm so very sorry to hear this; it is dreadful for her :-(...<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; What's more, the doctor recently tested her blood and all the readings for<BR>
&gt; vitamins, minerals and amino acids came up dangerously low.  The doctor was<BR>
&gt; shocked and immediately ordered intravenous vitamin transfusions.<BR>
</font><BR>
Thank heavens your doctor thought to do this!  Even with the diet, many people<BR>
can't heal unless they take supplemental nutrients, and many of us are so<BR>
damaged we just can't absorb nutrients from food or pills.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; The<BR>
&gt; result immediately after the first transfusion was amazing.  My daughter<BR>
&gt; actually started to laugh and speak, and her cheeks were pink for the first<BR>
&gt; time in months.  She has not been absorbing any goodness for months.  All<BR>
&gt; the supplements I give her are not doing her any good.  How can she heal if<BR>
&gt; she is not being nourished?  She had the vitamin levels of a famine victim.<BR>
&gt; If you could see this child you would know why I am crying and dying<BR>
&gt; inside.<BR>
</font><BR>
What you have to do, is be encouraged, and not give up!! You have found the<BR>
answer -- your daughter needs IV vitamins and the SCD, not just one or the<BR>
other.  If you can persuade your little girl's doctor (and he sounds like a<BR>
reasonable man) to give her really large (mega even) doses of B12 and folic<BR>
acid, plus extra B6 in addition to everything else he has given her, and if you<BR>
can persuade him to keep it up, and not stop the IV vitamins at the first sign<BR>
of improvement, you will be amazed at the results.  Folic acid especially (in<BR>
amazingly large doses, sometimes) is needed to heal the gut, and prednisone<BR>
depletes it.  An injured gut will not absorb nutrients, and in addition,<BR>
chronic diarrhea depletes nutrients at an alarming rate (make sure he gives her<BR>
calcium and magnesium -- magnesium is likely to be especially deficient, and<BR>
she needs calcium plus Vitamin D for her bones after having taken cortisone for<BR>
so long).<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; She is as sweet as an angel.  She does not complain, but eats and<BR>
&gt; drinks all the strange concoctions set before her, and tries to smile and<BR>
&gt; says she will be better soon. She is the dearest little thing who just<BR>
&gt; wants to be well enough to play with her friends and go to school to learn<BR>
&gt; about plants and animals, so she can be a botanist or a vet. She has never<BR>
&gt; hurt anything or anyone and sometimes I just cannot believe that such a<BR>
&gt; thing could happen to such a dear, darling person.<BR>
</font><BR>
<BR>
Your daughter does indeed sound like an angel ;-), and I'm sure she'll be a<BR>
healthy angel, one of these days.  But it will take time and dedication, which<BR>
you obviously have, and continuing the IV nutrients in addition to the SCD.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; So after ten months on the SCD we are back to square one. I had such hope<BR>
&gt; and faith.  But what do I do?  I feel like giving up on the diet but what<BR>
&gt; choice do I have?<BR>
&gt; My daughter is only eating meats, cooked fruits and cooked vegetables. This<BR>
&gt; is SO LIMITING.<BR>
</font><BR>
Well, yes it is limiting, but try cooking the fruits yourself instead of using<BR>
canned ones.  If you microwave cut up fruit uncovered in a bowl until very soft<BR>
it will taste delicious, totally unlike canned!  Even though summer's over,<BR>
apples and pears are available all year around in qualities that are perfectly<BR>
fine for cooking.  Try adding butter and salt to well cooked (but not boiled)<BR>
vegetables, and if your daughter likes it and can tolerate it, some onion (well<BR>
saut=E9ed until very soft and somewhat browned), shallots, garlic and or ginger<BR>
(last two very well chopped and saut=E9ed in butter).  If you use Keller's<BR>
European Style Butter (also sold as Plugra) which is by Hotel Bar Butter and is<BR>
unsalted, it will make everything taste better.  Try to get really good quality<BR>
meat, no easy task these days!  Your daughter is probably very sensitive to an<BR>
overload of bacteria in meat and can easily get food poisoning (that can be<BR>
mistaken for intolerance of all sorts of foods) from meat that isn't very<BR>
fresh; this can set her back and irritate her gut for weeks.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt;  She is not<BR>
&gt; keen on eggs, and ditto for eggs.<BR>
</font><BR>
See if you can get eggs freshly laid (perhaps someone nearby keeps chickens?)<BR>
and see if she likes really really fresh eggs made into an omelet cooked with<BR>
good quality butter.  I always hated eggs, but didn't realize until I tasted<BR>
fresh ones, that what I hated was old, spoiled eggs, the only kind one can find<BR>
in the supermarket.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; She does not like the taste of the<BR>
&gt; yoghurt and besides I have doubts about her tolerance of it.<BR>
</font><BR>
Do you make it in either a Yogourmet II or in an oven with a light bulb?  Most<BR>
yogurt makers keep the yogurt at too high a temperature (the Yogourmet solves<BR>
that problem by keeping the container in a water bath), and the resulting<BR>
product tastes terribly sour.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; Honey is out<BR>
&gt; of the question for her and the only seafood she likes are prawns.<BR>
&gt; Sometimes she will have some cheese.<BR>
&gt; Please, tell me what am I supposed to feed my daughter?<BR>
&gt; She has meat and cooked fruit for breakfast, meat or home-made soup for<BR>
&gt; lunch, meat and cooked vegetables for dinner. The meat varies - I buy lamb,<BR>
&gt; beef, pork, chicken, turkey, organ meats. The fruit these days is mostly<BR>
&gt; canned - the labels state it is sugarless. I try to make the evening meals<BR>
&gt; as varied as possible but I am terrified she is not having a balanced diet,<BR>
&gt; that by these food restrictions I may be contributing to her malnutrition.<BR>
</font><BR>
This is actually a very nutritious diet (meat, veggies and fruits -- will be<BR>
better when a few nuts can be added), just a bit boring, unfortunately.  You<BR>
are absolutely not contributing to her being malnourished!  That is caused by<BR>
having a disease that irritates and injures the gut to the extent that<BR>
nutrients are not absorbed!  Then drugs which exacerbate the deficiencies are<BR>
taken for the disease , and the condition worsens.  It's a real vicious cycle,<BR>
as the title of Elaine Gottschall's book says, resulting in a downward spiral.<BR>
This can be reversed with IV nutrients (especially large quantities of folic<BR>
acid to heal the gut, and others which are particularly deficient in UC and CD<BR>
patients) over a long period of time, and strictly adhering to the diet.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
&gt; I just need help. I need good advice.  I am so close to giving up, but at<BR>
&gt; the same time I am scared of the consequences.<BR>
</font><BR>
If these things do not help, then you probably have to investigate the<BR>
possibility of parasites, and I would certainly have your daughter checked for<BR>
candida overgrowth, which is practically inevitable after taking cortisone.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck!!<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

I send my deepest prayers to you and your daughter. There is a profound<BR>
connection between us all, and I know that there is great power in the love<BR>
that binds the hearts gathered here. Please know there is immeasurable<BR>
power in love and heartfelt prayers... and that your daughter can make a<BR>
turnaround, even when the evidence supports the view that she is declining.<BR>
There is little room for doubt in your experience; it is self-defeating.<BR>
Keep your focus on her continued improvement, as we all will, and keep your<BR>
heart open to the possibility that it may well be something simple, like<BR>
the fruit, that is causing the decline. <BR>
<BR>
Trust your instincts. You are extremely fortunate that your beautiful<BR>
daughter is cooperative with the diet. Experiment by cutting out the foods<BR>
you believe are suspect for a week or so. And watch for the small signs of<BR>
improvement that tell you which foods are the right foods for her now.<BR>
Simplify her diet, especially while she is on the IV vitamins, to reduce<BR>
the stress on her digestive tract. Soup and vegetables are soothing,<BR>
healing, nourishing foods. Keep her off anything that you are unsure about.<BR>
Remember, this is a temporary setback. <BR>
<BR>
As with my son, I believe your daughter is indeed an angel, teaching us<BR>
about the vast power of the human spirit. Never underestimate the power of<BR>
your focused intentions imbued with love. <BR>

I know you've gotten lots of advice but here's another bit. <BR>
Theoretically, supplements are good but some bother some people.  The<BR>
hard pressed ones in particular irritate my husband's insides and leave<BR>
in approximately the same form they entered.  You might consider<BR>
eliminating all supplements for a few days (I believe most allergy books<BR>
say four days to eliminate something from the body) and then add then<BR>
one by one.  Just a thought.  Your daughter doesn't seem to be deriving<BR>
benefit from them anyway so if one if irritating her. . .<BR>

Dear Cecilia,<BR>
Have you tried the fresh vegetable juices? Elaine says they are OK to<BR>
have even when D is a problem. If your daughter did so well with the<BR>
vitamin infusion, it seems the fresh juices might help. A sweet, mild<BR>
juice I like is:<BR>
A couple of carrots, 1/4 beet  (raw), 1/2 cucumber, 1/2 stalk celery. <BR>
A good juicing book is The Juiceman's Power of Juicing, by Jay Kordich. <BR>
I've tried many <BR>
combinations from his book that I have liked. <BR>
When I used to get gastritis attacks, the ONLY thing that got my stomach<BR>
lining to heal was carrot, cabbage and celery juice.<BR>
One last tip. If your juicer doesn't make a perfectly smooth juice, I<BR>
would recommend straining it. I have an Acme and a Champion. The Acme<BR>
makes a juice as smooth as milk, which I really like. The Champion lets a<BR>
certain amount of roughage through which I feel has a disagreeabe flavor<BR>
and texture.<BR>
I know you said she doesn't like yogurt, but have you tried it made with<BR>
the 1/2 and 1/2? It has such a great texture and is so sweet. <BR>
Do keep us posted, and we'll hope the infusions help get her back on<BR>
track.<BR>

<P>For what it's worth, I couldn't tolerate Asacol and I tolerate sulfasalazine
just fine-up to the max dosage as a matter of fact.  But everyone is
different, and sulfa is a big allergen for a lot of people.  They started me
VERY slowly on it at first.  And as for the diet, I had been on it since Jan.
1 and got so sick sulfasalazine wasn't enough anymore, and had to start
Prednisone, which I am now trying to reduce.  I stopped the diet Sat. and feel
better today than I have this entire year on the diet.  I am very disheartened
because I was convinced that the diet was going to be my miracle cure and I
was fanatical about it. But I felt I had to stop it to continue my Prednisone
weaning, and couldn't while still on the diet.  I don't know what, if
anything, I was doing wrong, but I also had lost 10 pounds that I could ill
afford to lose.  And just when I announced I was going to stop the diet, the
mail came and my mom surprised me with an arrival of nut flour!   And she
bought me a yogurt maker too!  I don't want to give up, just atleast get back
to baseline.  There is a Crohn's Symposium being put on here Sat. and I am
going and will ask them about what they think about SCD-but then these are
MDs, so we probably can guess what they will say.

To: SCD-list@longisland.com<BR> 
Subject: <B>scientific data for SCD</B><BR> 
<P>Okay, I've been reading all the great posts about getting some science
(and some will power)  for the diet and doing something about getting the
medical community to accept the SCD. I haven't finished reading all the
posts but I have to say my bit about the scientific study of the SCD.
Please don't flame me if I'm off track or too serious, just gently tell me
to stay out of it! ;) This is a long email so for those of you that aren't
prepared to read the entire thing, quit now.
<P>First let me start off by saying ALL ideas are great and some of them,
like raising money and awareness of the SCD would certainly raise
eye-brows about the diet's potential and might get us &quot;noticed.&quot; I have
been thinking for A VERY LONG TIME that real scientific research should be
conducted on the SCD, but I am only ONE research scientist (post-doctoral
fellow at the moment) and a team is needed to undertake such an important
study.

<P>All of our GI's say &quot;there is no scientific proof for the diet.&quot; We
have
no ammunition against this comment - no large scale studies etc... so it
is pretty much true! There is only anecdotal evidence- which is good but you 
can't get anyone to believe you just because you say &quot;I swear it
works...it has helped person a, b and c. So thus far, the docs are right. 

<P>I'm pretty sure that there have been many GI's or basic researchers that
have tried to study diet and IBD and are still at this very moment running
studies on diet and IBD. Perhaps not specifically the SCD but if you read
Dr. Lutz's book (I think parts of it have been put on the scd-web site),
you'll see that there has been some science done on diet. However, there
are a number of HUGE challenges to conducting a study on diet. To say the
least, one would need to help of nutritionists, chemists and yes GI docs
to run an appropriate and scientific study (oh ya and researchers
like me ;-))

<P>So, having said this, let me tell you about a few of the *extremely
important* issues that I have thought about while reading these emails and
thinking SERIOUSLY about running a study about the SCD. Man, how I'd love
to get real data on this diet and PUBLISH it! I think it's possible but
will be VERY hard to do b/c of opposition and the science/medicine
knowledge required....

<P>As I said, don't think that IBD researchers and GI's haven't tried
studying diet before. Many GI's at one point, I'm sure, want to put some
merit in diet but have truly failed to find results for any  number
of reasons. For example, there are very few patients that stick to any
sort of serious diet (just like some aren't compliant with meds) and as we
all know from this list, even we all have trouble. An important
question for a study on the SCD and IBD would be &quot;how will we know whether
a person in the study is compliant (like us) with the diet.&quot;

<P>I'm sure one way around it is to have people that are on this list and
committed to the diet be the study participants, but this too takes away a
bit from the true science of such a study (although I can make the
arguement that we are probaly the best people to use...). So, in order to
make any attempt at empirically testing the diet is to have people stay on
it 10000000% for as long as the study goes on it without quitting. VERY
tough. 

<P>Another research issue that GI's are frequently concerned about with a
study on diet and IBD is a CONTROL group. By a control group (i'm
sure you all know what this is but just humour me) I mean a group of
people NOT on any diet. Perhaps it is also important to have another group
of people on a modified diet. These people are matched in age and
symptoms and duration/severity of disease. This is typically how clincial
studies are done (i.e. with meds) where you have the ability to make
COMPARISONS between the groups about relapse rate, progress, reduction of
symptoms both subjective and upon medical examination....blah blah blah...

<P>Another question is: How do we control for things like the type of meds
people are on or off or going on and off... 

<P>Yet another point: We NEED clinical data from scopes and blood work and
all that stuff that only GI&quot;s can provide if we are going to talk about
this diet helping... subjective comments about decreased BM and pain are
helpful but the medical community doesn't go for that stuff exclusively.

<P>Anyway, I can go on very seriously on this topic for a while because there
are SOOOOOOO many study issues that arise if one wants to get something
important like this done.

<P>Also, we would for sure have to recruit a GI doc for the study as there
HAS to be some kind of medical supervison of patients (I think).

<P>Sorry if you think I'm against this BUT I&quot;M NOT!!! I want this research
to
be done but we can't do it alone. I just wanted to point out some of
the issues that are involved in research like this (and of this
importance). If we can organize a group of professionals I'll GLADLY BE
INVOLVED IN THE STUDY!!

<P>Thank you for listening to my ranting....

<P>Respectfully,
Marla (UC, Toronto)

Subject: <B>Re: What's up</B><BR>
<P>A thought:  CCFA's latest newsletter, Focus, had an article that said that
food MAY have a bearing on CD and that it was worth a try.  SCD was
mentioned as being popular; the article said that any structured diets have
the drawback of causing people to lose weight.  This list gives many stories
of people losing weight initially, then gaining the proper amount.
<P>A couple of people have mentioned that vitamin B5 helped them wean off of
Pred.  As far as the diabetes goes, all I can suggest is that you leave the
honey, dried fruit, juice, and other really sweet things out and exercise
daily (a walk is fine) until you get off insulin.  Maybe you even need to
cut out fat for awhile - I'm not sure about that.
<P>We just had a rousing discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of  'scopys.'
Some felt worse, others felt better afterwards.
