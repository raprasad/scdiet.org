&gt;Hi Dale,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;My daughter had surgery as well. A combination of surgery and<BR>
&gt;one year ( no cheating ) on the diet solved her problem.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Good luck<BR>

Hello Benny,<BR><BR>

It was so incouraging to read your reply to Dale. I usually lurk here
without posting because I am not an IBD patient. We are on the diet because
of our son who was diagnossed earlier this year. The whole reason we went
this way was because it presented us with a glimmer of hope, whereas the
doctors were just offering up prednisone, azulfidine, and eventually,
surgery. He was diagnossed early, so if the diet does what I expect it to
do for him, we will never have to deal with the surgery. He is taking fish
oil instead of sulfasalazine, and he was put on prednisone when he was
first diagnossed. I don't want him on that stuff again if there is any way
to avoid it! Matt has been on the diet for about a month and so far,
everything is going great. He doesn't even want to cheat because he is
hoping that things will normalize for him after he has followed the diet
for a couple of years or so, and he will be able to eat some of the foods
he has given up. I don't know if it will work out that way or not, but that
hope keeps him on the straight and narrow. I wanted to ask you about your
daughter. How long has it been since the end of her year on the SCD,and
does she still follow the diet?<BR><BR>

Thanks for the encouragement,<BR>
Steve<BR>

Hi ALL!<BR>
        It's been a while since I wrote-busy- studying, working, and<BR>
mothering!  I very happy to report on Melissa's progress(she's an active 16<BR>
yr.old with U.C.). She's been on the diet STRICTLY for 1 1/2 years and has<BR>
been off prednisone for 3 months now. Her weaning off the drug was very<BR>
slow- she seemed to react with severe headaches and feeling of illness each<BR>
time she lowered the dosage. I feel such a weight has been lifted with the<BR>
elimination of the pred.! <BR>
        Our former doctor went to greener pastures in the U.S. so on our<BR>
recent visit to our new GP I outlined the diet and she seemed receptive to<BR>
it. She did send Melissa for blood work as she hadn't any testing since<BR>
hospitalization 2 yrs.ago.<BR>
        Melissa has gained weight- is 5'9&quot;, playing soccer this summer and <BR>
working out at the local 'Y'. She has one solid mov't/day- life is<BR>
wonderful!  There is NO DOUBT in both my and my husband's mind that this<BR>
diet has and is the reason Melissa is doing so well. She has agreed to<BR>
remain on it for one more year and then, depending on how all is , might<BR>
attempt re-introducing other foods. She is quite used to the diet as a way<BR>
of life- yes there are definitely times when she's with her friends and the<BR>
appeal of other foods is strong-more for social reasons. Thinking back to<BR>
her 2 wks on TPN  and the life she had prior to hospitalization puts the<BR>
diet in a great light.<BR>
        To all those considering the diet- it is certainly worth the<BR>
attempt- at least for 2 months. This is a long- term treatment -patience and<BR>
STRICT adherence to it are required. She stayed on prednisone for over 1<BR>
yr.all the while continuing with the diet. With her it was very evident<BR>
right from the start that she responded in a positve way to the diet.<BR>
        Continued good luck to all!<BR>
Cathy in N.S. Canada- a very happy mother-now going to put on another batch<BR>
of yogurt!!!!<BR>
