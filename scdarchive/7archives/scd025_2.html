Actually, it's interesting that she seems on the one hand to abhore
censorship on the internet and on the other hand wants to limit the
discussion on the web page and this list.<BR><BR>

Re: Elaine's Fax:<BR><BR>

The SCD list is not open to debate? Hmmmm...where have I heard an attitude like
that before?  Maybe countless Drs. who considered their own brand of treatment
not &quot;open to debate&quot;.  Give me a break. I am beginning to think that her lack of
credibility in the scientific/medical community is not her theories, but her
unwillingness to consider that there may be more to this than meets the eye,
that even SHE does not have all the answers and that the whole IBD issue/mystery
is just beginning to be unraveled.<BR><BR>

I want to thank everyone who has supported me in the past...wish everyone luck
in their pursuit of health and I will continue to encourage others to try the
SCD when I get a chance.  But this was the last straw.  Consider me

Hi all,<BR>
Is it only me to notice that those upset by Elaine's fax &amp; all that's
transpired in recent days, have been those that aren't on the diet? Its
true that those people &quot;saved&quot; by the diet are bulldoggish in their defense
of it, but how could it be otherwise? If after years of intense bleeding
and suffering and literally dying, one finds a miracle (and what I've foud
in this diet is no less), how is it possible to react differently to a
disection and a questioning of it's potential? So for those disbeleivers
who are having a problem with the recent exchanges I say, try it, you'll
see what it is about the SCD that inspires such fanatical praise and
adherence.<BR>
Peace &amp; love to all,<BR>

Well.. it saddens me to see so much arguing going on in this list.  I

you have offered.  But I live with too much in my life to put up with
all of this bickering.  I hope you all have a happy and safe life..  But
I'm going to unsubscribe to this list.  I can find better support
elsewhere.<BR><BR>

Elaine.. Keep up the good work.  I think your excellent.  And I'm sure
this diet will help thousands of people.<BR><BR>

If y'all could please do me one last favor and tell me how to

I understand why people get upset with Elaine.  I talked to her once on the
phone and she came off as being very snippy, almost elitest.  She couldn't
understand that this diet isn't easy for a lot of people.  We are human
after all.  To give up all the foods you love cold turkey isn't easy.  The
diet is so beneficial.  I am just hoping that her attitude doesn't keep
people away from her diet.  Everyone needs to loosen up a bit.  <BR><BR>

Dear Laurie,<BR>
Elaine has talked to literally thousands of people on the phone. She does
this because she wants to help. I do know for a fact that she would rather
not have people calling asking her questions that are clearly answered in
the book. She was very helpful when I would call with a question. In fact I
remember the first time I called her, when I offered to pay her for her
time, she didn't want me to pay her and she said to call any time I has a
question.<BR>
She is the furthest thing from an elitist. I have spent time with her, she
has a great sense of humor and is VERY down to earth.
I hate to hear her being criticized, when I know that thanks to her efforts
many people have regained their health who otherwise wouldn't have,
including of course myself and hopefully soon your husband's as well.<BR>

Subject: <B>Ellaine's reaction</B><BR><BR>

Hi everybody.<BR><BR>

I have felt a sort of sadness since I read all that noice on the IBDList and
the fax from Ellaine Gottscahll indeed made it worse. First let my tell you
that I don't follow SCD but my own diet. They are not totally different. I
am also thinking about weather or not recommend the SCD to others here i
Norway.
<BR><BR>
For some people following the diet 100% will do the job. Nice, they don't
have to think, just follow the recipies. But for others I think SCD must be
modified due to food intolerance for instans. (I cannot eat carrots.) I
believe that this list should also be for them. Here they can discuss their
problems and find a way. Because IBD is higly induvidual. And when the diet
does not work quite satisfactory they have to make their own experiences and
make adjustments. This must of course be their own responsibility. That is
how I work all the time. Now the question I would like to ask is: Should
people like me stay away from SCDList and be left alone in the dark trying
to find something that works for them?<BR><BR>

Odd Oivind<BR><BR>

PS. I sendt a mail about making a trail on SCD. So far no responce... DS.

Subject: <B>Re: Elaine's Fax/Dare I Say It...</B><BR><BR>

Hi April,<BR><BR>

I was sorry to hear you are planning to leave the list. I always
appreciated your posts.  I just wanted to let you know that you're not
the only one who feels the way you do.  It is strange to me that Elaine
relies so rigidly on Dr. Haas' original diet when it seems obvious that
after thirty years or whatever, certain things could be figured out.
For example, I know that when her daughter went on the diet they
probably didn't have the &quot;health food products&quot; around that we do now --
where you can get canned goods (like Hain) that don't have ingredients
other than what is listed.  Since I got to a certain level of health, I
feel like I can follow the diet rigidly and still try a canned good here
or there, take acidopholous instead of yogurt, etc.  Meaning,
experiment.  Geez, I hate it when health professionals treat you like
you can't think or make a decision for yourself.<BR><BR>

But most of all, I find an amazing similarity between Elaine's rigidity
and Dr. Hollands.  They are just from different camps.  I used to work
in politics and got used to the dynamic.  Personally, I feel like it's
more about personality style than science.  I am so happy to have the
diet and do respect Elaine for putting her books out.  But the fact is
that there is much scientific research that can be done to back up
Elaine's diet that isn't even talked about.  For example, the diet sets
out to reballance the bacterial flora of the gut.  Depending on which
particular bad bacteria are growing, sometimes antibiotics can be used
appropriately to help get rid of the bad bacteria, take the load off the
body.  I speak from personal experience.  I had a Klebsiella and
Citrobacter(at least the Klebsiella is a carb-eating bacteria, not sure
about the Citrobacter) overgrowth a few years ago and my health bounced
up 50% from taking a course of antibiotics.  Meaning I was able to
digest food again.<BR><BR>

Well, anyway, I just wanted to say, do what you need to do.  But I'm
glad you wrote in and I hope you decide to stay or come back one day.<BR><BR>

Hey, I don't understand why everyone is getting so uppity?  If people in
the group want to take things the wrong way, then I think you are just to
touchy.  Elaine Gottschall has helped many people and she has helped me
with my suffering of Crohn's.  I think this has all started from the IBD
group and that other doctor whatever his name is?  I am not really
interested in other peoples opinions and on how someone else's personality
is.  Like it says in the bible &quot;Let the first person with no sins cast the
first stone&quot;  I am not the most religious person, but there is some truth
to that.  This list is the second best thing that happened for me.  The
first thing was the book SCD and then this group.  I think that everyone
with our disorder (IBD) should relax and not get stressed out.  If you
don't like the posting that people from the group put on there is this
little button that I have on my computer is called DELETE, I think everyone
with a computer has one.  Well to each is own.

&gt;It just seems that at the moment the timing may be bad.<BR>
&gt;Seems like the list is not in the best state of morale.<BR><BR>
</FONT>
Why is everyone getting so worried? Please, won't you read some of the
testimonials at the SCD Web Library or elsewhere if you have forgotten that
this Specific Carbohydrate Diet has helped thousands of people.
I happen to be one of them, now one year on the diet.<BR>
I feel the diet has saved my life, and honestly, no message or discussion from
this list - no matter how negative or irritating - could ever make me think of
leaving the diet. Nor quitting the mailing list.<BR><BR>

I think it is interesting when the debate gets heated,  and if the price we
have to pay for the freedom of speech is that the argument gets a little
overheated and turns into an argument once every half year (it's happened
before on this list, you know, as well as on many other lists), then I'd say:
It's worth it!<BR>
Anyway, things have quieted down now and I think everyone involved is back to
the old, VERY positive energies of this list.<BR>
Let's give up discussing whether Elaine Gottschall (and others involved in the
previous debate) is a &quot;this&quot; or a &quot;that&quot; person, let's put our focus on this
diet of hers that apparently keeps on saving people's intestines all over the
globe.<BR><BR>

Yours,<BR>

First, Ellen , I'm sorry if I was prying, but I'm hoping that you have a
good break, and when you do &quot; get with the program&quot;, you find it to be as
beneficial for you  as it has for myself and others. It reall y is not that
much work. It's just a matter of avuding stuff and making sure you eat a
balanced diet too. It does help to have a kitche and be able to get to the
food store, I must admit.<BR><BR>


AS far as all the griping goes, who cares? The diet works as all who are on
it know. So what's the big deal if a few people want to over
intillectualise (sp?) every thing? I don't get it.<BR><BR>

Ther are so many testimonials to its good effects, and nothing works for
everybody all the time. I think if you just work out what foods are good
and avoid those that seem to work against you, things will be fine. I never
got the impression that Elaine was preaching some kind of gospel that had
to be followed to the letter. Maybe that was just my take. I read the book
and said &quot;WOW this is  for me!&quot; and after some time everything just got
better and better. It didn't happen overnight. This isn't prescription
medicine. I believe that she did say that something that has taken years to
became so fouled up intestinally, will take time to get straightened out.
BTW, I stopped all medication when I started the diet and maybe it has
taken a little longer to work, but it did.<BR><BR>

So stick with it-100 percent is best, and I hope you will see the same
results a lot of us have seen. Personally, you couldn't get me to eat a
bowl of cereal  for anything. But boy, that 1/2 and 1/2! I don't understand
why so many people seem to be having trouble with the yogurt making. Maybe
I've been lucky, but I've just followed the basic rules, and it's come out
perfect every time. I do like the Yogourmet.<BR><BR>


And Mik, I agree. Let's get back to the diet and all its worth, and let's
skip the criticism . maybe the diet won't work if you don't want it to .
How can it if you're sceptical and not commited ?<BR>

Subject: <B>April in August</B><BR><BR>

Now that she's gone, we can talk about her behind her back too!  Why
don't we express our opinions about what we &quot;think&quot; her agenda is, like
she does about Elaine.  It just seems strange to me that, amongst all
the evidence that the SCD works, among us who are actually aflicted with
this scourge, that the &quot;mother&quot; of the diet would be the target of
attacks by individuals who were helped by the diet.  It kind of reminds
me of this guy a couple of 1000 years ago. Everyone loved his ideas,
except for the establishment, until, suddenly, WHAM! everyone wanted to
crucify him.<BR><BR>

It appears to me that someone started a listserver for the SCD, and when
that crashed, (or whatever the hell happened to the old one) a new one
was created (thank you for whoever - Mik? - put in all the time and
effort) but the new one dosen't seem to be specifically the SCD -
there's an awful lot of other navel-gazing biological mumbo-jumbo that I
try to make sense out of, but none of it has made any difference in my
life, except use up my valuable time (like yours is being used up right
now reading this ridiculous post when you could be discovering a new
delicious recipe or, if you are starting out on the diet, how to &quot;go
easy&quot; in the beginning). There are still the occasional constructive
postings that relate to the diet that I have found works for me.  This
is what keeps me here. The rest is like commercials on TV, inevitabe
distraction.<BR><BR>

Maybe those who are following Elaine's diet or interested in it should
have a separate listserver exclusively for the SCD.  I see no fault with
professionals and enthusiasts of microbiology, intestinal disorders and
the like having a forum to discuss and debate new technologies, theories
and ideas.  It just seems that it confuses regular people like me who
have found something that works and want to share thier experience.
Unfortunately, I am computer illeterate, and stretched for time, so I
can't create a separate listserver just yet.  But if the discoverer of
the the diet as a sucessful treatment for UC and Chrons is sending us a
warning that the listserver isn't serving its constituents properly, I
feel this is a warning that should be heeded (call it intuition).<BR><BR>

PS re antibiotics - They aren't very good for you in the long run.  You
build up a resistance, needing more and more and they wear on your
immune system, so I am told.  The SCD diet won't do this to you.<BR><BR>

I agree. I find that some people are defending the diet with an
almost unhealthy fanatical zeal. As someone once posted &quot;Elaine is
not a goddess&quot;. If people want to modify the diet slightly to better
suit themselves and can stay healthy doing so, why not? Some of the
venom in the posts is very disturbing, including Elaine's fax.<BR><BR>

Subject: <B>list in an uproar</B><BR><BR>

Everyone,<BR>
Lately this &quot;new&quot; SCD list has been going downhill due to all the negativity,
bickering, and arguing.  I admit to being guilty of participation in this
myself because I flamed dr. holland on the ibdlist.  I think there was a
re-bound effect back to this list because of it, and it was a big mistake.  I
should have ignored him, and from now on I will.  This whole thing has made me
realize that if someone is not open to the diet, there is no point wasting
energy on trying to convince them.  Debate is one thing, but I think what has
been happening lately is not exactly debate.  The tone of many recent posts has
been less than curteous and kind.  I would like to make a motion that we all
agree to be kind to one another, leave out the criticism, and concentrate on
the SCD.  I just re-read two chapters of the book last night, and it was like a
re-birth of enthusiasm and understanding.  I highly recommend re-reading parts
to refresh your memory and understanding.<BR><BR>

This list has definately changed since we've had the new owners, and it seems,
not for the better unfortunately.  We are driving people away with this style
of a list and if it continues we will have nothing left.  This list should be
for support mainly.  We don't need to restrict or power-trip.  If everyone uses
common sense, I think we can get back to the harmonious, positive, loving
environment that we used to have on this list.  I think many of the original
members agree with me on this perception of how our list used to be.  I am very
fond of this list and would hate to see it fall by the wayside.  I have already
had to write to someone to ask them not to leave the list because it's just
going through a bad patch at the moment.  Let's correct the situation so we
don't scare even more new people away that we could have helped.  I hope I can
depend on all of your support.  Thanks for listening,<BR>

Now, I just want to say something about the quarral on the list lately. In
the first place I encoraged Don Wiss to critizise the diet, so you are not
alone. But what is the use of discussing the snow that melted yesterday? You

A friend of mine found that SCD didn't work for him. So he called Elaine who
told him something like that &quot;if the diet doesn't work within the first
three-four weeks, then it is probably because you belong the those app. 25
percent to whom the diet does NOT work.&quot;<BR>

<BR></FONT>

This mailing list most certainly IS for people exclusively on the SCD.<BR>
At least that is as far as I have understood it.<BR>
But obviously, you can't avoid that others will &quot;lurk&quot; - and once in a while
speak up.<BR>
That's the nature of a mailing list.<BR>
Unless we'd go back to the good old days when we sent &quot;exclusive&quot; letters to
the &quot;members&quot; which we all had on a carboncopy-list in our mailboxes.
I would not recommend that.<BR>
This listserver works better than ever, from a technical point of view, with
these new archives where anybody can log in and read recent as well as old
mail.<BR>
In other words, if you are far away from home and from your emailbox, as long
as you can get to some kind of an online www-computer, you can always check out
how the correspondence of the list is doing.
I've come to appreciate that feature.<BR>
<BR>

And now to something completely different...    The SCD.   &nbsp; &nbsp;   ;-)<BR>

I would like to ask all list participants to stay away from the subjects which have
stirred controversy recently.<BR><BR>

We should remember that our purpose is to help each other.  That is made much more
difficult when we have as many distractions as we have had lately.<BR><BR>

I would like to request avoiding personal attacks of any kind.  Send private email to
those when the subject of discussion is not for the whole group.<BR><BR>

you're right Glenn...i think we should all remember that...and we should
also
remember that divergent thinking is a good thing...not always agreeing is a
good
thing...let's just try not to attack the individual...attack the actions
not the personality...
we've learned a lot from this list and other lists....i get so sad when
someone closes
the door and walks away...it diminishes us all.<BR><BR>

Correct. No one has been, or will be deleted from the Maelstrom list.<BR>
People will have to signoff themselves (or e-mail me) if they don't want to<BR>
be on it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The buttom line is that it certainly is important that noone feels that they<BR>
&gt;could come in a situation where they'd be &quot;bumped out&quot; of a list because of<BR>
&gt;their viewpoints. <BR>
&gt;Freedom of speech is essential. <BR>
&gt;Even if it is just a _feeling_ of freedom of speech.<BR>

But Rachel bumped me off the new list for my viewpoints. She subscribed<BR>
every single person to the new list but me. Do remember that she once posted:<BR>

<BR>
   Dear All,<BR>
                  Just a quick note to thank you for remaining an open<BR>
forum that discusses all options . It never ceases to amaze me that people<BR>
can be so closed minded and think one way is the only way. As many know the<BR>
SCD diet helped me immensely , but I am one of those that cannot eat yogurt<BR>
and therefore I guess that makes me a rebel.<BR>
        It is almost funny if you think of it that after dealing with doctors that<BR>
believed in only one way for all  (drugs) that a diet group of any type<BR>
would do the same thing the doctors do. Close their minds instead of open<BR>
them to the possibility that what works for person X may need a bit of<BR>
tweaking for person Z.<BR>
        I strongly encourage all to be kind and caring in their posts to either<BR>
list. Two wrongs have never made a right.  And as I have told my kids for<BR>
years and I wrote to the other list always think before you write , &quot; What<BR>
would Jesus say and do &quot; ( Or Allah, Budda etc.)  I think we have all<BR>
learned that the written word is easily misinterpreted , we cannot hear the<BR>
inflection of a person's voice or see the smile when they type . To often<BR>
things have been misunderstood. And a joke is taken as a slam against<BR>
another when that was never the intention.<BR>
        I will continue looking forward to all the good things shared .<BR>
                                                               Take Care,<BR>

Subject: <B>Dr. Lutz: &quot;Life without bread&quot;; 
Dr. D'Adamo: &quot;Eat right for your type&quot;</B><BR>
<BR>

Hi everybody!<BR><BR>

First I want to say that I don&yen;t understand the reasons for setting up
another mailing list. I have always enjoyed discussions about the
aspects that go beyond the SCD. In my opinion no one woman or one man is
able to find &quot;the diet&quot; that suits all sufferers from IBD. Our greatest
problem is lack of information, especially on the part of doctors.
Limiting ourselves to discussing only E. Gottschall's book (as much as I
appreciate it) in my eyes means limiting the chances for some of us to
get better. The SCD points in the right direction but it doesn't
necessarily have to be the magic key to IBD.<BR><BR>

So we have to collect what other doctors found to be effective in
healing IBD, and by comparing different strategies we might find out
what they have in common. On this basis everyone will then be able to
finetune their diet according to their specific needs. E.g. I found out
that I do much better without dairy products and by reading Dr. D'Adamos
book &quot;Eat right 4 your type&quot; I found out why: dairy products commonly
don't agree with my blood type (A).
<BR><BR>
Before I tell you what I learned from Dr. Lutz's book I want to let you
know my experience with &quot;budesonid&quot; (brand name:Entocort) enemas. About
2 months ago, after aprox. 3 months on the SCD, I started feeling worse.
A rectoscopy showed excessive inflammation of my lower colon (the area
where it has been before). You guys know what that means: blood, mucous,
frequent bowel movements etc. For the first time I opted for a cortison
drug, and this budesonid seems to have helped enormously. I have been
using it for 2 weeks now and since I stopped having dairy products I
have got much better: one bowel movement a day, normal stool, some
blood. And it seems I am getting better and better. I don't only
attribute my improvement to the drug but as much as I dislike drugs I
know they are necessary sometimes.<BR><BR>

Dr. Lutz's book, as you who have read the excerpt on Mik's site know, is
based on the theory that the human digestive tract has not adapted to
our westernized high carbohydrate diet. Therefore he recommends a diet
limited to a daily intake of 70-80g of carbos. Contrary to the SCD he
does not differenciate between good and bad carbos, just the daily
amount is important. As to why this diet helps in most cases of IBD he
does not give an explanation in &quot;Life without bread&quot;. But he does so in
his new book &quot;Sick stomach, sick bowel, what really helps&quot;: Without
being able to repeat the medical details the bottom line is that to many
carbos cause a faster passage of food through the digestive tract, and
this causes especially the ends of the small and big bowel to inflame
because of the not properly digested food. So according to Dr. Lutz eat
like our prehistorian ancestors: lots of meat and some vegies and fruit.
<BR><BR>
This dietary recommendation is largely confirmed by Dr. D'Adamo in his
book &quot;Eat right 4 your type&quot;. He reveals a very interesting connection
between a person's bloodtype and dietary regimes following therefrom.
The bottom line of this book is: Eat as the ancestors of your bloodtype
did, and since most people have bloodtype &quot;0&quot; it is best for them to
have lots of meat and hardly any grains. As for my bloodtype &quot;A&quot; more
grains and no red meat is recommended, I can have fish though. Get a
copy of the book! It is definitely worth reading.
<BR><BR>
Since grains are forbidden on the SCD and the intake of the remaining
foods containing carbos will probably not exceed 80g/day my conclusion
is that these three diets are basically the same according to the
majority of the people. Interesting, isn't it?
<BR><BR>
As for me I am going to stick with the SCD trying to limit my
carbohydrate intake and finetuning it following Dr. D'Adamos
recommendations as to which foods are BENEFICIAL, NEUTRAL ore
DETRIMENTAL for my bloodtype. It seems to work. And never forget the
psychological implications of your disease, mostly it is not only diet!
<BR><BR>
If anyone is interested in the parts of Dr. Lutz's new book concerning
IBD I can mail it to him/her, in German though!<BR><BR>

All the best<BR><BR>
