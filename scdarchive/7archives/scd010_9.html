&gt; Hi, some of the recipes in the SCD call for raw egg.<BR>
&gt; Has anyone ever had a problem with this?  There is a<BR>
&gt; risk of contracting samonella from ingesting raw egg..<BR>
&gt; I personally am a little afraid to try it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Regards/Liz<BR><BR></FONT>

I have made my own mayonnaise all my life with raw egg and have never
(knock on wood!) had a problem.  But I wouldn't actually *advise* anyone
to do this, although I will continue to do so.  I personally can't
imagine enjoying mayonnaise made with some pasteurized egg &quot;product&quot;,
and I do buy organic eggs (from free range hens) which are probably less
risky than the ordinary factory farm egg.  I just figure that since I'm
neither an infant nor (yet) elderly that if I ever got samonella I'd
survive it :-).  <BR>Maybe I'd change my ways if I ever actually did get
sick from my homemade mayonnaise...<BR><BR>

Take care,<BR><BR>

Deborah<BR>
