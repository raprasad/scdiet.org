Excerpt from a fax from Elaine Gottschall<BR>
 To: Lotte Wackerhagen<BR>
<BR>
  Date: September 8, 1997<BR>
<BR>
(...) I would like to address this main
issue: why commercial yoghurt is unsatisfactory and SHOULD NOT BE USED. This 
question has been asked me constantly by many people and I have almost run out of
patience in going over the biochemistry of this. So, if Mik Aidt would put it
into his repository of information on the SCD, I would be most grateful.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commercial yoghurt</B><BR>
 Practically every dairy in Northern America has Dept. of Agriculture
instructions for making commercial yoghurt.<BR>
 They may start with liquid milk straight from the cow (pasteurized) or they may
start with milk solids. However, at the beginning, the ADD additional milk
solids. This automatically increases the lactose content. For example, if cow's
milk originally has 10% lactose (10 gms per 100 mls) then the addition brings it
up to 20% or even 30%.<BR>
 The second step is to introduce the bacterial cultures (usually Lactobacillus
Bulgaricus and Steptococcus Thermophilus). At this point the acid/base - the pH
of the milk - is much like human fluid, around 7.2-7.3 (almost neutral on the pH
scale). The bacteria immediately start converting the lactose to lactic acid
which is the primary step in making yoghurt. This brings the pH down from neutral
to about 4.5 as the lactic ACID accumulates. (Acid lowers pH as our stomach acid
brings the pH of our stomachs down to about 2).<BR>
 When the pH hits about 4.5, the bacterial enzymes cannot further convert the
remaining lactose. Bacterial enzymes (as is true of all enzymes) are very
fastidious as to the acid/alkaline enviroment. Because of the addetional lactose
added at the beginning of the process, the yoghurt often contains at this stage
as much, and probably more, lactose than a glass of milk would.<BR>
 The companies also use a very short incubation time which is not even sufficient
to convert normal milk lactose completely.<BR>
<BR>
  Dr. Sidney Haas instructed us to make our own yoghurt. I DID!!! When I studied,
I had to learn manufacturing techniques and I did to the best of my ability. I
never dreamed that people who are sick as those with IBD would challenge and
question and balk at this. It is beyond my ability to understand.

The book doesn't mention this but you really should boil everything
that comes in contact with the yoghurt for a few minutes. If you are using
plastic items, you can use a dishwasher with a chlorine based detergent
with the heat set on high. try to time your yoghurt making activbity to
when the dishwasher cycle finishes.
<BR>
You need to boil for just a minute or so or hold the temp above 60 degrees 
celsius for at least 15 mins. (this is what
the dishwasher should do.<BR>
As for the milk, its probably best to let it stand covered, for 15 mins
before cooling in a tub of water.<BR>
<BR>
The same principles as canning are applicable<BR>

I have noticed many seem to be having trouble making the homemade yogurt.<BR>
This particular brand of yogurt maker was recommended to us by another lady<BR>
on theSCD.  It is the YOGOURMET II ELECTRIC YOGURT MAKER.  It makes two<BR>
litres at a time in one large batch.  The yogurt quality is excellent. 
For<BR>
anyone who may be interested, I purchased mine from a local health food<BR>
store for about 70 dollars Canadian.  If you have difficulty finding one,<BR>
the supplier address is as follows:<BR>
Lyo-San Inc., 500 boul. di L'Aeroparc, C.P. 598, Lachute, QC, Canada, <BR>
J8H 4G4<BR>
I hope this information can be of use to you.<BR>

<B>Yogurt questions</B><BR>
 Fri, 10 Jan 1997 17:22:29 GMT<BR>
<BR><BR>

Steve,<BR><BR>

I don't use a yogurt maker, I make mine in the oven by replacing the oven's
light bulb with a 60 watt bulb.  A 60 watt bulb keeps the temp at exactly
100 degrees in my oven, so it works perfect for me.<BR><BR>

I use half & half, not milk to make my yogurt.  I bring it to a rolling
boil on the stove first to kill all the bacteria in the half &amp; half.  I
then let it cool to room temp before adding the yogurt culture or you will
kill the yogurt culture if its too hot.<BR><BR>

Then I put it in the oven in a covered container and turn the light on.  If
I want real thick, rich yogurt, I usually leave it in for 30 or more hours
instead of the usual 24 hours.  And I never use any of my homemade yogurt
as starter for the next batch.  I always buy new starter yogurt from the
store.<BR><BR>

I don't like the taste of yogurt when you mix honey in it, so I am trying
to find different ways to sweeten it.  I found that if you finely chop
about a cup of raisins and mix it into the yogurt, then leave it in the
fridge overnight, the raisins will sweeten the yogurt very nicely. 
Strawberries will also work.<BR><BR>

Kari, I don't know the answer to your question about the affects of
temperature (hot or cold) on yogurt after its made.  But I hope someone
answers it because I would sure like to know.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
The yogurt should not be runny.  It should be the same consistency of regular
commercial yogurt.  If it is runny, you likely have done something wrong. 
Ensure that the starter you are using is fresh.  If the commercial yogurt you
use for starter is old, the active bacterial culture may be mostly dead.  Make
sure you heat the milk to boiling temperature, and then cool to room temp. 
Make sure everything that comes in contact with the yogurt (pots, utensils,
yogurt maker cups) are sterilized (very clean), like out of the dishwasher, or
washed in hot soapy water.  Make sure you do not add any other ingredients to
the yogurt besides the milk and the starter.  Flavorings are to be added when
the yogurt is completely done and chilled.<BR>
Hope these tips help.  Proper fermenting temperature is also important.  If you
have an actual yogurt maker, this should not be a problem, whereas the oven
method is trickier, because the temp. can fluctuate over the 24 hour period,
and you may not know it.  This could result in ruined runny yogurt.
I remember at one time, someone had posted a whole list of tips for yogurt
making.  If someone still has this, please post it again.<BR>

It should be set like custard when you make it . After you scoop it out
of 
the containers it may become runny as the whey separates, that's normal
but 
at end of incubation, it should be set like shop yoghurt. It could be not 
enough starter or a dead starter, get fresh 'continental style' yoghurt
to 
use as a starter. The name brand yoghurts are more sugar than yoghurt. Also 
if your temperature is too high or too low, the resulting product will be 
runny<BR>

Probably not, It's a case of competition for the available food, if a<BR>
particular strain of bacteria that grows well at room temperature is in<BR>
there, then Yes start again, but if you sterilized the jars before with<BR>
steam, boiling water or chlorine, I wouldn't worry. If not, don't take a<BR>
chance. The acidophilus don't grow well at room temperature and the bad<BR>
bacteria may have gotten a good head start so that there may be significant<BR>
population of bad guys in there.<BR>

<B>yogurt for sensitive stomachs</B><BR>
 Tue, 18 Feb 1997 15:45:32 GMT<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I used to have to avoid homemade yogurt because it upset my stomach every
time<BR>
and caused me to feel sick, sometimes inducing diarreah.  I used to make
it<BR>
using a good commercial yogurt as the starter, exactly as Elaine says in
the<BR>
book.  I was upset that I couldn't eat the yogurt, as it is one of the main<BR>
benefitial aspects to the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Recently I made the yogurt using a powdered storebought yogurt starter and
I<BR>
found I could tolerate the yogurt no problem.  I don't know if my body
changed,<BR>
allowing me to tolerate yogurt in general, or if the commercial starter
made it<BR>
different.  My yogurt always turned out just fine looking, and I'm sure
I was<BR>
doing it right.  Anyway, I just thought I'd let people know that if they
have<BR>
been having trouble tolerating their homemade yogurt made with commercial<BR>
yogurt as starter (containing only milk ingredients and bacterial culture),<BR>
they should try making it with powdered starter and see if it makes a<BR>
difference.  Usually you can find it in health food type stores.  The brand
I<BR>
got is called &quot;Yogourmet&quot;.  One day I'm going to make it the old
way, using<BR>
commercial starter, and see if it adversely affects me.<BR>

Hello to the Group:<BR>
<BR>
I have never cared for the commericial yohurt for use as a starter. <BR>
I suspect the bacterial culture is likely all dead long before I ever <BR>
got it home. It didnot taste as nice as what I am using now.<BR>
<BR>
I have used for three years now a dry powered form of yogurt culture, <BR>
that I buy in the health food stores. One package (approx. $1.50)<BR>
.33 oz. can make approx. 5 to 6 quarts of yoghurt or two quarts every <BR>
third day.<BR>
It is called Rosell( that is the name of the company) and made in <BR>
Montreal Que. Can. H2P 2M6 . I buy 6 packages and will last me 6 <BR>
weeks.Try your favorite health food store. This company has been around
<BR>
since 1934.<BR>

<B>Yogurt makers</B><BR>
<BR>
Hi everyone,<BR>
I'm a recent subscriber to the scd mailing list.  I started on the diet
in 
Dec 96 and continued till about the end of Jan of 97.  At the beginning
of 
the diet, I notice immediate improvement in my UC condition, however, I 
started having a return of symptoms (I figure from my use of soy sauce).
 I 
stopped the diet and am preparing to go back on it with renewed intensity.<BR>
 Just a couple of questions,  when I was on the diet, I made the yogurt
using 
a 60 watt light bulb in a cardboard box, because my oven was too large.
 I 
got the temperature just right 100-105, and the yogurt came out alright.
 I 
have recently purchased a commercial yogurt maker and the temperature is
too 
high, above 115 using my thermometer.  I was wondering if all commercial 
yogurt makers are designed to make yogurt within this temperature range.
 IF 
so, then the yogurt will not be made properly right? <BR>

Hi Ryan,<BR>
<BR>
Just make sure when you test the temperature, you are testing inside the<BR>
cups with liquid, preferably yoghurt/milk in them. I rang the manufacturer<BR>
about this and they said the temperature outside the cups has to be higher,<BR>
because it drops as it passes though the glass and is conducted through
the<BR>
full cup of milk/yoghurt.<BR>

     Ryan - Remember yogurt is an ANCIENT food, used throughout the ages
by 
     folk who had no thermometers, electricity, or glass jars.  Try your

     machine - they probably would not make something that runs too hot.<BR>

<BR>
Hello,<BR>
<BR>
I'm still using the Salton yogurt maker I got at a local Home Express store 
on clearance for $10.   I haven't tested the temperature, but I trust it 
meets the criteria for gently fostering the growth of the bacteria.    I'm 
very happy with the resulting yogurt, and I haven't had any adverse 
reactions after several weeks of use.  Since it only makes a quart, I just 
bought another one (they're now marked down to $8 - apparently they have 
several in stock, and no one else wants them).   I doubt that Home Express 
offers mail order shipping, but if you want to try, they're in the phone 
book - Dublin, CA, area code 510.  <BR>

<B>Re: yogurt makers</B><BR>

I noticed this with my yogurt maker also.  It's Salton brand, and when I
tested 
the temperature by putting water in the little cups, I found that it got
too 
high, according to Elaine's recommendation.  I asked about this, and she
seemed 
to think it was fine.  My yogurt turns out fine, but if I leave it in too
long, 
like over 24 hours, it curdles, I think from the too high heat.  It kind
of 
cooks I guess.  So I would just keep using it if you can get good yogurt
that 
you can tolerate.  I posted earlier about how I couldn't tolerate the yogurt<BR>
when I used commercial yogurt as starter, but when I tried powdered starter,
I 
could eat the yogurt no problem.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><TT>&gt;When making the yogurt I find that if  I use larger

&gt;proportionally more liquid forming mainly on top of the the yogurt than
if I<BR>

(i.e.<BR>

<BR>
Don't wory about the whey, if you are fermenting more than 24 hrs then it 
will be lactose free. The curds, are mainly protein and fat and the whey
is 
mostly water and acid. In commercial yoghurt the whey also contains most
of 
the lactose. Elaine said, when questioned about the liquid whey that you 
should drink it too.<BR>
The whey containing acid creates an environment that is dangerous for 
unfriendly bacteria and conducive tothe &quot;acid loving&quot; cultures.<BR>
You can get a firmer yoghurt by using a starter yoghurt that contains a 
blend of bacteria e.g. acidophilus, bifidus and L. Cassei<BR>
Also the temperature is critical for getting firm and lactose free yoghurt.<BR>
Use a fresh starter yoghurt old cultures will grow more slowly.<BR>

hope that helps<BR>

&gt; He asked me if he could substitute Buttermilk?  He's in Sweden, and <BR>
&gt;they have a wide variety of different milks. <BR>
&gt; 
<BR>
&gt;Dear K.D., &gt;Frankly I know nothing about buttermilk. If it is a product to
which <BR>
&gt;nothing additional has been added, I would guess that it is as usable
as <BR>
&gt;half &amp; half is in making yogurt. You might want to check with Elaine,
her tel <BR>
&gt;is (905) 349-3420.<BR></FONT>
<BR>

To KD and others, As far as drinking store bought buttermilk instead of eating
homemade yogurt, you would have to ensure that the product has no lactose, which
can be difficult. You don't know how the company makes it and how long they
ferment it.  As the book says, it takes 24 hours of fermentation to get rid of
virtually all the lactose, and most dairy producers do not bother fermenting
their cultured dairy products that long, as it's not necessary to get a
salable product. Since it is necessary for us on the SCD, we must make our own
cultured products.<BR>
<BR>

As for using store bought buttermilk instead of milk or cream to make yogurt,
I have never tried it, but I don't think it will work.  If anything, you would
get sour cream, not yogurt at the end of it.  I did some research about cultured
dairy products and learned how to make my own sour cream.<BR>
<BR>

Store bought buttermilk can be used as a STARTER to make homemade SOUR CREAM.
 You do it the same way as you make yogurt, using half and half or whipping
cream.  You must ensure the cream has no bad additives in in though.  In
my area I can not find any brand of whipping cream that does not have carageenen
or other crap added. (Not only is it bad in general to have additives for
yogurt/sour cream making purposes, but I have read several articles that
said carageenen has been used as an agent to CAUSE Crohn's in lab rats! ) 
<BR>Anyway, you can make sour cream the same way as yogurt, but it needs to be
fermented
at a lower temperature.  The way I figured out how to do it is to make a batch
of yogurt and then put the batch of sour cream ON TOP of the yogurt containers,
and wrap the whole machine with a thick bath towel.  I have a Salton yogurt maker
with those 7 little glass cups.  I simply don't put the big plastic
cover on top of the machine, and put the sour cream batch directly on top of the
little jars (in a bowl or other glass/ceramic container).  Covering it all
with a towel acts like a &quot;tea cozy&quot;, retaining the heat.  This way
the sour cream can ferment at the lower temperature required.<BR>
<BR>

The only difference between yogurt and sour cream is the fat content (usually
sour cream is made with full fat heavy cream, and yogurt is lighter); and
the SPECIES of bacteria used as a &quot;culture&quot; are different.  You can
buy powdered starter for sour cream, or use buttermilk or commercial sour cream. 
I found
it impossible to find a store bought brand of sour cream that has no bad
additives though, so I use buttermilk whose ingredients are: milk, bacterial
culture, salt.<BR>
<BR>

I don't think many people are aware that we are allowed to have sour cream
on the SCD &quot;if we can find one with minimal lactose&quot;, as it says
in the book.  Since this product did not exist in my area, I researched on the
net how
to make it.  That's when I found out how to make DCCC also, but I'm not that
ambitious, since I can buy a perfectly good DCCC here at the stores.  Personally,
I LOVE sour cream, and being raised on a lot of Hungarian cuisine which has a lot
of sour cream in many of the dishes, I can find lots of
uses for it.<BR>
<BR>

Try it, it really can add tremendous variety to your meals and it's something
different!  If anyone needs any more tips on making it, or recipes using
it, just ask me.<BR>
<BR>

K.D., Unfortunately, I don't think your son will be able to get away with NOT
making homemade yogurt or sour cream for this diet, because as I mentioned above,
commercial producers don't have a need to ferment their products that long
and we need products with very low levels of lactose.  You could do the diet
omitting the yogurt, but I think it is quite a benefitial part of the whole
plan.<BR>
<BR>

Sorry this post is so long, but sometimes there is a lot to say! Anna<BR>

&gt;the commercial yoghurt that I use as a starter. It does smell and taste<BR>
&gt;like yoghurt. What am I doing wrong? It is being make in my<BR>
&gt;oven with a 60watt light bulb. Should you leave the lids on the<BR>
&gt;jars when it is in the oven? Also I leave it in the oven for at least<BR>
&gt;30 hours before removing it.<BR>

I think you better go out and buy a real yogurt maker. They are fairly<BR>
inexpensive (usually $30 or less) and it is well worth it for this diet.
We<BR>
NEED the yogurt for the diet. It is like MEDICINE practically. The oven<BR>
method is not very reliable. I tried testing the oven method too before
I<BR>
bought my maker, but I didn't make yogurt, I just left a jar of water in
there<BR>
and I tested the temperature every couple hours. I found it impossible to
get<BR>
a consistent temperature in there. It is no good if the temperature<BR>
fluctuates, and it sounds like this is what's happening with yours. If you
get<BR>
a maker, your yogurt and sour cream will turn out beautiful and firm every<BR>
time. It's 10 times better than any store bought yogurt or sour cream anyway.
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

Hi Julie,<BR>
<BR>
We found our Yogurt Maker in a Health Food Store. The brand is Yogourmet<BR>
II Electric Yogurt Maker. It makes great yogurt always very thick and<BR>
creamy much nicer than any commercial yogurt I ever tried. The company you<BR>
could contact to find out where to purchase one in your area is Lyo-San
Inc.<BR>
C.P. 598, Lachute, QC. Canada, J8H 4G4<BR>
The phone # is 1-514-562-8525. <BR>
We have tried other yogurt makers but never got the excellent quality yogurt<BR>
we get with the Yogourment II. Actually this brand was recommonded to us
by<BR>
Lucy Rosset (Ist Testimonial on the back cover of Breaking the Vicious<BR>
Cycle. Hope this info helps.<BR>

When Jon started the diet last July, I bought a yogurt maker. It's been<BR>
worth it. Makes two quarts of beautiful, thick yogurt at a time with very<BR>
little hassle. Here's the address I found in the instruction book:<BR>
Yogourmet II<BR>
Rolmex Electro Inc.<BR>
2334, Marie-Victorin<BR>
Varennes, Quebec, Canada Jol 2PO<BR>
<BR>
We keep the yogurt in the yogurt maker for at least 24 hours. Also we use<BR>
half and half, plus one paket of unflavored gelatin.<BR>

<B>How to get a Yogurt Maker</B><BR>
Wed, 30 Apr 1997 19:35:38 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Good News!<BR>
To all those who asked where they could get a yogurt maker, I found the
Salton<BR>
Maxim Company homepage at 
<A
HREF="http://www.salton-maxim.com/index.html">http://www.salton-maxim.com/index.html<BR>
</A><BR>
They have a lot of small appliances and you can order them via the internet,<BR>
phone, or fax. It seems quite reasonably priced at $19.99. Visit the&quot;Fun<BR>
Food&quot; section of their site to see the yogurt maker at:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.salton-maxim.com/healthyalt/funfoods.html">
http://www.salton-maxim.com/healthyalt/funfoods.html</A><BR>
<BR>
and
<A HREF="http://www.qvc.com/scripts/detail.dll?Product&K33326">
http://www.qvc.com/scripts/detail.dll?Product&K33326</A><BR><BR>

I also phoned and asked what stores you could find their products in. They<BR>
said they supply to the following stores but you should call the stores
near<BR>
you to find out if they stock the yogurt makers:<BR>
Macy's<BR>
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond<BR>
Montgomery Wards<BR>
Linens &amp; Things<BR>
Service Merchandise<BR>
Wal Mark<BR>
K Mart<BR>
Target<BR>
<BR>
The Salton company in Canada is totally different from the U.S. one. I called<BR>
them and they said they do not sell to consumers directly in any way. They<BR>
only supply to stores like The Bay and London Drugs. If you are in Canada,
I<BR>
would call these stores and find out where you can get a maker.<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck on finding one and Happy Yogurt Making!<BR>

Jim,<BR>
Do you add honey or dextrose to your yogurt before eating it?  I do.  I
find<BR>
you have to add some sweetener to counteract the tartness.  I believe the<BR>
tartness is caused by the long fermentation period that we do.  The store<BR>
bought stuff is only fermented for two or three hours and still has a lot
of<BR>
natural lactose (sugar) in it from the milk or cream.  That's why it's not
as<BR>
sour as our wonderful homemade kind.  I think it's good for us though, so
we<BR>
should try to stomach it.  I never really noticed that they get more and
more<BR>
tart as time goes on.  I thought they were just really tart to begin with.
 I<BR>
don't think you can freeze them and then unthaw them.  If you freeze them,
you<BR>
could use it to make frozen yogurt and purree it in a food processor I guess.<BR>
<BR>
I just eat it fresh and I add vanilla extract and honey or dextrose, or<BR>
applesauce, honey, and cinnamon, or just cinnamon and dextrose, or homemade<BR>
blueberry sauce made with honey.  You can make nice variations.  Use your<BR>
imagination.  Look at all the flavours they have in the store bought yogurts.
<BR>
Try to copy them.  Apple cinnamon is quite tasty.<BR>
Hope this helps!<BR>

Anna: I don't like the taste of yogurt w/honey.  But I like eating the<BR>
yogurt the first couple of days after I make it.  It is not tart at all!
<BR>
But after about 4-5 days, it gets really tart/sour.  I guess I will stop<BR>
making big batches of yogurt and start eating it faster.  It was just so<BR>
much trouble to make, I started making big batches thinking it would last<BR>
me a couple weeks.<BR>
<BR>
I add fruit to sweeten the yogurt for a treat.  But I also mix up several<BR>
spices until I get a type of ranch dressing for my salads.  I usually add<BR>
salt, pepper, garlic &amp; onion powder, a pinch of this, a dash of that...<BR>
pour it over avocado &amp; leaf lettuce, or use it as a veggie dip.  I'm<BR>
starting to get hungry... &lt;g&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Jim Prousalis: 3-4 days is all yogurt will keep?  Crap!  I hate making the<BR>
stuff every 3-4 days.  Is the lactobacillus in the yogurt the stuff that<BR>
helps to heal our crohn's?  So if the yogurt is starting to taste tart,<BR>
then its probably not doing me any good, right?  Bummer!<BR>

     Yogurt will last for more than two weeks.  To repeat, this old and

     in my old Salton 5-banger for 48 hours instead of 24 and there was

      I wash and reuse the same old plastic yogurt cups and caps that came

     originally from the super market.  I bring a mixture of half &amp;
half <BR>
     and whole milk to a boil, cool it in the sink in cold water and mix
<BR>
     with a couple of heaping tablespoons of regular plain yogurt, and pour
<BR>
     it in the 8 oz cups (I have set aside the original glass cups as being

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks, <BR>

It is the consistency of powdered confectioners sugar and I buy it at a
store<BR>
called Galloway's.  It's a chain of stores around here that carry bulk
spices,<BR>
dried fruits, candies, health foods, and imported foods.  It's in Vancouver,<BR>
Canada.  I don't know if they exist elsewhere.  It is not as sweet as sugar,
so<BR>
you have to use more, but it causes me no problems that I have noticed,
as well<BR>
as my girlfriend who's had CD for 8 years.  It is kind of nice to use it<BR>
sometimes, although I could easily live without it.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, also, I once found some in an East Indian grocery store (came in a<BR>
cardboard box, like a juice box and is meant for &quot;convelescing
people&quot;),
but<BR>
the quality was gross.  I won't buy it there ever again because I found
this<BR>
pure source at Galloway's.  It comes in clear plastic small sacs and is
quite<BR>
cheap at $1.19 (Canadian) for 400grams (1/2 lb).<BR>

Well, I got my new Salton yogurt maker the other day. Just made a batch<BR>
and found that the temp. went up to 115-117 degrees F. I was afraid it<BR>
would be too high but I tasted a few spoonfulls -- I so want to be able<BR>
to eat yogurt. I started to have a reaction, bloating, white coated<BR>
tongue. I can eat cheese, so I know it's not dairy in general. I'm<BR>
pretty disappointed so far. Does anyone know how to lower the<BR>
temperature slightly on one of these things -- maybe leaving the top off<BR>
would do it? Otherwise I think I will return it.<BR>

Hi Denise and all on the list.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Re: Temperature contol for yoghurt making devices.</B><BR>
<BR>
These are my opinions, while not written in stone ,they do come from the
School Of Hard Knox. and the need to make good yoghurt. <BR>
<BR>
A short back ground reference. <BR>
<BR>
I have U.C. and have enjoyed Elaine's Diet for four years and two months.<BR>
First remission lasted over two years. The one and only flare I have experienced
since beginning the diet, I believe resulted while trying to come off the
diet. I ate refined sugars and starches, for a period of approx.six to eight
months. The well known symptoms slowly but surely returned. With much pain,
blood and HOT FOOTING it to the nearest restroom, it wasnt a hard decicion
to realize I needed to go back to the diet. I am now into the tenth month
of this remission. No meds. of any nature for nine months. Generally in
good spirits, sometimes I have a good energy reserve, sometimes I dont,
but I am no longer a young man either. In simple terms of my health, I look
better than some I know at my age. Thoughout the entire diet of over four
years I have always made my own yoghurt. I believe it to be an essential
ingredient of the diet.<BR>
<BR>
With out going into how I choose to make my own yoghurt, I will address
only the Control of the Heat of an electrical device used for the purpose
of make yoghurt.<BR>
<BR>
1. A good thermometer is of the utmost importance to knowing the temperature
within the yoghurt, and shouldnt be attempted without it.<BR>
<BR>
2. Regardless of the construction or present control of the existing unit
you may use, if there is ANY doubt about temperature control, I have found
the following to be exellent. <BR>
By purchasing a plug into the wall electrical light dimmer switch, plug
it into an electrical outlet.<BR>
(The same type of thing used to dimm a regular house light) Then plug your
yoghurt making devise into the outlet of the dimmer switch. This will affort
infinite control of the electrical current to your yoghurt making device.
Allowing you to raise or lower the temperature by as little as 1 or 2 degrees
at a time. The only change in temperature you will see, once you learn where
to set the control, is a very slow change should there be a tramatic room
temperature change. (Ambient temperature of the room.) <BR>
<BR>
Although I will admit it is not thermostatically contolled, I have presently
used this system for four years and find it exellent.<BR>
Hope this will be of some benifet to those on the list making yoghurt.<BR>
I will answer your questions should there be any. <BR>
<BR>
Good Health<BR>

Tue, 13 May 1997 0:47:54 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I noticed this about my yogurt maker in the beginning too. I don't think
the<BR>
higher temperature is a problem. If the yogurt isn't agreeing with you,
it may<BR>
be the starter. Are you using commercial yogurt as a starter or powdered<BR>
yogurt starter? I found that I had major problems with the yogurt until
I<BR>
switched to powdered starter, YOGORMET brand, which I buy at the health
food<BR>
stores.<BR>
<BR>
Don't give up yet. Also, I think that it may depend on what stage your<BR>
inflamation is at right now. You should try waiting a while and then try
the<BR>
yogurt again. Make sure you chill it well before eating it. Try using half<BR>
and half cream instead of milk also. Hope these ideas help. Good luck!<BR>

Both logic and what Elaine says indicate to me that the temperature of a<BR>
yoghurt maker is crucial. Will's solution sounds great. However, so that<BR>
we all can learn I hope you will also call the manufacturer and find out<BR>
what the temperature is supposed to be, and assuming that's less than<BR>
your's is ask them to explain how you could have gotten such a hot one.<BR>

<B>Yogurt Temperature</B><BR>
Tue, 13 May 1997 18:10:07 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi Ya'll; Let me ad more on the temperature control of yogurt. The first<BR>
thing you need to do before you rely on a thermometer is to &quot;calibrate&quot;
it.<BR>
I assume that most are using the dial therm that you see carried in the<BR>
pockets of most refrigeration/air conditioning technitions. What most people<BR>
do not realize is that if that theermometer is forced into a piece of meat
in<BR>
a twisting motion 9 times out of ten the calibration has been comprimised.<BR>
To Calibrate take a glass or cup and pack it with crushed ice, then fill<BR>
with cold water. Insert the therm probe into the ice water and allow to<BR>
stabilize. When stabilized it should read 32degrees farenheight or 0 degrees<BR>
Celsius. If does not then it needs to calibrated. To calibrate, while still<BR>
in the ice water hold the nut at the bottom side of the dial assy and grab<BR>
the outer edge of the dial and turn as needed to set the pointer on 32/0
as<BR>
the case may be. The therm is now calibrated. If you have a therm that<BR>
does not have a range that goes down to the freezing point then do it in
a<BR>
pot of boiling water. Water boils at 212/100 F/C (at sea level). After you<BR>
have assured that the therm is calibrated you can rely on it as long as
you<BR>
do not force it into somethig like meat in a twisting motion or DROP it.
If<BR>
you have a therm that you can not calibrate then you will have to note the<BR>
difference and add or subtract from any reading that you take.<BR>

Exellent advice re: be sure your thermometer is accurate.<BR>
<BR>
I place my thermometer under my tongue if I feel it should be checked.<BR>
It always comes out reading 98 decimal something, on a normal day . <BR>
This allows the test to take place very near the temperature area it will
be used in the 105-108 deegrees f. <BR>

<B>Yogurt Starter and Whey</B><BR>
Tue, 13 May 1997 22:48:08 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi All:<BR>
<BR>
I have a question about yogurt starter which I hope someone in the group
can<BR>
answer, but first, I guess I should introduce myself. <BR>
<BR>
I've had UC for 7 years and been on and off Dipentum, Asacol and Prednisone<BR>
with few &quot;remissions.&quot; Two months ago I was back on Prednisone,
and<BR>
seriously considering having my colon removed, when I found this group on
the<BR>
net. I've been on the diet for 6 weeks and so far I think that it's nothing<BR>
short of miraculous. I'm off the Prednisone and have not felt better in
as<BR>
long as I can remember (I know it's early, but I'm keeping my fingers<BR>
crossed).<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I've been following the diet &quot;fanatically&quot; and am very
anxious about<BR>
accidentally cheating. I had been unable to find powdered commercial yogurt<BR>
starter, so I've been making yogurt using commercial yogurt as a starter<BR>
(which only contains whole milk and acidophilus). The yogurt has been very<BR>
good but it's been somewhat inconvenient to keep going to the health food<BR>
store to get fresh yogurt. The other day I finally found powdered starter<BR>
(&quot;Natren&quot; brand) which contains whey. Otherwise, it's all natural
(milk<BR>
solids and bacteria). Is it okay to use this starter? Will the lactose in<BR>
the whey be eliminated during the 24 hour fermenting period? Any advice<BR>
would be appreciated. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks!<BR>

Dear Laurie,<BR>
I'm not sure about the whey powder, but whey is actually the sour or tart<BR>
tasting liquid that is produced when the yogurt is made. I guess they may
add<BR>
starch to whey powder but I'm not certain. If the yogurt has been agreeing<BR>
with you then I would not worry. Regarding the commercial yogurt, if you
buy a<BR>
big container at the store, it should last about 3 weeks usually, and this<BR>
would make a lot of yogurt since you only need a few tablespoons for each<BR>
batch. I personally found the powdered starter to be more agreeable, but
mine<BR>
(YOGORMET brand) has no whey added. It does have lactose, but it's ok because<BR>
that gets destroyed by the bacteria in the 24 hour fermentation.<BR>
<BR>
Congratulations on finding this diet, getting off Pred, and feeling better!
I<BR>
had a similar experience. <BR>
I'm sure you will get more replies to this question, but if no-one knows
for<BR>

Good to hear you are finding some benefit from the SCD , hope you do well
with it .It has made my life so much easier.<BR>
I find the dry yoghurt starter makes a much better product,as well I would
certainly be at the least sceptical of what other materials may or may not
be included in the commercial ready made varieties.<BR>
I have not used the Naturen Brand you mentioned, simply because I have never
seen it in Alberta. I use a brand of dry culture made in Montreal,( thats
not too far from you.) Ask the Health food store if they might bring some
in for you to try. It is called &quot;rosell&quot; no capitals.I am very
satisfied with it. Also tried a &quot;Yogurtnet&quot; starter, I didnt care
for the taste of that.<BR>
As I understand in your post you have come directly off the Predisone ,
and didnot come off of it gradually. Seems to me from the post I have read
on this list that is not such a good idea. Maybe some one on the list here
can advice you on that matter, I have never used that drug, so and have
no personal experiece with it. But it may be worth checking. Post a note
to the group and see what responce you get.<BR>
<BR>
Best of luck<BR>

&gt;I unfortunately have yet another question for you yogurt making folks<BR>
&gt;out there. I bought a brand of powdered yogurt starter at the health<BR>
&gt;food store yesterday. Silly me, since it seemed to be a brand someone<BR>
&gt;had mentioned, I didn't read the ingredient list. Learned my lesson!
<BR>
&gt;The darn thing has sucrose listed as an ingredient. It is Yogourmet<BR>
&gt;brand from Canada. This is the complete list of ingredients:
&quot;powdered<BR>
&gt;skim milk, sucrose, ascorbic acid, lactic bacteria.&quot; I am about
to head<BR>
&gt;back to the store to see if I can return it, but I am curious if anyone<BR>
&gt;knows, would this amount of sucrose (must be small) be consumed by the<BR>
&gt;bacteria that consume the lactose? It seems like that might be true,<BR>
&gt;but I don't want to take any chances unless someone has had good<BR>
&gt;experience with this. Also, has anyone ever tried the experiment of<BR>
&gt;adding extra acidopholus or bulgaricus powder to their yogurt?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Denise<BR>
&gt;Davis, CA<BR></FONT>
<BR>
Denise,<BR>
It's ok. That brand is perfectly good. I use it all the time. Also that<BR>
rosell one is good. The sucrose is eaten by the bacteria in the 24 hour<BR>
period. You can tell by how tart our yogurt is that there is no sugar left
in<BR>
it. No worries.<BR>

&gt;Anna,<BR>
&gt;Are you sure that sucrose in the yogurt starter is actually used up
by the <BR>
&gt;bacteria?  If this was the case it would seem strange that Elaine states
so <BR>
&gt;clearly in her book that if we use commercial yogurt as a starter we
should<BR>
buy <BR>
&gt;unsweetened yogurt.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Take care,<BR>
&gt;Tina (Ontario, Canada)<BR></FONT>
<BR>
Tina,<BR>
I'm sure it's fine.  The amount of sucrose in the powdered starter is
miniscule<BR>
compared to the tons they put in commercial sweetened yogurt, and plus,<BR>
commercial sweetened yogurt usually has all kinds of other crap and
flavorings<BR>
included as well.  That's why Elaine says not to use commercial sweetened<BR>
yogurt.  All the crap they add probably affects the properties of the live<BR>
bacteria.  Don't worry.  Just use the starter, try the yogurt, and relax.
 If<BR>
it doesn't agree with you, then you'll have something to worry about.<BR>
<BR>
To Denise and others concerned about the temperature of the yogurt makers:<BR>
My friend Cristina who has been on this diet since the book Food and the
Gut<BR>
Reaction came out, has talked to Elaine several times over the years and
Elaine<BR>
told her that any electric yogurt maker is fine.  The temperature she wrote
in<BR>
the book is basically an ESTIMATE.  As you can see from some other things
in<BR>
the book, she is not always EXACT about things.  Look at the carrot cake
recipe<BR>
and some of the other recipes.  If you follow it to the letter, you get
a big<BR>
mushy mess, not a cake!  It's a boo boo in the book, and there ARE several.
  I<BR>
can understand your worries about not getting the yogurt too hot because
it<BR>
says that in the book, but Elaine even said that the Yogurt Makers know
what<BR>
their doing.  They are not designed to go above the desireable yogurt making<BR>
tempurature range.  A few degrees isn't going to make a difference.  You
know,<BR>
in the old days, they didn't have electricity and appliances like us, and
they<BR>
still managed to make good yogurt.  If you have an electric maker, just
use it<BR>
and leave it on for 24 hours.  That's all you need to worry about.  The
24<BR>
hours takes care of everything.  The dimmer thing sounds like a good idea,
but<BR>
it's simply unecessary for electric yogurt makers.  You cannot use thermous<BR>
type yogurt makers though, as it says in the book.  If your yogurt comes
out<BR>
firm and nice, then you suceeded.  If it's still runny, then there is a<BR>
problem.  You should be able to turn the jar of yogurt upside down (those<BR>
little ones anyway) and it should not come out.  It is completely coagulated<BR>
and FIRM.  If this is not the case, then you may have a problem with your<BR>
appliance, or there may be an error in the preparation of the milk/cream.
 I<BR>
highly recommend using half and half.  Don't worry about the high fat
content,<BR>
it's good for you.  Even if you need to lose weight, it will still happen.
<BR>
It's way better tasting.<BR>
<BR>
I know we are supposed to be fanatical about this diet, but let's just be<BR>
reasonable.  The electric Salton makers are perfectly fine.  It's actually
the<BR>
best way to do it.  Elaine said so herself!  I'm just trying to calm all
you<BR>
people down who are worrying themselves sick over the temperature thing,
when<BR>
they have an electric yogurt maker.  If you are using a snake rock or similar<BR>
such contraption, then maybe you need a dimmer.<BR>

Your idea about adding extra acidophilus or bulgaricus to the yogurt<BR>
intrigued me so I spoke to a biochemist friend of mine about it.<BR>
 Unfortunately, according to him, &quot;this experiment would be
self-defeating<BR>
since increasing the amount of bacteria without proportionately increasing<BR>
the amount of milk (the food for the bacteria) would alter the flavor and<BR>
decrease the active life of the yogurt.  In other words, the bacteria would<BR>
run out of food faster and therefore die quicker.&quot;  I'm not sure he's
right,<BR>
but it seems to make sense, so I thought I'd share his opinion.<BR>

<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
<TT>&gt;Does anyone know why it is &quot;ok&quot; to consume the milk that
the allowable<BR>
&gt;cheeses<BR>
&gt;contain (swiss &amp; cheddar) but not consume milk in any other
form?</TT><BR></FONT>
<BR>
The reason is that milk contains much lactose which is a form of sugar we
can't<BR>
digest (disacharide) with more than one molecule. The allowable cheeses
are<BR>
fermented milk products. The process used in making the cheeses uses
microbial<BR>
enzymes and a long fermentation period which eliminates the majority of
the<BR>
lactose, making it tolerable to us. The same principle goes for the homemade<BR>
yogurt. Store bought yogurts (all brands) are not allowable on the SCD
because<BR>
they only ferment them for about 4 hours, leaving much lactose remaining
in the<BR>
final product. We ferment our homemade yogurt for 24 full hours, in order
to<BR>
eliminate all the lactose. You see, the longer these cultured dairy products<BR>
are fermented, the less lactose remains because the bacteria or enzymes
that<BR>
are introduced into the recipe (ie. starter), are actually live organisms
which<BR>
in effect eat up the sugar (lactose) in the milk, and produce lactic acid<BR>
(making it sour). I hope this answers your question. (Correct me if I'm
wrong<BR>
on any of these details - other list members). <BR>
<BR>
&gt; Also, is the Tomatoe juice made by Campbell's an allowable tomatoe
juice.<BR>
<BR>
I don't know about Cambell's, maybe someone else can answer this, but as
a last<BR>
resort, you could write to the company and explain your situation.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;finally, does anyone know a brand name for the unflavored/unswseetened<BR>
&gt;yoghurt that's permitted on the diet?<BR>
<BR>
There is none because no company is going to spend all that time, fermenting
it<BR>
extra long because most people don't know the difference and they don't
need it<BR>
fermented that long. Unfortunately, we have to make our own. There are some<BR>
inexpensive yogurt machines out there (under 30 dollars), and after a while
it<BR>
becomes kind of fun and rewarding to make your own. It actually takes less<BR>
time than you may think.<BR>
Good luck,<BR>

Lactose Intolerance: Not an Allergy<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Lactose intolerance is not a food allergy but an inability to digest a sugar
found in dairy products.<BR>
[U.S. Pharmacist 22(5):21-22, 26-27, 1997]<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Author: W. Steven Pray, Ph.D., R.Ph., Professor, Pharmaceutics, School of
Pharmacy, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Excerpts:<BR>
======<BR>
Lactose intolerance is one of a number of food intolerances. The term &quot;food
intolerance&quot; denotes a nonimmunologically based inability to properly
metabolize certain food groups. <BR>
<BR>
The lay public often confuses lactose intolerance with an allergy to milk.
Milk allergy is an immunologic problem that is different from lactose intolerance
in its causes and treatments. <BR>
<BR>
It is estimated that 25% of American adults and 75% of adults worldwide
have lactose intolerance; as many as 7.5 million Americans suffer from severe
lactose intolerance. It is present in 15% of white adults, 45% of Eskimos,
81% of black adults, and 100% of Asian adults.<BR>
<BR>
Symptoms of cow's milk protein allergy include vomiting (which is uncommon
in lactose intolerance), diarrhea (perhaps bloody stools), angio-edema,
urticaria, rhinitis, nasal congestion and wheezing.<BR>

Hi Bill<BR>
<BR>
The commercial yogurt is a poor starter,  likely all the culture is dead<BR>
long before it was ever placed on the store shelf.<BR>
<BR>
You didnt mention where on the continent you reside Bill , so I am not sure<BR>
you if you can obtain the starter I use called  &quot;rosell&quot;  (all small
case )<BR>
Made in Montreal. I believe it to have a decidedly better taste than the<BR>
Yogormet starter. But then each to his own, after all taste is all in our<BR>
mouth.<BR>
The rosell is readly available in health food stores or I can give you the<BR>
address of the manufacture if you desire . I have used it for four years<BR>
and enjoy .<BR>

    About the commercial yogurt, I don't know WHY, but I don't think it would
work<BR>
to try fermenting store bought yogurt as is.  I thought that as soon as you<BR>
chill the yogurt, it stops the fermentation process.  But I still don't know<BR>
why it works as starter.  What about other fermented products?  Would the
same<BR>
principal work? I mean, with cheeses, the longer it's left, the stronger it<BR>
gets (eg. mild, medium, or old cheddar), but if you leave it out on the<BR>
counter, it will spoil and go moldy, it won't improve and get older and<BR>
stronger.  What about wine?  Why doesn't it turn to vinegar if you leave it<BR>
out, or does it?<BR>
<BR>
So, it seems that it's some sort of chemical reaction process that must start<BR>
with boiled milk, in order to eliminate all but the right kind of bacteria.<BR>
Why doesn't someone try it, just for the heck of it, and let us know what<BR>
happens.  Personally, I have my doubts about any commercial yogurt because I<BR>
could never tolerate the homemade yogurt that I made using commercial yogurt
as<BR>
a starter, but then when I bought powedered starter, I had no problem.  This<BR>
makes me wonder if there are not some other additives in the commercial
yogurt<BR>
which are not listed, or if they are using some sort of different culture.<BR>
Something is different from the powdered, that's for sure, we just don't know<BR>
what it is.<BR>

I had a flare (I believe) using half and half with the amount of starter
prescribed for yoghurt made with regular milk.  It wasn't tart at all,
and a bit liquidy.  If your yoghurt comes out this way, feed it to your
kids or dog, but don' eat it yourself!  Add more starter, and it works
out great (I double it, like 3-4 heaping table spoons to one quart of
half &amp; half.<BR>

You asked about powdered yogurt culture.  Well, I've never ordered it myself,
since I can easily buy starter in the shops here, but I found this site where
you can order starter by mail.  The first address is the main page, and the
second one is the yogurt making supplies link.  Hope this is of some help.
<BR><BR>
By the way, for others who can't find dry curd cottage cheese or one of the

adventurous enough to attempt making it yourself, I'm sure you could acquire
the supplies necessary through the same site.<BR>

Hey Guys!<BR>
<BR>
I have a new catalogue called &quot;The Baker's Catalog&quot; that actually has some<BR>
interesting items for those on SCD (despite it being put out by a flour<BR>
company!).  They offer a yogurt maker and various starters.  I don't think<BR>
the yogurt maker would work for the diet (it's non-electric) but the starters<BR>
sounded neat.  They offer yogurt, sour cream, and buttermilk starter from<BR>
Rosell.  Evidently these are designed for use in a yogurt maker.  They also<BR>
offer a &quot;Yogurt Cheese Maker&quot; which is essentially a fine strainer that sits<BR>
in a plastic container.  You can strain 3-4 cups of yogurt and store the<BR>
resulting yogurt cheese in the container.  They also offer almond flour but<BR>
the prices on that seem really high.<BR>
<BR>
For those who are interested, their phone number is 1-800-827-6836.  They<BR>
have a web site at <A HREF="http://www.kingarthurflour.com">http://www.kingarthurflour.com</A>.  Here are the specifics on<BR>
each product discussed above.<BR>
<BR>
4206  Yogurt Cheese Maker (&quot;The Wave&quot;)  &nbsp; $19.95<BR>
4211  Yogurt Starter                            &nbsp;         $2.50<BR>
4209  Sour Cream/Buttermilk Starter           &nbsp;   $3.00<BR>
3450  Filbert Flour (unskinned hazelnuts)     &nbsp;   $4.25 for 8 oz<BR>
3496  Almond Flour (blanched almonds)       &nbsp;   $5.25 for 8 oz<BR>
<BR>
I know a lot of people get Rosell starter at health food stores, but I<BR>
thought this might be an interesting resource for those who might not have a<BR>
convenient source.  Almond flour is much cheaper than this from Hughson's.<BR>

I don't know anything about milk protein intolerance, but it would seem on
the surface that it is a different thing from lactose intolerance.  The
yogurt recommended for the diet would take care of lactose intolerance, but
not, I think, milk protein intolerance.  Although sometimes once your gut
is healed (from the SCD), you are able to tolerate proteins that previously
would irritate.<BR><BR>

At any rate, there are products available that provide a range of the
good-guy bacteria in a non-milk base.  Usually these are powders that must
be refrigerated.  They are common in healthfood stores.  My doctor has
recommended such a product in support of the effort to return my gut's
bacterial balance to normal.  Personally I use this in addition to yogurt.
<BR><BR>
So there are alternatives to yogurt.  Just make sure that the product
contains no starches or sugars.
<BR><BR>
Best of luck,

<BR>
Hi,<BR>
<BR>
To help my CD I want to try SCD without diary. This requires me to try<BR>
to get the &quot;good bacteria&quot; in other ways than the yoghurt. I got the<BR>
following recommendation from a German doctor for a therapy based on<BR>
massive amounts of &quot;good bacteria&quot;:<BR>
<BR>
Phase 1 (1 month):<BR>
  Pro-Symbioflor: Start at 2x1 drop a day and increase gradually to<BR>
    2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Lacto and Bifido (eg. SymbioLact Comp): 2 times a day<BR>
    5E8 Lactobacillus-acidophilus and 5E8 Lactobacillus-casei and<BR>
    5E8 Bifidobacterium bifidum soluted in a glass of water.<BR>
<BR>
Phase 2 (5 months):<BR>
  Pro-Symbioflor: 2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Symbioflor 1: 2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Lacto and Bifido (eg. SymbioLact Comp): 2 times a day<BR>
    5E8 Lactobacillus-acidophilus and 5E8 Lactobacillus-casei and<BR>
    5E8 Bifidobacterium bifidum soluted in a glass of water.<BR>
<BR>
Phase 3 (6 months):<BR>
  Symbioflor 1: 2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Symbioflor 2: Start at 2x1 drop a day and increase to<BR>
    2x20 drops a day.<BR>
  Lacto and Bifido (eg. SymbioLact Comp): 2 times a day<BR>
    5E8 Lactobacillus-acidophilus and 5E8 Lactobacillus-casei and<BR>
    5E8 Bifidobacterium bifidum soluted in a glass of water.<BR>
<BR>
Now this looks fine, but where do I buy this stuff:<BR>
<BR>
  Pro-Symbioflor<BR>
  Symbioflor 1<BR>
  Symbioflor 2<BR>
  SymbioLact Comp<BR>
<BR>
I am in Denmark, but I guess mail order from anywhere in Europe would be<BR>
economically okay. Maybe even from the states.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance,<BR>

(This may have some bearing on what you asked last week, Arlene.)<BR>

<BR>
<B>Why IBD sufferers should only consume UHT dairy products</B><BR>
<BR>
The standard method of pasteurization which is required by the FDA and<BR>
other public health bodies around the world is the HTST (&quot;High<BR>
Temperature Short Time&quot;) pasteurization method. The HTST pasteurization<BR>
method kills most bacteria, by heating milk to a temperature of 71.7<BR>
degrees centigrade for 15 seconds. However, research has shown that at<BR>
least three pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria are capable of<BR>
surviving HTST pasteurization. These bacteria are Mycobacterium<BR>
paratuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica.<BR>
<BR>
Mycobacterium paratuberculosis causes a chronic intestinal disease in<BR>
many animal species. This disease, which is almost identical to Crohns<BR>
disease in humans, is called Johnes disease, and affects primates<BR>
(monkeys, apes, etc), farm animals (cows, sheep, horses, goats,<BR>
chickens, pigs, etc), domestic pets (dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea-pigs,<BR>
gerbils, etc) and wild animals (deer, wild rabbits, llamas, etc). There<BR>
is strong evidence that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is responsible<BR>
for some cases of Crohns disease in humans. See the page &quot;Does<BR>
Mycobacterium paratuberculosis cause Crohns disease?&quot; for more<BR>
information.<BR>
<BR>
Yersinia enterocolitica can cause fever, abdominal pain and diarrhoea in<BR>
humans. Listeria monocytogenes causes a food poisoning disease in<BR>
humans, called listeriosis, which can be fatal in up to 30% of people<BR>
who are infected with it.<BR>
<BR>
The same risk exists for dairy products made from milk that has only<BR>
been HTST pasteurized. Such products include cheese, cream, butter,<BR>
chocolate, yoghurt, etc.<BR>
<BR>
If these pathogenic bacteria are known to be capable of surviving HTST<BR>
pasteurization, then there is a risk that other pathogenic bacteria are<BR>
able to survive it also. For sufferers of Inflammatory Bowel Disease<BR>
(both Crohns disease and Ulcerative Colitis) this is an unnecessary<BR>
risk. The intestines of IBD sufferers are inflamed, if their disease is<BR>
active, and it is almost certain that infection with potentially disease<BR>
causing bacteria will make the symptoms of IBD far worse. Thus,<BR>
sufferers of IBD should minimize their risk of infection with these<BR>
organisms. Also, for a proportion of sufferers of Crohns disease, there<BR>
is evidence that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is involved in causing<BR>
their disease.<BR>
<BR>
<B>UHT pasteurization of milk</B><BR>
<BR>
The UHT (&quot;Ultra High Temperature&quot;) pasteurization process uses a much<BR>
higher temperature than HTST pasteurization. UHT milk is &quot;superheated&quot;<BR>
to a temperature of 130 degrees centigrade (water boils at 100 degrees<BR>
centigrade). It is important to note that UHT processing does not<BR>
involve treatment with radiation. See the reference &quot;UHT processing of<BR>
milk&quot; for a description of the UHT pasteurization process. The UHT<BR>
process is virtually guaranteed to destroy all bacteria, including<BR>
Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes. Thus, by<BR>
switching to UHT milk and derivative dairy products, sufferers of IBD<BR>
can reduce their risk of infection with pathogenic bacteria, thus<BR>
increasing the chances of their disease<BR>
remaining under control.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Where can I get UHT dairy products?</B><BR>
<BR>
UHT milk, sometimes known as &quot;Long Life&quot; milk, is widely available in<BR>
Europe. Dairy products that require a long shelf life, such as the<BR>
little &quot;jiggers&quot; of milk/cream that McDonalds supply for coffee, are<BR>
usually UHT processed. Cartons of UHT milk for sale in stores will have<BR>
the phrases &quot;UHT&quot;, &quot;UHT Pasteurized&quot;, &quot;Long Life&quot;, or &quot;Longer Life&quot;<BR>
prominently displayed on them. Cream that has been UHT pasteurized is<BR>
also widely available.<BR>
<BR>
If your local store does not stock UHT milk or cream, call your local<BR>
dairy company/companies and ask them if they produce UHT products, and<BR>
if they do, to what stores do they supply them in your local area? If<BR>
they do not produce UHT products, ask them if they know of another dairy<BR>
company that does. See the page &quot;UHT dairy products&quot; for a list of UHT<BR>
products, organized by country, and companies that produce them, with<BR>
contact details.<BR>
<BR>
I have not come across any brand of cheese that is made from UHT<BR>
pasteurized milk. If you wish to eat cheese, it should be heated to a<BR>
temperature high enough to kill any bacteria in it. The temperature of<BR>
boiling water, 100 degrees C (212 degrees F), should be sufficient to<BR>
destroy any bacteria in cheese. Thus, grilling cheese under direct heat<BR>
for a few minutes(so that it &quot;bubbles&quot;), or cooking it in oven-baked<BR>
meals, such as oven-baked lasagne, should effectively &quot;home-pasteurize&quot;<BR>
the cheese.<BR>

Great Question regarding the residual Mycobacterium Paratuberculosis (a
bacteria which casues a condition identical to CD in many mammels) present in
yogurt after heating (boiling) and fermentation.  I too have been very curious
to find this out.<BR><BR>

According to research studies, (<A HREF="http://iol.ie/%7ealank/CROHNS/uhtmilk.htm">http://iol.ie/~alank/CROHNS/uhtmilk.htm</A>ParaTB pages:- Why IBD
sufferers should only ...).  Only after UHT (Ultra-High Temperature)
pastuerized milk is there no evidence of live M. Paratuberculosis present.
Normal Dairy or HTST pasturized dairy has between a 5% and 25% incident rate
of M. Paratuberculosis presence.<BR><BR>

The tempurature necessary to eradicate M. Paratuberculosis has been estimated
to be 130 degrees C (266 degrees F).  This is the temperature of UHT
pasturization.  We do not come close to this temperature in our heating prior
to fermentation for our yogurt.  So in addition to M. Paratuberculosis, other
residual pathogens may survive.  Perhaps using UHT milk to make our yogurt is
the way to go.  Has anyone tried this?<BR><BR>

Season Greeting to ALL on the List<BR>
Prateeksha

<P>Some time ago I had explained on this list how to  control the heat when
using a crock-pot or any other electrical heating devices  when making
yogurt.

<P> I have used this method for over four years now and it will control your
crock pot to with in one or two degrees, depending on how carefully you set
it.

<P>Buy one regular type  dimmer switch  that you can plug into a 110-120 volt
wall receptacle, from most any hardware dept, in any of the large chain
stores.  This small unit is normally used to plug a table lamp into and
allows one to (adjust) or  dim the light. Instead of plugging you light into
the dimmer switch you plug your crock pot into it, allowing you to control
the heat to exactaly where you want it, giving you exellent yoghurt each
time.<BR>
After setting it up for the first time using water only , you will get an
indication of where to set the adjustment knob on the dimmer switch ,mark
the point with small marking pen. It might take acouple of tries to get it
perfect so stick with just water, untill you are happy with the temperature.
If you have any question just give me a shout. This is a very  simple and
effective manner to control temperature of most any small heating or
lighting device.

<P>A simple method to check the accuracy of your thermometer is to take your
own body temperature (under the tongue of course), on a normal day.

<P>&gt;The crock-pot on low an effective way to make it?  It<BR>
&gt;seems somewhat tricky.    Val<BR>

Hi There<BR>
Do not use milk powder for your yoghurt. Stick with regular milk and you can
thicken it up
by adding half and half to you milk, or use all half and half. It will
become very thick by using any of the rich milks.<BR>

Subject:<B> Intolerance of Yoghurt/Start-up Diet</B><BR>
<P>Eileen,
<P>Just a word of warning to you and any others starting out on the diet about
yoghurt. It is recommended to eat lots of homemade yoghurt as one of the
basic foods when starting out on the diet. I did this and couldn't
understand why my symptoms got gradually worse. I eliminated the yoghurt
and things immediately got better. I had started the diet once previously
and failed to identify this intolerance, so beware. I did read earlier on
the List that some people couldn't tolerate yoghurt, but didn't think it
applied to me! (I wonder how common this intolerance is?) I'm told yoghurt
is very mucus forming. 
<P>I've been back on the diet 2 weeks and I'm living on chicken soup, chicken
soup and chicken soup! With added carrots, turnips, zucchini, small amount
of onion, celery and mixed herbs. It tastes good. I use organic produce if
at all possible. I simmer the stew for a good while to make sure all the
ingredients are soft and easily digestible. I did try pureeing the veg but
I found it made it very bland and boring.
<P>I also eat rabbit stew, cod cooked in butter and shrimps as a change from
chicken. I tried a smoked shoulder of ham but the fibres remain very tough
no matter how much you boil it.  For dessert,  jelly made with grape or
pear juice, honey and the odd ripe banana. 
<P>For snacks I sometimes buy sliced ox tongue from my local supermarket - I
checked the ingredients and there are no banned substances added; but be
careful because sometimes in small shops tongue is sold out of a can with
all sorts of disallowables in it. 
<P>Does anyone have any ideas of what sweet snacks one can make at start-out:
honey + what?

 yogurt.
<BR>I've never had any problems with it.
