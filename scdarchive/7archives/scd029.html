&gt;         Hi Everybody!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;         I am curious to see if anyone else is experiencing rather<BR>
&gt;         severe headaches.  I've been on the diet for almost three<BR>
&gt;         months now with great success.  In fact, I am finally off<BR>
&gt;         of prednisone for only the second time in ten years.  It<BR>
&gt;         only took me 2 months to taper off while strictly following<BR>
&gt;         the diet as opposed to almost two years the first time with<BR>
&gt;         out it.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;         Anyway, I keep getting just blinding headaches off and on.<BR>
&gt;         Perhaps it is due to the prednisone withdrawal, but I also<BR>
&gt;         wonder if something is going on as a result of the diet.<BR>
&gt;         Like many others on our group I have had some pretty odd<BR>
&gt;         things happening, like sensitive teeth for a good example.<BR>
&gt;         I don't recall ever having headaches coming off of pred-<BR>
&gt;         nisone.  Worse still I can't take any Advil or aspirin to<BR>
&gt;         help.  Perhaps some of you know a good alternative? (And<BR>
&gt;         I tried willow bark feverfew and it did not do a thing).<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;         I'll be interested to hear your feedback :)<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt;         Thanks,<BR>

Hi Christina,<BR>
<BR>
As one of the fellow scd-ers who has experienced the bizarre symptoms, I<BR>
sympathize with you.  The only advice I share comes from an alternative<BR>
perspective.  My husband practices naturopathic medicine and he says<BR>
that headaches like that can come from the liver processing a heavy<BR>
toxic load (which I think you've probably already mention you've also<BR>
heard before). <BR>
<BR>
If that is the case for you, short of seeing an alternative<BR>
practitioner, a thing you can try that is harmless and relatively<BR>
inexpensive is to go to your natural foods store and pick up a good<BR>
anti-oxidant supplement.  I recommend grape seed extract -- it's one of<BR>
the most powerful antioxidants (better than, say, beta-carotene).  The<BR>
supplement will help the liver process the extra toxic load, if that's<BR>
what's contributing to the headaches.<BR>
<BR>
The other thing, I actually just heard yesterday from a girlfriend who<BR>
has migraines, is that the oils in nuts really contributes to her having<BR>
headaches.  If you're like me, you're eating more nuts now on the diet<BR>
than you ever ate regularly in your life.  Anyway, that's just something<BR>
I heard. <BR>
<BR>
I know that since I have been on the diet, I have had to take more<BR>
anti-oxidants than before.  This doesn't quite make sense to me, since<BR>
my leaky gut is apparently healing!  But the anti-oxidants have really<BR>
helped my energy and take care of some of the little headaches I've had.<BR>
I personally have no idea why these kinds of symptoms come up and wish I<BR>
knew.  I'd be curious to hear what ends up helping yours.<BR>
<BR>
For what it's worth, those are my two cents!  I'm certainly not trying<BR>
to play doctor here, but I wish you luck!<BR>
<BR>
By the way, congratulations on getting off of prednisone! <BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Denise<BR>

hi christina <BR>
<BR>
regarding the severe headaches you are experiencing ..i too came off of<BR>
prednisone last year after taking the drug for aprox 10years at 5mg per
day<BR>
.   <BR>
i experienced severe headaches as well as severe backaches and hip pain
..<BR>
i had never had arthritic pain previously (ive had cd for 16 years ) and
i<BR>
beleive the pain was contributed to the fact i stopped the prednisone .
 as<BR>
i was not on the diet at that time ,ive only recently discovered the diet<BR>
.and since i have been following the diet i have never had any headaches<BR>
.altough recently had the hip problem again .<BR>
the pain i was experiencing last year lasted aprox 1 month and didnt<BR>
actually start until 2 months after stopping the prednisone ...i took advil<BR>
at the time <BR>
oh well best of luck ..hopefully the pain will subside soon ...<BR>
<BR>
