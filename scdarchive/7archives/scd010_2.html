<BR>
I hope Elaine won't mind, but here's what is in the new edition (May 1996
Printing) of her book. I kept seeing so many requests about this on the
list, I figured I may as well just type the whole thing in:<BR>
<BR>
It has been advised on pages 44 and 45 that you should try to find a source
of dry curd cottage cheese. This type of cheese is known by different names
throughout the world. In some regions it is called &quot;farmer's cheese&quot;
while in other areas, it it is called &quot;baker's cheese.&quot; No matter
what it is called, it shares certain characteristics: <BR>
1) It is a white dry curd which has not had additional fluid added to it;
<BR>
2) Since it has been separated from the lactose-rich whey and has been treated
with a bacterial culture which eliminates residual lactose, its lactose
content is negligible (about 1%). IN some areas it is packed in plastic
bags while in other places it is packed in containers containing about one
cup. [in Vancouver it is found in larger plastic tubs like yogurt in the
grocery store's dairy case]. Sometimes it can be purchased in larger containers
which can be divided into suitable serving sizes and frozen to be taken
out of the freezer as it is needed.<BR>
<BR>
One of the Canadian producers of this product, Western Dairy (Western Creamery),
not only distributes throughout parts of Canada, but also ships to parts
of the USA. Western Dairy manufactures one of their products without the
coagulating enzyme, rennin, which makes it suitable for the Muslim and Orthodox
Jewish communities.<BR>

<P><B>Cotttage cheese</B><BR>
<BR>
&gt;Can you tell me the difference between the cottage cheese found at every<BR>
&gt;supermarket and dry curd cottage cheese mentioned in the book? <BR>
&gt;Maybe I don't have a problem afterall. Rick<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rick,<BR>
Look in the dairy section of the supermarket. Where do you live, by the
way? <BR>
Anyway, read the labels on the containers of cottage cheeses. Normally there
are several different kinds available such as creamed, low-fat, etc. Most
of these kinds are illegal on our diet. What you want should be labelled
&quot;dry curd&quot;. If you look at it, it looks dry, there is no milky,
creamy, liquidyness to it. But it comes in the same type of container that
regular cottage cheeses do. Look carefully, and if you don't see it, ask
to speak to the manager and request that they carry it. It never hurts to
ask, and you may not be required to buy a whole case after all. Give it
a shot.<BR>
<BR>
Anna<BR>
<BR>
I've found two different brands and they are both packaged in small plastic
bags instead of normal cottage cheese containers. The first I found at the
health food store which did not surprise me, but I stumbled onto the second
at a regular super market. <BR>
It was a regular mainstream dairy brandname, which suggests to me that it
would be possible to have your friendly neighborhood supermarket special-order
it for you if you can't find it at a health food store.<BR>
<BR>
Judy<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Friendship Dairies&quot; manufactures a product that comes in a 7.5
ounce serving, wrapped in plastic. I called the company--the number is listed
in the book--and spoke with someone who assured me that the the product
was<BR>
prepared in accordance with the diet. I buy it at Met Food or Key Food in<BR>
Brooklyn.<BR>
<BR>
I just got a letter from the Friendship company in response to a letter
I wrote asking if there was any lactose in their product.<BR>
It listed the following for Friendship Farmer Cheese<BR>
Total Fat: 2.5g<BR>
<DD>Saturated Fat: 1.5g<BR>
Cholesterol: 10mg<BR>
Sodium: 120mg<BR>
Total Carbohydrate: 0g<BR>
<DD>Dietary Fiber: 0g<BR>
<DD>Sugars: 0g<BR>
Protein: 5g<BR>
<BR>
I guess lactose and sugar are the same thing. If anyone else wants to<BR>
write to them the address is:<BR>
Friendship Dairies Incorporated<BR>
PO Box 217<BR>
Maspeth, N.Y. 11378<BR>
<BR>
I found this cheese in Austin, Texas and I'm trying to get the grocers<BR>
here in San Antonio to stock it. So far they just don't want to be<BR>
bothered.<BR>

<B>Dry Curd Cottage Cheese (DCCC)  </B><BR> 
 Fri, 10 Jan 1997 18:28:27 GMT<BR><BR>

 Renay, I feel your pain!  I live right near Wash, D.C. and have 
     searched all over for dry curd cottage cheese, without success.  I 
     wish Elaine had lived somewhere other than the NYC area so she was 
     forced to find another product years ago!   Is anyone making bread 
     with any other product than DCCC or cheddar cheese?  The bread with 
     cheddar is O.K., but pretty 'low.'  I use three thin slices in my 
     morning French toast.<BR><BR>
     
     Breakstone makes a DCCC but then adds skim milk to make it wet.  I've 
     been rinsing it in a strainer with water, but in her last 
     communication Elaine said I should keep trying to find proper DCCC.<BR><BR>

     People,<BR>
If you can't find the dry curd cottage cheese, you can still make a bread which
is very good, and similar to the &quot;Lois Lang Luscious Bread&quot;.  Go to the fromt
of the Gourmet section in the book.  There is a recipe called &quot;Basic Bread and
Muffins&quot;.  There are several variations to the recipe, listed right after the
recipe instructions I believe.  Some people actually prefer this bread to the
DCCC one, because it is lighter. I don't have the book with me at the moment,
but I think when you are making bread rather than muffins, you add an extra
egg.  Butter the loaf pan well, and sprinkle some nut flour in the bottom
before spooning the batter into the pan.<BR>

A local health food stores indicated that they can ship day  a Dry Curd
Nonfat Cottage Cheese (frozen at time of shipment). Cost US dollars 3.50 (net wt
16oz.-1 lb) + shipping charges to any place in the US (via next day delivery).<BR><BR>

Please let me know if you are interested and I will give you their phone number<BR><BR>

&gt;In New Zealand we have a product called &quot;QUARK&quot; 2% lactose
product.<BR>
&gt;This is the only thing I can find that comes close to the dry curd<BR>
&gt;cheese mentioned. Is this acceptable ? Elaine mentions 1% lactose<BR>
&gt;as being acceptable.<BR></TT>
<BR>
I would call Elaine if I were you, and ask her.  Otherwise you can use strained 
homemade yogurt, as is suggested in the book.<BR>

Hi Bart. <BR>
I get my DCCC from Seward's in Vermont  (tel. 802/259-2311) 
and they're great about UPS'ing it. I don't know if that's 
work well for you in the summer months, but it's be fine in the fall/winter,
I 
imagine. I get 5 lbs, plus shipping, for about $9, and I freeze the excess.<BR>
Lasts quite a while with no waste!<BR>

With regard to trying to find a source in the UK of dry curd cheese, I will 
carry on searching for a few more days. (Since all hard pressed cheese is 
made from curd with the whey is drained off I am a little confused as to
what 
is special about a DRY curd cheese). For those that have an interest in 
cheese making there is a simple article at<BR>

<B>DCCC </B><BR>
Mon, 10 Mar 1997 19:29:38 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Don't worry if you can't find DCCC in your area.  Just do without it.  I
can<BR>
get it where I live at practically every supermarket, but I hardly ever
get it<BR>
anymore because I don't want to finish the tub.  The reason Elaine says
&quot;every<BR>
effort should be made to find it&quot; is because it is a good source of
protien<BR>
besides meat or eggs and is easily digestible for SCDers.  I think that's
the<BR>
only reason.  The truth of the matter is that it is not imperative to the
diet<BR>
at all.  You can easily have a well varied SCDiet without ever laying eyes
on<BR>
the DCCC.  If you found it, you wouldn't be that impressed.  It basically
has<BR>
no flavour, is dry and boring.  I like it once in a while, but if I never
saw<BR>
it again, I wouldn't really mind.  I don't think it has any special properties<BR>
like the homemade yogurt that we eat, which make it necessary for success
on<BR>
the diet.  Basically I think Elaine just includes it for varieties sake.
 It is<BR>
just one more allowable food on the SCD.  But if you couldn't get apples
(for<BR>
example) where you live, you could do without them, and still follow the
diet<BR>
no problem.  I really think what Elaine meant was that everyone should at
least<BR>
make an EFFORT to find the DCCC, but if you can't get it where you live,
relax,<BR>
and forget it.  If you can special order it, as one person said, I would<BR>
recommend that you give it a try - at least once.  Then you can decide if
you<BR>
really want it.  For the person who asked how it is made, it is actually
just<BR>
cottage cheese.   When the milk curdles in the cheese making process, you
get<BR>
curds and whey. (Like little miss muffit)  The whey is drained off and you
have<BR>
curds remaining.  This is the DCCC.  The cottage cheese that most people
buy<BR>
which is readily available simply has cream and salt added to it.  As for<BR>
Farmer's cheese, I have no idea if it's the same as DCCC, but from the<BR>
description of the last person who mentioned it (a solid block) it doesn't<BR>
sound like it.  Anyway, I hope this advice helps someone.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Re: DCCC</B><BR>
<BR>
Hello, <BR>
Just my two cents on DCCC:  I can get it near me, but I don't get it very<BR>
often because it's expensive, doesn't taste that great, and I don't miss
it<BR>
when I don't have it.   The main reason I see for getting the DCCC is to<BR>
make the &quot;Lois Lang&quot; bread recipe, a really good bread that I
can use for<BR>
sandwiches.   I like the bread and I *really* like having a sandwich, but<BR>
it takes a fair amount of work to make a single loaf of bread that makes<BR>
just a few sandwiches.   (Since the bread doesn't rise, I cut it sideways<BR>
to get normal size slices - so it doesn't last me long).   I find that the<BR>
muffins are much easier to make, and give me a lot more food servings for<BR>
the trouble.    (I also find that if I have more than two muffins or nut<BR>
breads in a day, I seem to have more discomfort and trouble with BMs - so<BR>
making muffins once or twice a week is plenty for me.)<BR>
<BR>
So, for me, it's a lot better use of time to make yogurt and muffins once<BR>
or twice a week and forget the bread (and therefore, forget the DCCC). <BR>
Instead of sandwiches, I eat a salad with chicken, tuna, turkey or cheese<BR>
on top, and a muffin on the side.    <BR>
<BR>
As far as salads, I bought one of those Good Seasons salad dressing carafes<BR>
that comes with the flavor packet.  The carafe has markings on the side
for<BR>
how much vinegar, oil and water to use, so it's really simple to make a<BR>
consistently tasty dressing.   I throw away the flavor packet and add my<BR>
own ingredients, usually garlic, oregane, basil, parsley, honey, salt and<BR>
pepper.  Sometimes I add a little mustard and extra honey.   The dressing<BR>
is delicious.   For salads, I started buying the pre-packaged (so-called<BR>
&quot;European-style&quot;) bags of prepared lettuce mixes at Safeway. 
  It's<BR>
definitely more expensive, but if I want a salad, it takes me about a<BR>
minute and tastes great.    I've been averaging more than one salad per<BR>
day, and I feel it really balances my diet.   (Of course, some of us may
be<BR>
unable to tolerate the leafy greens, but I have no problems, and they offer<BR>
excellent nutritional benefits.)<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to all.<BR>
<BR>

Hello,<BR>
The people who run the store where I've bought DCCC seem very knowledgeable<BR>

<BR>
YES, you can freeze Dry Curd Cottage Cheese.  Elaine says so in the book,
and I<BR>
have done it myself.<BR>
<BR>
RAW milk means unpasteurized, but you can probably use pasteurized just
as<BR>
well.  Raw milk is very hard to get unless you live near a cow.<BR>

     Several new people have asked about dry curd cottage cheese.  We all <BR>
     have to go through this in the beginning, as it is not a common item <BR>
     in many parts of the country/world.<BR>
     <BR>
     I have successfully ordered it from Seward's Store in Vermont.  The <BR>
     number is 802/259-2311.  Just call and order it in one or more five <BR>
     pound plastic containers.  They will bill later!  It is very <BR>
     inexpensive.  I decant it into one-cup plastic yogurt cups and freeze <BR>
     for later use.  It freezes very well for use in the Laing bread.<BR>

Since people are always bringing this subject up, I thought I'd pass along 
a source for this elusive product. This store is in San Francisco, but they 
will ship it frozen. I buy it for $2.09 per lb, and it goes by the name of 
baker's cheese. The owner's name is Mario. This is the place:<BR>

415 Divisadero<BR>
San Francisco,CA 94117<BR>
