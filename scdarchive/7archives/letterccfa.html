        </font><font face="Arial" size=2> 
        </font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size=2><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am writing to request 
        that the CCFA acknowledge and strive to publicize alternative treatments 
        with which patients can achieve controlled remission of Crohnís Disease 
        and Ulcerative Colitis. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was diagnosed with 
        Crohnís Disease in 1981. For sixteen years I suffered through pain, weight 
        loss, and diarrhea -- even while I was taking medications such as Prednisone, 
        Azulfidine, 6-MP, and Asacol. Dissatisfied with the lack of consistent 
        results from the prescribed traditional treatments, I went to the Internet 
        for information. For example, that is how I learned of the Specific Carbohydrate 
        Diet (SCD).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For nearly 3 years 
        I have been following the SCD and have been off medication. I have gained 
        weight. I now have regular bowel movements. I do not have pain or cramping. 
        In fact, over a year ago I went in for a colonoscopy. My doctor said, 
        &quot;We got all the way to the cecum. You have no evidence at all of 
        Crohnís. No scars. No inflammation. Nothing. You look completely normal."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To my knowledge there 
        are hundreds, perhaps thousands of patients that have achieved a controlled 
        remission of their IBD with the SCD. This diet is based on research of 
        Dr. S. V. Haas and Elaine Gottschall. Over 250 of us worldwide subscribe 
        to an email listserve where we share testimonials, success stories, recipes, 
        questions, and answers. New subscribers constantly indicate their gastroenterologist 
        is &quot;not familiar with the SCD&quot;. My own doctor said he was not 
        familiar with the diet and was intrigued by my success.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I wish my doctors 
        had told me about alternative treatments! I wonder: are they unaware of 
        the alternative treatments, or do they lack sufficient confidence in these 
        options and therefore donít mention them? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My experience indicates 
        that the alternative treatments are not appropriate for everyone at all 
        stages of their illness. Nevertheless, I believe that you and your member 
        MDís should acknowledge and make patients aware of their options. Imagine 
        the detrimental long-term effects of drugs that could be avoided! Imagine 
        the hundreds, probably thousands of surgeries that could be avoided!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Patients look to you 
        for guidance. I believe your membership would increase by acknowledging 
        alternative medicine. I implore you to provide information regarding the 
        success I and so many others have found with alternative treatments such 
        as the SCD. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
