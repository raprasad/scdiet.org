I am slowly coming to the conclusion that the SCD diet, which has given
me my life back <BR>
in many ways, controls the symptoms of UC, but won't cure me. Therefore,
I am THINKING <BR>
of staying on the diet, med-free for 11 months a year, then taking prednisone
and <BR>
asuphazaline for 1 month (or maybe only 2 weeks a year) and treating myself
to daily <BR>
doses of things like Pizza, Ice cream, Beer, Chocolate, bread, rice, pasta,
cake, <BR>
etc.....<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone else feel that they are never going to get fully better, and
that a brief <BR>
time off the diet, with the help of medication, for a short enough period
so as not to <BR>
screw up one's metabolism won't set them back? I base this on the fact that
I've had <BR>
mild relapses, and with the diet, they have sort of gone away (but never
completely, <BR>
except for the occasional day). I believe that I am being extremely strict
in avoiding <BR>
complex carbohydrates...<BR>

I found your posting very interesting. My son (12) has been on the diet
for<BR>
about a year and has done extremely well and has been able to stop all<BR>
medications except for cortenema. We recently had a doctor's appointment
and<BR>
did a couple of hemocult cards to check for microscopic blood in the stool.<BR>
Both samples came back positive which led me to believe that though the
diet<BR>
has helped immensely I am beginning to question whether or not it could<BR>
actually cure my son of Crohn's. <BR>
<BR>
We are fairly rigid with his diet although he has been caught cheating a
few<BR>
times . . after all, he is just a child and hasn't been able to always resist<BR>
temptation at school when a classmate offered something that he really wanted<BR>
to eat. <BR>
<BR>
Your suggestion of taking meds for short periods and enjoying a normal diet<BR>
has crossed my mind in that I'm not so sure that my son will be willing
to<BR>
live under the diet restrictions for the remainder of his life. Of course,<BR>
prednisone and it's problems aren't much of a choice either. One of our
main<BR>
problems (blessings!) is that my son has not suffered with his disease the<BR>
way many of the members of this group have. He had severe nausea, terrible<BR>
&quot;D&quot;, blood loss, but no pain to speak of and all symptoms can
be controlled<BR>
with meds. When he does cheat on the diet, he doesn't experience any pain
or<BR>
discomfort but will have his stools loosen up and show visible blood loss.<BR>
The frequency doesn't even always increase. Needless to say, this doesn't<BR>
act as a great deterrant for not cheating on the diet. The threat of having<BR>
to go back on prednisone and blow up like the Goodyear blimp and suffer
the<BR>
teasing of the kids at school seems to have more of an effect on him.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for rattling on so but this subject has been on my mind ever since
we<BR>
got the results of the hemocult cards. Any other viewpoints would be<BR>
appreciated.<BR>

I've received a few responses to this my posting, and have decided that<BR>
it's a nice fantasy, but Id rather not run the risk of setting myself<BR>
back 3 months, which could happen, with or without medication. I forgot<BR>
just what it was like to be REALLY sick, or all puffed out on<BR>
prednisone....<BR>
<BR>
Thanks everyone for the support. I'm back on the wagon (well, I never<BR>
actually stepped off...)<BR>

Dear Barb,<BR>
<BR>
You say your son has been on the diet for about 1 year and has been able
to<BR>
stop all medications except for cortenema. That is truly wonderful, and<BR>
like Elaine advises in her book, once the last symptom has gone a person<BR>
should stay on the diet strictly for at least one year. I am sure at that<BR>
time things would look much better for anyone having any type of test. We<BR>
hope with Martine to do just that, wait one full year after her last symptom<BR>
before even thinking about eating any food not allowed on the SCD. In fact<BR>
I was just speaking with Elaine last night , she called to see how Martine<BR>
was doing and although she is much improved she still has a way to go. But<BR>
like Elaine says its slow progress and that is good enough for me. At least<BR>
Martine has a life now which she did not this time last year. Martine was<BR>
very ill to the point that her Dr. wanted to remove her colon. The diet
has<BR>
very much helped to settle her disease activity (and save her colon) and
to<BR>
put 25lbs back on, which was very much needed. Her blood work continues
to<BR>
improve monthly. We know its the diet because she has tried everything else<BR>
with no results. I don't know how old your son is but I know it must be<BR>
difficult at school. Martine is 19 , so sticking to the diet with fanatical<BR>
adherence has never been a problem. I guess what I am trying to say is that<BR>
I firmly believe that SCD will cure Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis if<BR>
followed as strickly as Elaine recommonds. The time period is different<BR>
for everyone depending on how sick the person is. Hope this helps. Keep<BR>
Positive!<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
Barb Partridge <BR>

<BR>
		Hi All,<BR>
<BR>
		Just read the posting on remission and decided to put it my two<BR>
		cents worth.<BR>
<BR>
		I started the diet in desperation at the beginning of January in<BR>
		the middle of a bad flare while I was on 40 mgs of prednisone.  I<BR>
		was amazed at how well the diet worked and went flying off the meds<BR>
		as fast as I could.  By the end of March I was completely off of<BR>
		prednisone for only the second time in ten years.  Five weeks later<BR>
		I was sick as a dog again and this past week I've been back on 30<BR>
		mgs.  My guess is I didn't taper slowly enough and give my adrenal<BR>
		glands a chance to kick in.  This, at least, is my hope.<BR>
<BR>
		I am going to stick with the diet regardless.<BR>
<BR>
		A friend of mine made an interesting point about this diet the other<BR>
		day and likened it to &quot;dietary TPN&quot;.  Think about it.  Although
we<BR>
		aren't giving our colons a complete rest we are simplifying the work<BR>
		they have to do to digest.  Naturally this would ease symptoms.  Will<BR>
		it cure?  Who knows.  Perhaps our diseases will just continue to remit<BR>
		and flare as they always have and the scd diet becomes one more tool<BR>
		in the battle to stay functional and well, to be utilised in conjunc-<BR>
		tion with medications.  For some people perhaps it is a complete cure.<BR>
		My guess is it will vary depending on each individual, the severity<BR>
		of their disease, and their response to dietary manipulation or de-<BR>
		pendance on medication.<BR>
<BR>
		I would like to take a moment to sincerely thank every single one of<BR>
		you for all of your incredible encouragement, input, and personal<BR>
		insights that you are so willing to share as well all try to find our
<BR>
		road to health.  I for one am singularly grateful to be a part of<BR>
		our group.<BR>
<BR>
		Thanks And Good Health,<BR>

Did anyone notice on the last issue of Ibd list how Dr. Steve Holland said &quot;the
SCD diet people are not too bright&quot;.  <BR>I wonder if any of you replied to that?<BR>
I didn't, but I wanted to, so I hope someone else did.<BR>

Dr. Holland wrote:<BR>
&quot;Well, yes, a fine theory, but why a diet with the most allergenic protein

not too bright.  If they thought about what the immune response in an
allergic response is compared to what the response is in Crohn's, they
might say something halfway smart.  but there are no studies that even
suggest that the scd diet is helpful.  There are problems that respond to
parts of the diet, but those are well known and are easier to tolerate
than the scd diet.&quot;<BR><BR>

&gt; I have ulcerative colitis and have been on the diet since April 26, 1997.<BR>
&gt; I did really well and was symptom free after less than one month.  That<BR>

lasted<BR>
&gt; about three weeks.  It seems to be getting steadily worse but I can't<BR>
&gt; figure out why.  I know the book talks about a relapse after two to three<BR>
&gt; months but how long is this relapse supposed to last?  I'm on mesasol<BR>

Hello,<BR>
<BR>
Regarding the replase:  you may want to refine the diet.<BR>
<BR>
I found that I needed to eliminate foods that are &quot;OK&quot; according to<BR>
Elaine's guidelines, but *not* OK according to my experience.    Another<BR>
book, &quot;Eating Right for a Bad Gut&quot; book by Scala is a more conventional<BR>
review of what foods a UC/CD sufferer may want to avoid.   Scala has done<BR>
informal surveys of UC/CD patients to determine what foods consistently<BR>
cause problems, and some of the findings coincide with my experience,<BR>
thought they are allowed on the SCD.   Personally, I have maintained the<BR>
SCD guidelines, but I also cut out red meat, beets (including V8 juice),<BR>
some fruits, all unpeeled vegetables.    I especially want to stress the<BR>
red meat: the last three times I have tried a steak or burger, I was on my<BR>
back the next day with the usual symptoms.   These &quot;beef&quot; episodes came<BR>
during periods of relatively good health.<BR>
<BR>
I also want to make a plug for garlic capsules - I take two a day and on<BR>
days when I run out or forget, I definitely feel worse.  (Caution - garlic<BR>
is supposedly upsetting to some people with our condition.)<BR>
<BR>
I think the diet continues to be factor in my current good health.   But<BR>
I'm convinced we all must seek additional parameters based on our<BR>
experience.<BR>
<BR>
Best of luck!<BR>
<BR>

<B>Is the diet working?</B><BR>
 Wed,  9 Jul 1997 19:57:33 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Dietmar,<BR>
Just to let you know, I've been on the diet for over a year now and I<BR>
also had bleeding for about the first 2 or 3 months on the diet even<BR>
though I was following it 100%.  It was the last symptom of mine to<BR>
disappear but since my other symptoms were showing steady improvement<BR>
and the bleeding finally started decreasing I stuck with the diet.  So,<BR>
the diet may be working for you after all, you might just need to give<BR>
it some more time.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

<B>Why???</B><BR>
Sat,  5 Jul 1997  1:18:56 GMT<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Are the following forbidden on the diet?<BR>
<BR>
Elaine has said kidney beans are allowed.<BR>
The rest of things you listed, I'm not positive about.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Why are garbanzos (chick peas) forbidden, but not white beans or lentils or<BR>
&gt;split peas?  What's the principle here?<BR></FONT>
<BR>
We don't really know why in a lot of cases.  One reason I have heard is that<BR>
Elaine didn't have a chance to &quot;test out&quot; every single food known to man and<BR>
she mainly went by what the Drs. Haas told her. After all, they apparently<BR>
invented it, not her.  She is no food scientist, and she didn't even have IBD<BR>
herself.  The amount of research and work done by her just to figure out those<BR>
foods listed as allowable so far, was very extensive and labour intensive.  I<BR>
am greatful just for that alone.  I think that basically, that is the reason.<BR>
Maybe with more research, we could find out more foods we could possibly eat<BR>
and more answers as to why.  But who has time or resources for that kind of<BR>
project?  It seems the medical establishment couldn't care less about the<BR>
purported anecdotal evidence that this diet helps us.  I haven't seen anyone<BR>
rushing to do any studies, controlled trials, etc.  It seems all anyone wants<BR>
to do is dis-prove it, rather than prove it unfortunately.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Why almond milk only after 6 months?<BR></FONT>
<BR>
I found myself asking WHY to a LOT of things in this book.  Finally I gave up<BR>
and just accepted it, because usually, nobody knows why.  We can theorize, but<BR>
then again, that's what this diet is all about.  A theory.  I think almond milk<BR>
probably contains concentrated forms of carbohydrates and therefore maybe<BR>
harder to digest.  Just like you're not supposed to eat nuts at all until the<BR>
diarreah is gone.  Not everyone realizes the fact that this diet is a gradual<BR>
process of introducing things.  It's not an all or nothing type of thing.  We<BR>
are supposed to start out with limited foods that are easier to digest, and as<BR>
we get better, add a few more things, like the nuts, beans, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Let's remember the name of this diet is &quot;Specific&quot; Carbohydrate Diet.  It seems<BR>
that it's not necessarily a carbo free diet or even merely a low carbo diet.<BR>
For some reasons, mostly unknown at this time, certain carbohydrates are easier<BR>
to digest for us than others.  That's probably why some beans are yes and some<BR>
are no.  God only knows, as the saying goes.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Is there any way to communicate with Elaine directly to get authoritative<BR>
&gt;information about these kinds of details?<BR></FONT>
<BR>
I have heard that Elaine is actually very open to getting phone calls.  From<BR>
personal experience, I know she doesn't really like answering questions by fax<BR>
because it takes too long to write it all out.  She is happy to answer all your<BR>
questions on the phone.  I think her new number is 905-349-3443.  After talking<BR>
to some people, I've heard that she sometimes even phones to check on how they<BR>
are doing later on.<BR>

Regarding what Dietmar said below, this kind of thinking disturbs me. It's<BR>
too much like that of M.D.'s who prescribe their usual medicines but are<BR>
not willing to consider the SCD diet or other alternatives.<BR>
<BR>
Our diet is not a sacred religion, nor is Elaine either a Goddess or<BR>
infallible. Questioning and wanting more information on the diet's<BR>
mechanism's and principles, especially when one follows it and gets<BR>
great initial results but then deteriorates more so than the book says<BR>
will happen, is normal and desirable.<BR>
<BR>
I'm convinced I'm doing much better on the diet than I would be otherwise.<BR>
At the same time, I think we ought to be able to share our doubts and<BR>
concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Changing topics, I too read Eating Right for your Type. The author says that<BR>
as a person with type AB blood I should be able to eat dairy products, which<BR>
I can. I was wondering if Denise and others who are not able to eat yoghurt<BR>
are the type the author says should avoid dairy: type O.<BR>

The trouble is even though we strictly follow the diet, and don't eat certain<BR>
foods until we're supposed to, not all of us continue to get well, so we<BR>
want to know what changes might help, get a better understanding of the<BR>
diet's principles. etc. Does *that* make sense?<BR>

This is from Dietmar: true, you're right.  It's just that, having been an<BR>
&quot;intellectual&quot; most of my life, I find that people who &quot;think too much&quot; and<BR>
are &quot;head tripping&quot; all the time forget to &quot;get on with the job&quot; ... they<BR>
keep worrying / pondering / asking intellectual questions instead of having<BR>
a life and getting out there and DOING stuff to get results, THEN examining<BR>
and refining.  They tend to put the cart before the horse: thinking /<BR>
navel-gazing interminably and discussing tiny teeny semantics to minutae<BR>
instead of just &quot;getting with the program&quot; and seeing what happens.<BR>
<BR>
So sure, nobody would make ANY progress and find any solutions to problems<BR>
(such as ours, of IBD) if they didn't use their head, ask questions, and<BR>
think things through, but there comes a point when you're better off to<BR>
just put all that &quot;wheel-spinning&quot; on the shelf for a while and just get on<BR>
with things ... THAT was my point.<BR>

Subject: <B>thoughts on scd</B><BR><BR>

Dear People,<BR><BR>

Here are some thoughts driven into daylight by recent discussions of Dr.
Holland, the SCD, who we are, etc.<BR><BR>

1.  Those who write in Dr. Holland's tone of voice are should probably not be
answered: they are looking for a fight; they are ignorant of the object of
their rage; they are operating in passion.  A useful response to such people
is silence (but I know that's no help to one's own rage, sparked by theirs!).<BR><BR>

2.  People who claim the SCD cannot work (e.g., Holland) because it advises
all the usual &quot;bad&quot; foods (animal fat, fruits, vegetables), speak according
to decades of mainstream medical wisdom.  This &quot;wisdom&quot; is so established in
American and Canadian culture, that ordinary folk &quot;intuitively&quot; suppose that
if bowels are the trouble, then fat and fruit and vegetables must be avoided.
&quot;Easy to digest&quot; foods, lke bread and rice, must be reached for.   Many with
IBD, who are not on the SCD diet, swear that it is precisely fats, fruit, and
vegetables, , plus milk and eggs, that give them trouble.  No doubt that is
true.  What is omitted, in a contxt of controversy with SCD, is that fats and
fruits and vegetables will work nicely for many IBD sufferers, but *only* if
the complete diet is followed. Fuits and vegetables are going to give trouble
if consumed with breads and sugars.<BR><BR>

3.  Another claim against the SCD is that if total nutritional feeding (by
tube) cannot work to cure, or even halt, IBD, then the SCD must be founded on
false premises, leading to false promises.  Again, the total picture is
missing.  For one thing, the SCD takes a very long time to show its strength.
 After a first major improvement, let's say in 3-4 weeks, progress is
sometimes distrerssingly slow; reaching an even plane of really good health
takes a minimum of two years for many--and even longer. This time-frame is
often ignored by those hostile to the diet and given to making comparisons.
Moreover, the tube-fed substances have in them I know not what substances
(chemically speaking), but I'm willing to be they include some carbohydrates
prohibited on the SCD diet.<BR><BR>

I have Crohn's Disease and have been on the diet for 8+ months.  I had a
major set-back at 3 months (my disease read Gottschall's book!), and many
dips downward since then, but the general graph goes upward, without a doubt.<BR><BR>


Patience, ah patience!<BR><BR>

Dear Anna,<BR>
I'm surprised you missed my own rather harsh critiscism of Dr. Holland, but
I was having trouble getting through, so I'll repeat it for you.<BR><BR>

this from Mac<BR><FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;My only contact with Dr. Steve Holland has been on the IBD list and reading<BR>
&gt;his comments that were causing many IBD patients a lot of concern.<BR>
&gt;I felt that his answers  were thorough, articulate, and professional. He<BR>
&gt;offered his opinion pro bono in a honest and non scarey form to IBD Digest<BR>
&gt;audience.<BR>
&gt;<BR><BR></FONT>
Dear Mac,<BR>
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and much of what you say about
Doctors being in a highly litigious situation has merit, however Dr.
Holland in his remarks does not simply dismiss the SCD as unscientific. He
belittles and mocks those of us who have been reborn to health, as idiots.
I for one am sick unto death of Doctors who think that their education
places them on a godly pedestal with the right to treat us common folk as
fools, unable to think or seek answers. I went to a new rhuematoligist this
week, liked her a lot, but what impressed me most was her interest in my
diet, her willingness to research it for the benefit of some of her
patients and for her remark &quot; As you well know, we doctors have no clue
when it comes to treating IBD&quot;. How exquistitely refreshing.
&quot;He offered his opinion pro bono&quot;<BR>
Sorry, Mac, but what you might veiw as altruism in Dr. Holland's motive, I
suspect is ego-fest.<BR>
Meanwhile, I continue to seek answers from sources who want to help, to
work with me and not make me to feel as though they consider themselves
above me.<BR>
Currently, my UC is and has been in remission for over 2 years, thanks to
SCD. Unfortunately the other auto-immune diseases that I have, which are
linked to this, spondylitis and fibromyalgia are not so easy to conquer. I
search desperatly for an &quot;Elaine&quot; to throw me a lifeline in these pools of
despair in my life.<BR>
Love, Rachel<BR><BR>

      Dear All,<BR>
                    On this Dr. Holland issue , I to would like to read the
entire contents of his post. But I have no doubt he was rude , Funny thing
is I expect this kind of attitude more from the medical society than the
general population that is suffering from illness. But I have come to
understand that some people have put all their faith lock stock and barrel
in a magic pill. The diet certainly takes more self discipline than popping
a pill.<BR><BR>
         When one has invested years in steroids and other drugs it is hard to
admit to oneself that it was not the best course of treatment after all, if
a simple diet change could have helped them it makes them feel pretty dumb
for ingesting all those drugs.<BR><BR>
        Personally when I mentioned the name of the diet to my Rhumie he wanted to
hear nothing about it. But on my last visit even he had to admit when I
referred to Scd only as a special diet for people with CD, UC, Celiac etc.
that is sure did seem to be working for me. And that I would be best to
stick with it. Of course he takes no part in recommending it or wanting to
even look at the book. You know what they say old habits die hard.<BR><BR>
        I think we need to look at it as a mission to reach one person at a time
and someday there will be enough of us that they will no longer be able to
ignore us. Here is a little secret that helps me. Pray for them , turn the
other cheek, and rest in the knowledge that you are finding your way to
good health. Think of all the people that have not even heard of the Scd
diet or any of the others that help so many. Make it your own little
mission to help one person a year. Buy an extra copy of Elaine 's book and
share it with another sufferer.<BR><BR>

Subject: <B>holland comments on ibdlist</B><BR><BR>

I have received a few posts from people who think I was wrong to say what I did
on the IBDlist towards Holland.  I know that I should have ignored him, but I
have been doing that for at least a year now, and him calling us &quot;not too
bright&quot; and saying that maybe if we knew anything we would say something
&quot;halfway smart&quot;, was the last straw for me.  He has been monopolizing that list
with his slanted input far too long, to the detriment of people who might have
at least tried the diet if it weren't for him.  As a physician, I think he is
completely unprofessional.  I have no respect for a doctor who makes unwelcome,
insulting remarks like that on a public forum.  I know my so called &quot;flame&quot;
won't do the SCD or the IBDlist any good.  But I don't think I'm
the only one who has had just about enough of that doctor on his high horse.  I
have been criticized for wording the response &quot;so harshly&quot;.  Tom even predicted
what would happen after those comments he made.  I'm surprised I was the only
one who replied to Holland's posts.  I wonder what it would take to get others
upset by him.  Instead of not too
bright, what if he called us stupid or idiots or lunatics?  To me, he may as
well have said all of these, because the tone of his postings regarding the SCD
have always expressed a shallow and insulting point of view.<BR><BR>

 I felt his so called &quot;apology&quot; was very insincere.  I admit I should
not have stooped to his level of insulting, however I still have no regrets,
except for the hope that I haven't impacted on the reputation of the whole SCD
community.  If anyone thinks I have made us all look bad instead of just
myself, I am willing to write a retraction to the IBDlist with the disclaimer
that my views in no way reflect what the rest of the SCDers think.

&gt;I thought that Elaine had done her homework before putting her<BR>
&gt;words into her book.<BR><BR>

Actually I think she's just dated. She uses a 1951 study to back up her
cured statement. Gluten being the cause of celiac disease was announced to
the world in 1950, though the Dutchman that discovered this initially
observed the connection during WW II. For a period of time it was thought
that one outgrew it, as visible symptoms disappeared in children after
being on a GF diet for a while. But later the intestinal biopsy was
developed, and they learned that even with no obvious symptoms there still
is damaged mucosa. Usually when the person reaches middle ages the visible
symptoms return, but often aren't connected with the childhood disease that
they overcame when an infant.<BR><BR>

&gt;I seem<BR>
&gt;to remember that Elaine also states that all gluten must be avoided...<BR><BR>

Oh, she does say this. But it is so hidden in modern foods that more then
her book is needed to learn all of the sources. For example (this is me
pulling out the book and checking....)<BR><BR>

- rice syrup often uses barley enzymes to break down the starch to a sugar
(though she would be presuming that all rice syrup is out).<BR>
- blue cheese traditionally used bread for the mild to grow on, and this is
one of the cheeses she allows.<BR>
- I see no mention of hydrolyzed proteins (HVP) which often comes from gluten.<BR>
- I see no warning against the ingredients &quot;flavorings&quot; or &quot;natural
flavors.&quot; These most often are euphemisms for HVP. This can appear in nuts,
usually ones that are dry roasted and/or sold in a glass jar, and many
other things which she disallows for other reasons.<BR>
- it is legal to not disclose ingredients of ingredients, so if tomato
paste is listed as an ingredient, then it often has HVP hidden in it.
- she allows tomato juice. This can have HVP hidden in it.<BR>
- while she warns of starches in vitamins, she fails to mention that gluten
is sometimes found in prescription drugs.<BR>
- she does not warn that spelt and kamut are really wheat (though spelt is
eliminated for being a grain, she makes no mention of kamut, nor does she
mention that faro is another name for spelt).<BR>
- she doesn't warn that candies can have wheat starch used on the conveyor
belts to prevent sticking and not be so labeled (though candies would be
out for their sugar).<BR>
- she permits white vinegar. This is controversial in the celiac community
as it can be distilled from wheat.<BR>
- she permits hard liquors made from wheat. This is controversial in the
celiac community.<BR>
- and more if I though about it longer.<BR><BR>

On the subject of &quot;cures&quot;. She also claims that the IBDs can be cured. Do
you know anybody that after being on the SCD for a while was able to go
back to a normal diet and eat bread and pasta with no repercussions? What I
see is it is successful in controlling the problem, but like in celiac
disease the diet must be maintained for life.<BR><BR>

Dear Don,<BR>
It is obvious that you've done your homework, however this problem you seem
to have with the word &quot;cure&quot; seems to me like quibbling over symantics. My
doctor tells me that quite contrarily to previous colonoscopies, these last
2 show my colon to look like that of a healthy 18 year olds, biopsies &amp;
all. I've been on the scd for over 2 years and am symptom free. Do I
consider myself cured? You bet your ass I do (pun intended). Would I test
this by eating as before? NO, I wouldn't. Something in my gut tells me that
anything beyond a minute amount of starch or sugar would bring me down. If
an alcohlic doesn't drink for 20 years, is he &quot;cured?. By some standards I
guess not, however I beleive that unless he takes another drink he is
cured. His symptons would probably return if he began drinking, as mine
might if I were to eat as before, but if he remained sober and if I stayed
on the diet, (seeing as my cup is always half full as opposed to half
empty), I'd consider us both blissfully CURED.<BR><BR>

Dr. Holland...<BR>
&gt;Too bad the IBD list isn't one of my lists. I'd just bounce him off. :)<BR>
&gt;(Maybe the listowner would like to move it to St. Johns?)<BR><BR>


Tsk tsk tsk. I'm glad you don't have the power Don. I'd hate to think that
you could shut disconnect me for not sharing your views. We've all got our

Well I believe that food is the cause of all IBDs. So I would want to work
with those 25% and find out what can be modified in the diet to allow them
to use diet for control. My suggestion would be to follow the guidelines in
&quot;Crohn's Disease: Maintenance of Remission By Diet,&quot; Alun, Jones, ... et
al,  Lancet. Volume V.II, 1985. Pages 177-180.<BR><BR>

In the study they started them on spring water and an elemental diet, then
added foods one by one to see what bugged them. It did not work for 16.7%.
So that would imply that there are 8% that can use a diet other than the
SCD to control their Crohn's. And since they tried the SCD we already know
they are motivated to try for a diet control.<BR><BR>

I am not sure where to look, but there are some figures for the<BR>

effective in about 40% of cases after 2 years.  I beleive that the<BR>

deteriorates over time.<BR>
<BR>
We had a member of our support group that found 6 mp to be effective for<BR>
about 2 years and then it was totally ineffective.<BR>

I think the SCD has the possiblity to be a long term solution.<BR>

<BR>
Dear fellow SCDers,<BR>
Lately, there has been a lot of talk about tweaking the diet. Here are a <BR>
a few of my thoughts on the subject of &quot;tweaking.&quot;  From day one,<BR>
we are all tweaking the diet. Am I ready for beans yet, what quantity? Am I<BR>
reacting to yogurt, or did I not make it right? Do I have a problem with<BR>
milk protein? Did coconut make me gassy because I'm reacting to it, or did<BR>
I just eat too much? Is my coffee too strong?  Am I overdoing it on fruit,<BR>
or desserts, or something else? Am I rounding out the diet enough? The list<BR>
could go on and on.  <BR>
Believe me, I know how discouraging it is to have a setback. I had a long<BR>
stretch of bloating during my second year, when I wasn't doing as well as I<BR>
had during my first. I thought many times that maybe the diet wasn't<BR>
working anymore, but I couldn't quit because I did appreciate having normal<BR>
bowe control again. Eventually the bloating past. My experience is that<BR>
with time the setbacks happen a lot less frequently, and don't last long.<BR>
We all progress at our own pace, so just because you're not recovering as<BR>
quickly as the next guy, doesn't necessarily mean that the diet isn't<BR>
working as well for you. I just hope that most of the tweaking being<BR>
discussed doesn't involve including foods that aren't allowed on the SCD. <BR>

<BR>
In talking with Elaine once she discussed that everybody with IBD while<BR>
having some symptoms the same are often very different, some bleed but but<BR>
have no anemia, others don't bleed but do have it.  Some, with IBD may<BR>
suffer wieght loss while others don't.  The onset and severity result in<BR>
differing effects.  Hence, the recovery through the SCD cannot, for the same<BR>
reasons be the same.  All will respond differently and depending on the<BR>
severity it is all down to being just a matter of time as to when a person<BR>
will recover.  For some this could be days, weeks, months or years.<BR>
However, we have believed that if you see some progress, regardless of size,<BR>
this is the impetus enough to keep going.  <BR>
<BR>
This diet cannot be &quot;cheated&quot; like other diets without some impunity.  While<BR>
some wieght reduction diets can tolerate &quot;cheating&quot; the SCD cannot.  This<BR>
diet works at a molecular level in the intestinal system to correct and<BR>
reverse the &quot;viscous cycle&quot; of damage/mucus/malabsorbtion/malnutrition.  One<BR>
mouthful of a non SCD food could set a person back months as the whole<BR>
intestinal balance is disruppted once again.  The best illustration I can<BR>
think of is the game of balancing a teeter/totter, it take a small step to<BR>
upset the balance.  The SCD provides this balance.<BR>
<BR>
Many tweak the diet to suit their needs, some cannot tolerate some foods<BR>
easily, it is a progressive approach to be taken on introducing the foods.<BR>
Our daughter still cannot handle uncooked fruit, but can now handle cooked<BR>
fruit.  We are all different.  Tweaking is just getting the rythm of your<BR>
body with the diet.  We have appreciated all the adjustments some have made,<BR>
some worked but others didn't.  What is important, as Lucy Rossett mentioned<BR>
is not to introduce foods that are not allowed - this is not tweaking the<BR>
diet it is simply choosing not to follw it.  We have found that this diet<BR>
will work given time. if it did not work then why has it been around so long<BR>
and has the testimony of thousands.  To all, follow what Elaine mentions   -<BR>
&quot;Fanatical adherence&quot; - this is the way to recovery.<BR>

Subject: <B>quitting the diet</B><BR>
<BR>


<P>Hello all,


<P>I'm sorry to report that I've felt I had to quit the diet, and did so last
November, 
after having been on it, no cheating, for 4 months.  When I began the  diet
in July, 
I improved, and I was able to reduce my prednisone from 20 mg to 15 mg.  Then I 
began to flare: my symptoms got worse (increased stool frequency, increased 
blood and mucus); I thought it was that initial one-month (or so) flare and
went 
back on the restricted version of the diet.  My symptoms continued to worsen, 
and I felt I had to increase my pred to 20 mg.  I saw no improvement by the end 
of November, in spite of following the diet to the letter, including a
couple of more 
times of the restricted version (which never really cleared things up like
it had 
initially).


<P>I spoke to Elaine.  She told me plainly that if the diet was working, I was 
supposed to see gradual and steady improvement, after the 1-month flare.  
Although she thought there was no harm in the diet, and wanted me to stay on it 
for general health principles, it seemed that she could not tell me the diet
was 
working.


<P>Others in the on-line IBD community have had a similar experience -- that after 
initially improving on the diet, they then got worse, and stayed worse in
spite of 
continuing on the diet.  (This contradicts the claims made about the diet --
that if it 
works initially, it should continue to work, possibly after an initial flare
at around 
one month).  I had to conclude that I too was in that boat.  If, after a
reasonable 
period, a proposed remedy fails to let me reduce my prednisone level, as far as 
I'm concerned the remedy isn't effective.  My goal is to get off prednisone and 
remain in remission, hopefully for a long time -- if a remedy isn't getting
me there, 
it's not working.  Bottom line.


<P>In addition, my cholesterol went from 183 to 233 during the time I was on
the diet.  
Without entering the debate about what really are protective factors for
coronary 
artery disease, I will just say that I regard high cholesterol, at least for
me, as a 
significant risk factor, and as highly desirable to change.


<P>For me the diet has been like many other things I've tried: it worked for a
little 
while but then it petered out.  That doesn't mean I think it's a bad thing.
I think it's 
basically good, and that low cholesterol versions could be worked out.  In
fact, I 
recommend it to my patients and acquaintances who have IBD (as it happens, I'm 
an acupuncturist, that's how I come to have &quot;patients&quot;).  I would never 
recommend that anyone for whom it was working should change their eating 
patterns in the slightest.  I'm in favor of studies of the SCD, and I
appreciate the 
difficulty of Elaine's position as a pariah in the world of allopathic, and
to a certain 
extent naturopathic, medicine.


<P>I think a real understanding of the diet would explain why it exhibited these 
different patterns (on some, it helps within 2-3 weeks and continues to
help, with 
some bumbs; on a second group, it helps at first and then stops; with a
third, it 
never seems to help at all), but I don't think proponents of the diet have
such an 
understanding.  I'm no biologist, but as an IBD sufferer I have tried to
read as 
intelligently and deeply as I could on the causes and various treatments for
IBD, 
and I have to conclude that, from my experience and from what I've read,
Elaine's 
theory -- as a theory -- just doesn't seem to hold water.  As a practical
aid, I put it 
in the same boat with other remedies I've tried, such as aloe vera (yes,
I've been 
through the aloe wars with Mannatech Inc), various naturopathic remedies, 
supplements and substitutes, and diets, and not to mention acupuncture and 
Chinese herbs:  they all have something to recommend them, and are worth 
trying as long as they do no harm, and sometimes they work.  I'll probably
try the 
diet again, if the meds I'm taking now don't work.


<P>At this time, though, I seem to be doing pretty well.  I've gone on 6-mp and
am up 
to my maximum dose (150 mg/day), and have been able to reduce my 
prednisone from 20 to 12.5 mg.  So far my blood work looks good, and I haven't 
developed pancreatitis.  I've been enjoying bread, pasta, and the occasional
beer, 
though I admit my carbs remain lower than previously -- I think there is
something 
to lower-carb ways of eating, at least for me.  So -- so far, so good.  But
I'm not 
out of the woods, as IBD-ers know.  It's not the first time I've been able
to reduce 
my pred -- last time I got down to 5 mg before flaring again -- and so if I'm 
optimistic it can only be cautiously.


<P>As far as this list goes, I've been on it since last May or so, I have some pet 
peeves which I'll leave to another posting, but on balance, I'm very glad
you're all 
out there contributing your energy to the list (though not very glad, of
course, that 
any of you are sick!).  I feel very fortunate to have been able to connect
with this 
part of the IBD on-line community (and with the rest of it as well).  So,
let me 
close now with a heartfelt Thank you!


<P>I'll probably lurk around on the list for awhile before getting around to 
unsubscribing, but if you want to contact me I'll probably respond quicker to a 
private e-mail than to a posting to the list.


<P>Again, thanks.

Subject: <B>Is SCD enough?</B><BR><BR>


<P>I have been on SCD about 4 months. I had good results on it for about 2
and 1/2 months and then seemed to hit a wall where I was not
progressing. In fact, I was relapsing!   In my frustration I went to a
holistic doc who diagnosed me with having a severe candida infection.  I
went on anti-fungal medications of both pharmaceautical and natural
varieties.  I was delighted that over the past 45 days I have done very
well.  During this time I have remained on the SCD diet.  After a short
period of &quot;die-off&quot; upon starting the meds, I experienced a fairly rapid
return to health. I credit both SCD and the meds for this.


<P>My question is this.  Elaine in her book clearly recognizes that
overgrowth of candida and other bacteria are one of the key elements of
the &quot;vicious cycle&quot;.  She clearly states that medications to control
inflammation and other symptoms is fine.  Why would a combination of SCD
and anti-fungal medications not be worth a try in dealing with this
vicious cycle.


<P>Even Elaine has said that SCD only works for about 80% of the people and
even then it takes 1-2 years of fanatical adherence to the diet.  Is it
possible that the other 20% would benefit from a combination?  Is it
possible that many who get better in 1-2 years could get better in
perhaps a few to several months instead?  


<P>I guess I don't understand why it is OK to take what many consider to be
very nasty drugs to control the symptoms of IBD, but it is not OK, or
even recommended to take relatively low toxic drugs (or at the very
least, natural antifungals like garlic, caprylic or undeclynic acids
etc)  to help the body to restore the balance of the gut flora?  There
is no question in my mind that the combination worked much better for me
than the diet alone.  Perhaps it would for others as well.  For your
consideration...

<P>hi


<P>glad you are feeling better !!!


<P>Pat,it sounds like your holistic doctor treated you the way Dr. Atkins describes
in his book &quot;Dr. Atkins Health Revolution&quot; published in 1990.  he seems
to treat IBD patients for either insufficient digestion due to insufficient
HCL due to possible insufficiency of one or more nutrients, or he  prescribes
something to kill candida. in all cases he puts you on either a low refined
carb diet or an all-out low carb diet (like Lutz) and then refers
you to his accupucturist for a series of treatments.  (i have  summarized
Atkins' treatment for IBD and am sure to have left out some details)


<P>does your holistic doctor use grapefruit seed extract in any of the
natural anti-fungals that he prescribed ?  this is supposed to be
an good anti-protozoa/virual/bacterial/fungal and is allegedly very
safe and will not kill your good bacteria.

<P>Pat, 


<P>We are finding the same to be true as far as taking natural remedies to help
the healing process.  I totally disagree with people that think it is okay to
take the synthetic drugs along with the diet, though.  The reason is that I
believe that those drugs actually cause the condition to worsen over time and
they affect the blood and the way that it is able to process proteins and
carbs.  A big cheer goes out to those that are finding ways to combat this
illness in natural ways, be it diet, enzymes, garlic or whatever.  We know
that the synthetics are harmful, so my husband stays away from them now. Thank
God that there are doctors out there that are going the natural way and not
killing us with drugs!

<P>Yes, there are strong similarities between Atkins and SCD.  I was
actually using Grapefruit seed extract along with SCD when I got stuck.
The doctor put me on a combination of Nizoril (200 mg per day) and 200
mg of Difulcan once every 4 days.  I also took Mycopryl from T.E Neesby
and SF722 from Thorne which is undeclynic (sp?) acid which is similar to
capryllic acid but more effective.  


<P>He also highly recommends both HCL and other digestive aids.

Subject: RE: Is SCD enough?<BR><BR>


<P>	Val,


<P>	Thank you for you response but I do have a question for you and
some additional thought to add to this discussion.


<P>	First, do you have any documentation to support your statement,
&quot;those drugs actually cause the condition to worsen over time and they
affect the blood and the way that it is able to process proteins and
carbs&quot;  I am not aware of any study done on this. I would love to have
anything you can provide to me that supports this.  


<P>	I am aware that the people selling the natural stuff make claims
that the &quot;synthetic&quot; drugs are bad but they don't offer anything to
support their &quot;potentially&quot; extremely biased statements.  Facts are that
I am aware of numerous people who have had very good experience dealing
with Candida with the  anti-fungal drugs.  I also happen to know
numerous people who have not been able to get rid of Candida by using
just the natural stuff.  I am also aware of some who have been able to
deal with it simply with natural stuff so it seems you have to use
whatever tool is needed to do the job!!  Everyone is biologically
unique!  One approach does not seem to work for all people!!


<P>	However, I have come to believe very strongly that there is
another possible sinister element at play in many, many cases of IBD,
IBS, Candida infections etc. that many people are simply not aware of as
yet, though the many scientific studies that are being done are
beginning to point at it.  I am speaking of mercury poisioning from
Silver/Mercury Amalgams.  I have done much reading on this topic over
the past few months and have found that it may well be the real cause of
much suffering that people go from doctor to doctor trying to solve.


<P>	I did a survey a few months back on this list where we
determined that 100% of the people responded positive to the question
&quot;Do you have Silver/Mercury Amalgams in your mouth or have you had
them?&quot;  Since only 60 to 70% of the population has them this is
statistically very interesting.  In a study done in Germany on 20,000
people with Amalgams there was a very high statistical correlation to GI
problems, periodontal and neurological problems.


<P>	In my case I have been searching not only to determine how to
get rid of candida, but why I got it in the first place.  A couple of
tests showed me having a very high amount of mercury in my body.
Mercury is a very strong immune suppresant.  One can kill candida all
day long and then it recurs because the body cannot keep it in check. I
am dealing with killing the candida as well as helping my body get rid
of the mercury that I have accumulated from my fillings and from eating
of mercury laden fish!  I suggest this because if it is indeed an
indirect causative agent for IBD etc. then until it is dealt with you
are really only dealing with symptoms and not the cause.  


<P>	NOTICE I said IF!!  I am simply suggesting that there is a
tremendous amount of data from extremely well done studies that is
pointing directly at Mercury poisoning as one major cause of IBD like
diseases.  Candida is simply an opportunistic organism taking advantage
of a suppressed immune system.  Interestingly, even Elaine in her book
when describing the vicious cycle says she does not know where or how
the cycle begins only that it does somehow begin.  Could it be mercury,
the most toxic metal known, somehow starts this process??  I don't know
for sure, but studying 20,000 people and finding a very high correlation
to GI problems is sure worth pursuing especially if 100% (at least the
ones who responded to the survey done here) of the people on this list
have mercury amalgams.  That is an astounding statistic.


<P>	I have info I can send to you via email but the doc is about 82k
and somepeoples email may not be able to handle it and I don't want to
burn the list server up sending it to everyone so if interested, ask and
I'll send it to your email direct.

<P>very interesting, and it's &quot;from&quot; the CDC web site, look
here also if you have any of the
various forms of arthritis. i think elains diet or the Lutz diet could
work simply by
avoiding carbohydrate rich meals (which will blunt your immune system
for about 2 hours)
we strengthen our immune system and thus fight off the bacteria, this
could also explain
the 2-4 month flare that accompanies the diet, your immune system is
stronger so the 
inflammation gets worse, until you get over the hump with the infection.
Lutz noted
this type response in his book and sometimes used gold to depress the
immune system
somewhat until things got better.<BR>

If I can offer a suggestion:<BR>
<BR>
The best research you're going to do in the scd is to try it.    If you<BR>
have IBD (IBS? what's the difference anyway?) you're definitely not going<BR>
to find a cure from research.  Research hasn't turned up anything that<BR>
works 100% of the time.<BR>
<BR>
Personally, I think the diet is helpful in reducing my symptoms.  But the<BR>
same can be said of the diet I'm doing right now, which is basically<BR>
bannanas, rice, applesauce and tea (B.R.A.T. its usually referred to, but<BR>
in the hospitial they'll say toast), but with added meat, eggs and cheese.<BR>
<BR>
1 1/2 years ago, I had absolute overnight results with the scd.   Now it<BR>
doesn't seem to do anything.  You'll never know to you try, and other than<BR>
the extra time involved in meal prep, it don't think it will do you any<BR>
harm.<BR>
<BR>
The biggest plus about the diet is that it is basically a very structured<BR>
elimination diet.  I've had so many health people say: &quot;Go on an<BR>
elimination diet&quot; and have very vague instructions.   The scd gives very<BR>
specific instructions and was quite easy to follow for me.  Now when<BR>
someone says, &quot;Don't eat anything the aggrevates your symptoms,&quot; I have a<BR>
much better understanding of what my problems foods are, and how to figure<BR>
out if a food is causing trouble.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Re: numerous recent posts suggesting link between low carb diet and<BR>
&gt;psychiatric symptom relief.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I also have personal experience with low carb diet and improvement in<BR>
&gt;depression/mental confusion/fatique symptoms.  For 15 years I controlled my<BR>
&gt;depression with a low carb diet ( less than 20 grams per day; no sugars of<BR>
&gt;any type and no grains).  I also suffered from insipient alcoholism and<BR>
&gt;&quot;sweet tooth&quot; binge eating as many of you have described on numerous<BR>
&gt;occassions.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;5 years ago I started taking zoloft/prozac with good results but needed to<BR>
&gt;do both low carb and SSRI medication to completely control both the<BR>
&gt;depression, fatique and binge eating/drinking.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Recently ( 3 months ) I started taking Nature's Biotics (probiotic) and<BR>
&gt;noticed complete removal of depression and fatique even after prolonged<BR>
&gt;abuse of carbohydrates ( all types including sugar and wheat).  I have now<BR>
&gt;cut the prozac from 20mg to 10mg per day with success.  I also recently ( 4<BR>
&gt;months ) started taking 2000 mg of metformin for very early type 2 diabetes<BR>
&gt;blood glucose levels.  I now seem to be able to eat 40-50 grams of carbs (<BR>
&gt;no sugar and no grains ) per day without fatique, without depression and<BR>
&gt;without elevated blood glucose levels.  I plan to cut the prozac completely<BR>
&gt;next month.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;My nineteen year old son suffered from panic anxiety for two years.  He is<BR>
&gt;now on a low carb diet ( 50 grams/ day ; no sugars, no wheat ) for 2 years<BR>
&gt;without any panic anxiety attacks.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I believe there is a strong connection between low carb diet and relief<BR>
&gt;from depression/anxiety.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I used to think the brain dysfunction connection was serotonin related.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;However I now think Elaine Gottschall's book &quot;Breaking the Viscious Cycle&quot;<BR>
&gt;may also describe a viable explanation.  The theory described in her book<BR>
&gt;suggests the brain dysfuctions stem from toxins produced in the intestines<BR>
&gt;when fungus/bacteria growth explodes with carbohydrate ingestion.   If I'm<BR>
&gt;able to completely cut my prozac with the addition of Nature's Biotics as<BR>
&gt;now seems to be possible, then I will vote for the &quot;bad bacteria&quot; low carb<BR>
&gt;theory rather than serotonin related theory.<BR>

dietary intake is our own innate wisdom. Some people have a problem with<BR>
that, I know, and to you, I offer my best wishes for your success as you<BR>
sort through the mire of nutritional information that floods the media.<BR>
<BR>
For those who resonate with my view, I would say that it is important<BR>
with Elaine's diet, to find a balance of various foods...not to rely too<BR>
heavily on red meats and nuts, without an adequate balance of fish,<BR>
poultry, vegetables and fruits.<BR>
<BR>
There is always going to be someone, somewhere, who is doing a study that<BR>
will prove or disprove, support or contradict a body of evidence. The key<BR>
is to trust that every day as we pay attention to our body's responses to<BR>
the foods we eat, that our body will signal us as to what works or<BR>
doesn't work for us as individuals. Otherwise, it is a sad mess, that<BR>
only leads to confusion and more confusion. Definitely, my son's<BR>
gastroenterologist would have cited many studies that tell me why<BR>
Elaine's diet wouldn't be able to help my son. So much for the strength<BR>
of those studies.<BR>
<BR>
In my experience, regarding my son, the SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE DIET<BR>
WORKS!!!!!!!! I will not now go searching for something else. What I see<BR>
is that my son's body is getting a welcome reprieve from a horrible<BR>
disease.... In time, and daily, we do and shall continue to adjust his<BR>
diet, to respond to his body's changing needs. But certainly, I will not<BR>
walk away from something that so effectively alleviates my son's<BR>
discomfort.<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to offer this message because I know how vulnerable we all<BR>
are...and how easily we tend to second guess ourselves, and make<BR>
ourselves and our choices wrong. Please, to those of you just getting<BR>
started, give this diet a chance to work, and your body a chance to heal.<BR>
<BR>
With great love,<BR>
<BR>

Two to three pounds of anything in our body will have a profound effect on<BR>

Beneficial bacteria are responsible for synthesizing vitamins and minerals.<BR>

I see no conflict between listening to our own bodies' innate wisdom,<BR>
while *also* sifting through the mountain of nutritional information. <BR>
How else do we discover new insights, understandings, and approaches<BR>
to our problems - with the ultimate goal of finding that which (our<BR>
innate wisdom tells us) really works?  After all, our innate wisdom<BR>
didn't automatically conjure up SCD out of the blue: someone either<BR>
told us about Elaine's book or we found it by digging it out from the<BR>
muck and mire.  Our innate wisdom can't tell us whether or not a<BR>
particular diet is right for us before we find out about it.  I<BR>
imagine there are *many* IBD sufferers who have plenty of innate<BR>
wisdom, but who have not (yet) had the good fortune of learning that<BR>
SCD even exists... not to mention those who *did* follow it, without<BR>
success, and whose innate wisdom told them it wasn't right, so they<BR>
must resume their quest for some other means of dietary success. <BR>
(Heck, Elaine herself wrote that not everyone will be helped by SCD!)<BR>

I'm sincerely thrilled for your son (and for you) that SCD works for<BR>

<BR>
I posted the article merely because it shows how other researchers,<BR>
besides Elaine, are aware of and actively pursuing an intestinal<BR>
bacteria/IBD connection.  I happen to think it's interesting that, on<BR>
the one hand, their work validates what Elaine has been saying, while<BR>
on the other, their tentative dietary conclusions are nearly the<BR>
opposite of hers.  I never intended to challenge anyone's success with<BR>
SCD.  Besides, as the article says, those Cambridge chaps are merely<BR>
chasing down a theory - they haven't even begun to outline a diet, let<BR>
alone test it on anyone.  SCD, on the other hand, has already been<BR>
successfully implemented by thousands of people over many years.<BR>

I'd like to close with an administrative-type request to everyone on<BR>

<BR>
I know that many people sort posts by &quot;subject&quot; - this is a very<BR>
useful means of keeping all the wonderful information that we share on<BR>
this list organized and easy to reference when necessary.  Changing<BR>
the &quot;subject&quot; header in a post that is a reply to another post in the<BR>
same thread makes it far more difficult for people to keep track of<BR>
that thread.  That's why I added &quot;(was: A Gut Feeling)&quot; to the<BR>
&quot;subject&quot; header of this post, to indicate that &quot;conflicting guidance&quot;<BR>
is part of the same thread as &quot;A Gut Feeling.&quot;  In the future, can we<BR>
please try to keep our headers consistent, only changing them when the<BR>
content of the messages changes to the extent that they no longer<BR>
match the header (and using &quot;was:&quot; when such a change is necessary)? <BR>

To: SCD-list@longisland.com<BR>
Subject: Re: How come CCFA doesn't discuss the &quot;SCD&quot; diet at all?<BR>
<BR>
The basic reason (from what I have been told) is that the medical profession<BR>
has a strict set of guidelines for medical research for particular therapies<BR>
- drugs or otherwise.  The basis of their study ( so that a false sense of<BR>
wellbeing is eliminated from study results) is the now famous standard of<BR>
medical research - The Blind Study.  The blind study is just as its name<BR>
implies - you do not know you are taking something, so the researchers get<BR>
the unbiased viewpoint (your feeling of well being is not a factor because<BR>
you are lead to believe that the placebo could be the real thing).  Now<BR>
comes the tough one for the medical profession - how do you conduct a blind<BR>
study on the SCD - how do you give someone placebo chicken, placebo cheese,<BR>
placebo honey or even placebo almond flour, let us not forget placebo<BR>
carrots. Simply put, they cannot do it.  So diet cannot be &quot;properly&quot;<BR>
studied under the prevalent medical research dictum.  if they cannot have a<BR>
blind study then there is no basis for the therapuetic claims, hence no<BR>
statements by the CCFA or the Canadian equivalent as to supporting diet as<BR>
an effective means of conrolling symptoms and eventually putting you into<BR>
remission.  If the FDA and TTP (Canadian) have not endorsed a study and<BR>
subsequent clinical trials then no claims can be made by the profession and<BR>
a particular group (CCFA).  Also, do you think that the major funding of<BR>
drug research (pharmceutical companies) would wholeheartedly support such a<BR>
research program?  Could we imagine them rushing to give research centres<BR>
millions of research dollars for diet research so that people find out that<BR>
it is the local farmers market that can supply them with the elements that<BR>
lead to a solution for their ills and not the local drug store?  Give the<BR>
choice - diet or long term drug therapies which do you think Eli-Lilly or<BR>
Galxo is going to support?  Next time the CCFA comes looking for your $, ask<BR>
them for a list of their funding support, after the average Joe<BR>
On-The-Street guess who is behind them.<BR>
<BR>
But the reality is that for decades a blind study has been going on.  I am<BR>
sure that if this diet did not work, there would be no BTVC and there would<BR>
not be a support group like this.  I find it difficult to believe that<BR>
thousands worldwide over many years have put &quot;blind&quot; faith into this diet<BR>
just for the sake of it - if it did not work, they would have given it up<BR>
long ago and the majority would speak to that fact. The opposite has<BR>
occured, many are telling their friends about it who suffer with these<BR>
debilitating and humilating illnesses.  <BR>
<BR>
My wife and I have watched our daughter go through the worste of times,<BR>
stuff we do not even want to talk about.   We have lived through her and<BR>
watched, helplessly as the effects of IBD took our daughters life and will<BR>
away.  We remember the early days of the diet and wondering like many of you<BR>
- will it work?.  But a few told us to stick with it and told us that &quot;this<BR>
too will pass&quot;.  For the last 44 months she has been &quot;fanatical&quot; no cheats,<BR>
deviations or otherwise and the proof of the success is that for the first<BR>
time in many years, this weekend she went camping with her friends, hiked a<BR>
trail that tests the endurance of the strong and called and told us how much<BR>
fun she was having.  Yes she is up their with her LL Bread, Muffins, Carrot<BR>
Cake and honey.  Hers and your testement are the evidence - we do not need<BR>
any endorsement by anybody except those who have with the SCD took their<BR>
lives back.<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
Partridge Family<BR>
<BR>
 It is also unfair that many like the CCFA label this diet as part of the<BR>
&quot;quackery&quot; that is going on (as seen by the &quot;open arms&quot; enthusiasm with<BR>
which the majority of GI specialists and MD's embrace the SCD)  You are all<BR>
evidence that this works, and so we do not need any research, endorsement by<BR>
the CCFA, or a &quot;blind study&quot; the proof is in the growing numbers who have<BR>
found relief with this diet.  <BR>

<BR>
The recent letter from the partridge family, regarding why the CCFA or the<BR>
CCFC cannot/ will not recognize the SCD states, in my opinion, the problems<BR>
of conducting such Blind Tests correctly.<BR>
If I may be so bold as to add one point to such a fine letter from the<BR>
Partridges, it would be as follows.<BR>
If the SCD was marketable and shares could be sold on the stock markets<BR>
around the world, as are Drugs to-day, there is no doubt in my mind, such<BR>
research of the SCD would take place.<BR>
We on this list bought into a concept for the price of a book. We didnot pay<BR>
for 100s of millions of dollars of research costs when we bought the book.<BR>
It is very difficult for anyone of us when we are extremely sick, to believe<BR>
the drugs we require to become healthy, are conduits for making others rich.<BR>
A sad tale, but true.<BR><BR>
 ALLAN<BR>
I hold your letter in the highest reguard, and thank you for taking the time<BR>
to post it. I am 64 months at present on the SCD. Even to-day in full<BR>
remission I remain on the diet, at least 98% of the time. The amazing thing<BR>
to me is when I look back at the beginning of the diet, and complained of<BR>
why must I be the one to do without starch and refined sugar? How terrible<BR>
this world was treating me, I believed. (I call it The Poor Me Syndrome)<BR>
To-day I shake my head in wonderment, hardly believing my good fortune in<BR>
finding a cure for my illness... and at a pittance, the  price of a mere<BR>
book.<BR>
<BR>
I no longer feel I am being denied good food, for now I realize I am eating<BR>
a much healthier diet than I ever had prior to being on the SCD.<BR>
I dont understand why there are so many stars in the sky, and I dont care. I<BR>
dont understand why this diet works for me, and I dont care. But I tell<BR>
anyone that will listen, I found a fortune when I found the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
My wish is that all who find this diet and stick with it will enjoy the<BR>
results as I do.<BR>

Good Health to All<BR>

Dear Oprah,<BR>
What if someone were to discover the cure for cancer or AIDS? How would he<BR>
muscle his way through the snake oil salesmen, to a forum upon which he<BR>
would be heard? How would he pierce the armor of calloused skepticism we<BR>
all wear to shield us from years of exposure to those who sell us lies and<BR>
fabrications?<BR>
Oprah, I was handed the gift of a cure to my own disease which is<BR>
ulcerative colitis. This disease is not openly discussed because it has to<BR>
do with bodily functions and oftentimes experts mistakenly place blame on<BR>
the victim, claiming it  is something he or she could control, if  they<BR>
chose.  I timidly tiptoed around that gift, afraid to open it, certain it<BR>
was a hoax, when in fact it was and is the real thing. I have been in total<BR>
remission from this disease for two and a half years, all documented by<BR>
hospital tests. My miracle came in the form of a book called &quot;Breaking the<BR>
vicious cycle&quot; written by Elaine Gottschall. I know that some day she will<BR>
hold a place in history and in heaven with the likes of Madame Curie and<BR>
Mother Theresa.  Thousands of people have walked exactly the same road as I<BR>
have,  to find this cure, complete with its detours of reluctance and<BR>
skepticism and they too have documentation of their trip.<BR>
I know that I can't ask you to accept and televise what I have written in<BR>
blind faith. I write you today to beg you to investigate my allegations.<BR>
Have someone just look at the book and at the pages and pages of testimony<BR>
attesting to the truth of what I say. You often express how you feel about<BR>
making this a better world and you have the power to encourage awareness<BR>
about a nightmare that plagues millions of people and to bring the whole<BR>
issue out of the shadows. I'm trying to keep this letter brief, but it is<BR>
surely a complicated issue. So I will just end this letter giving you my<BR>
phone numbers and those of Ms. Gottschall and pray fervently that I have<BR>
been able to spark the tiniest bit of interest from you.<BR>

Subject: breast feeding<BR>
<BR>
On the Dr. Ronald Hoffman site (where I found out about the SCD) he<BR>
mentions a few avenues being explored about the explosion of IBD in the<BR>
last fifty years.  The introduction of antibiotics, in humans and feed<BR>
animals, approximately fifty years ago is a very strong suspect as well<BR>
as the live measles vaccine when we were young.  There has also been<BR>
studies of floridation, cholorination of our water source as well as<BR>
something as simple as the use of toothpaste and minute particles of<BR>
dental fillings found in the gut.  Lack of breast feeding as well as the<BR>
early introduction of cow, soy milk and fruit juices to infants is also<BR>
a culprit.  I don't think it is any one thing personally, but an<BR>
onslaught of modern medicine and food eating practices that have<BR>
contributed to IBD.  The SCD diet is much closer to the &quot;caveman diet&quot;<BR>
than anything else.  The caveman ate no grains, only meat, seeds, nuts,<BR>
fruits, greens, tubers, insects, etc.  Nothing was cultvated.<BR>
Intellectually we have changed considerably, but possibly our guts<BR>
haven't.  I find this very interesting.  My husband who has UC grew up<BR>
in India.  Processed food was unheard of.  His mother followed<BR>
homeopathic practices.  He developed UC 4 to 5 years ago after over 20<BR>
years of living here and eating American style.  Holly<BR>

&gt; The reason that this quote bothers me is that it kind of gives the idea that<BR>
&gt; a cure could happen if only the person following the SCD is faithful and<BR>
&gt; fanatic enough.  Personally, I don't think that everybody can be cured by<BR>

&gt; I love this diet and things that it's doing for me.  Yet, I do not want to<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; I agree, however, with this statement.  If you are going to see quick<BR>
&gt; improvements, you have to be careful and take in the purist of foods.  You<BR>
&gt; are not going to get anywhere if you compromise your committment to the<BR>
&gt; diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Yet, I don't like to follow things blindly.  I need to make my own<BR>
&gt; investigations about things.  That's one reason that I'm looking up<BR>
&gt; information on the kwark.  Granted it probably isn't safe, as many have told<BR>
&gt; me, but I'm not going to reject a food without first checking out the facts.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Anyway (I didn't mean to ramble), thanks for reminding that it's totally up<BR>

Your bringing up a rather interesting topic for me, are we &quot;curing&quot; our gut<BR>
disease?<BR>
I don't believe the SCD is a cure,  I think it creates remission from our<BR>
disease.<BR>
It might not work for everyone but neither does drugs, and eating healthy foods<BR>
is deeply satisfying and a powerful way to help myself. It will never harm me.<BR>
<BR>
In the past 6 weeks SCD has taken away many of my symptoms of the disease. I<BR>
think it's  Dan who is a long term user of SCD. He was in remission than he<BR>
returned to an unrestricted way of eating food with refined carbohydrates he<BR>
eventually got a flare up of the disease again.<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, My point is SCD appears to keep the disease under control..<BR>
Unfortunately in our popular culture It takes an enormous amount of our effort<BR>
to just eat fresh unprocessed nutritious food as close to the source it comes<BR>
from.<BR>

LIFE ON THE SCD<BR>
Many list members are concerned that they may have to spend the rest of 
their lives on the SCD.<BR>
But why is it more difficult to stick to the SCD than to the typical 
Western Diet?<BR>
Chiefly because the foods of the WD are more readily available, more widely 
available, more attractively packaged, more expensively marketed and cheaper.<BR>
Why?<BR>
Because manufacturers perceive a greater demand for WD foods than for SCD 
foods.<BR>
And this, in turn, is because consumers demand WD foods.<BR>
HOWEVER - if consumers began to discover how delicious, how nutritious and<BR>
above all how HEALTH-GIVING the SCD is, the tide might well turn. <BR>
OK, there are 187 of us on this list - but how many people, young and old,<BR>
are out there in the world, suffering from Crohn's, colitis, cystic<BR>
fibrosis, diverticulitis, celiac disease, chronic diarrhoea and<BR>
constipation - people who would benefit from the SCD if only they knew<BR>
about it?  Judging by the number and variety of laxatives and<BR>
anti-diarrhoea medications on the supermarket shelves and in the<BR>
pharmacies, our membership of 187 is merely the tip of a vast iceberg.<BR>
Don't you wish you had heard about the SCD when your first bowel symptom<BR>
appeared?<BR>
If the community at large could be made aware of the benefits of following<BR>
the SCD, eventually manufacturers would have to sit up and take notice, and<BR>
start producing SCD compatible foods. This would make life easier for all<BR>
of us.  I would love to be able to buy<BR>
* lactose-free 24-hour fermented yoghurt,<BR>
* nut-flour cakes sweetened with fruit &amp; honey<BR>
* nut-flour breads<BR>
* travelling foods<BR>
* sugar-free bacon and biltong (cannot find it in Australia)<BR>
* frozen SCD-compatible meals for when you don't have time to cook<BR>
<BR>
I am sure everyone would be able to add many other foods to this list.  I<BR>
would also like to see restaurants and airlines offering SCD meals.  <BR>
How can we publicise the SCD? - Especially when the established medical<BR>
profession is so adamantly, (one might almost say violently), opposed to<BR>
non-drug non-surgical treatments of bowel disease.<BR>
Probably you have all talked about the diet amongst your friends and<BR>
relatives.  This is a good way of spreading the word.  Another way is to<BR>
buy an extra copy of BTVC and donate it to your local library.  If you do<BR>
this, you might call up your local newspaper and let them know why you are<BR>
donating the book - you never know, they might see a story in it.  Almost<BR>
everyone is interested in good health.<BR>
If you can think of any other ways, please post them - I am interested.  I<BR>
hope I have explained my thoughts on the value of doing this.<BR>
Let's try and replace wheat fields with almond orchards, acres of<BR>
sugar-cane with acres of bee-hives. Publicise the SCD and let us all benefit.<BR>

Maybe what the SCD needs is a movie like &quot;Lorenzo's Oil,&quot; or that<BR>
made-for-TV movie (I forgot the name) about the Ketogenic Diet for<BR>
epilepsy (at least the latter has Johns Hopkins, et al, backing it<BR>
up).  Hello... Hollywood, are you listening?<BR>
