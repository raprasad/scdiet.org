<B>DCCC - Make it Yourself! </B><BR>
Mon, 17 Mar 1997 17:14:12 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Dear SCDers:<BR>
I did some net research and finally found out how to make Dry Curd Cottage
Cheese yourself, for those people who can't find it in the stores and are
still obsessed with trying it. Maybe you'll want to give it a whirl. It
seems pretty time consuming to me, but at least you have the option.<BR>
<BR>
I also found a website that tells quite a bit about cheese making. Check
it out if you're interested in it:<BR>
Go to:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cheesemaking.com/">http://www.cheesemaking.com/</A><BR>
The section called &quot;cheesemaking 101&quot; is pretty good:<BR>

The following recipe was sent to me by a housewife who has dairy cows. 
YES, I believe it is DRY CURD, as all cottage cheese actually is until they
start adding cream and other stuff to it. Just *omit the part about adding
the cream at the end*, obviously.<BR>
<BR>
-------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Anna, The recipe that I use for cottage cheese comes from a cookbook called
THE COMPLETE DAIRY FOODS COOKBOOK. It's out of print but if you can find
a copy of it (your local library may have a copy), it is an excellent source
and fun to read. We raise both dairy cows and goats for our own use but
I have only use cow's milk in this recipe. Hope you enjoy it and if I can
help any more, please let me know. <BR>
This recipe is fairly easy but takes time. Don't let the low-fat part fool
you, the tasteis much richer than what you buy in the store.<BR>
Thanks for writing.<BR>

<B>LOW-FAT COTTAGE CHEESE</B><BR>
<BR>
1 gallon raw skim goat's or cow's milk <BR>
4 ounces Cheese Starter<BR>
<BR>
1. Pour the milk into a stainless steel kettle and set the kettle in a
hot water bath. <BR>
 Put the dairy thermometer in the milk. Heat until the milk reaches 160*F
and hold 3 seconds. At once remove the milk kettle from the hot water and
cool it rapidly in cold water to 72*F.<BR>
<BR>
2. Add the cheese starter; stirring it in thoroughly. Cover the kettle
and let it stand overnight at room temperature (in the low 70s). In 12
to 16 hours the milk should have set into a soft-firm custard-like curd.
 If you press the side of<BR>
the curd with a knife, a section should break away from the side of the
kettle in a soft but clearly defined line if enough acid has developed to
precipitate the milk solid. If the milk has not set, allow it to stand
several hours longer. It may take 12 to 48 hours for the curd to set, longer
if the starter was weak or the room is cold.<BR>
<BR>
3. Using a long stainless steel knife, cut the curd in 3 directions, producing
1/4 to 1/2 inch cubes. Cut lengthwise, then crosswise, then using the knife
at a slant, cut diagonal. As you cut you will notice the clear, pale yellow
whey welling up as it is released from the curd by the cutting action of
the knife. When all the curd is cut, allow it to rest in the kettle 10
minutes.<BR>
<BR>
4. Put the curd kettle back in the hot water kettle. Put the dairy thermometer
in the <BR>
curd, then heat SLOWLY 30 to 40 minutes. Bring the temperature up to 102*F
if you are <BR>
using cow's milk and to 106*F if using goat's milk. The rate of temperature
increase <BR>
should be about 1* per minute. During the hearing, stir the curd by lifting
it up <BR>
gently from the bottom of the kettle with a slotted stainless steel spoon.
 Do not mash <BR>
or crush the curd. <BR>
<BR>
5. Now raise the heat slightly and stir-lift more frequently as the curds
tighten up and become tougher. When the temperature reaches 115*F, reduce
the heat and keep stirring until the curds feel firm and slightly rubbery
to a gentle pinch.<BR>
<BR>
6. Remove the kettle from the heat and dip out as much whey as you can
without rupturing the curds. <BR>
<BR>
7. Line a colander with a double layer of damp cheesecloth. Set it in
a bowl to catch the whey. Pour in the remaining curds and whey and let
them drain several minutes.<BR>
<BR>
8. Gather up the ends of the cheesecloth into a bag and rinse the bag of
curds 2 to 3 minutes in cool water, gently palpating the curds for a thorough
rinse. <BR>
Discard the water. Rinse several more times in fresh cold water to which
a tray of ice cubes has been added.<BR>
<BR>
9. Return the bag to the colander and allow it to drain an hour or longer.<BR>
<BR>
The cottage cheese is now ready to eat. It is a low-fat, nutritious, high-protein
food. You can vary the flavor and texture by stirring in several tablespoons
of cream, or adding chopped chives, garlic, parsley, sage, tarragon or
ground pepper.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here are some of my own suggestions and/or preferences. I use an enamel
canner or roaster pan and heat directly on the burner instead of a water
bath. You have to heat it slow and watch for scorching. I use who cow's
milk at room temperature. <BR>
When heating the curds, you can make them as soft or as firm as you like.
 You will develop a preference as you try it several times. We like a larger,
firmer curd with salt and some cream added in. Add the salt after you have
finished rinsing, right before step <BR>
<BR>
9. If you add the cream right before you serve it, the drier curds will
keep longer in the refrigerator. Ours never lasts long anyway. :) <BR>

This is an alternative, Danish version, which we received from Lotte Wackerhagen 
and Kirsten Iversen:<BR>
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="HomemadeDryCurdCottageCheese"></A>
<B>Homemade Dry Curd Cottage Cheese - app. 3 litres</B><BR>
<BR>
Ingredients:<BR>
<LI> 8 litres of pasteurized milk<BR>
<LI> Culture &quot;starter&quot;, 100 ml, (for instance: buttermilk or yoghurt naturel)<BR>
<LI> 3 ml rennet (the bacterial culture), mixed with 10 ml cold water<BR>
<LI> Half a teaspoon fine salt<BR>
<BR>
Plus: <BR>
<LI> a thermometer for temperature controls when heating the milk<BR>
<BR>
Clean the 10 litre saucepan/pot with steelwool or other suitable material for cleaning. 
It is the tiny remnants that make the milk scorching and sticking.<BR>
<BR>
1. Pour milk in a saucepan with a thick bottom and heat while stirring to about 32 cup (Celcius).<BR>
<BR>
2. While still stirring, &quot;starter&quot; is poured into the milk. Milk must now be 
left quiet for 1 hour under cover, in order to ripe. Cover with a towel to keep temperature.<BR>
<BR>
3. Then add rennet and half a teaspoon fine salt into the milk, during a short stirring. 
Leave the milk for &quot;renning&quot; for about 1 hour, covered. <BR>
After one hour, the coagulate should be ready to cut.<BR>
<BR>
4. When milk has coagulated, it is cut into dices, and the whey and the dry curd is parted. 
You have to cut coagulate with a long knife in homogene dices (about 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm).<BR>
Suggestion on how to cut the cheese:<BR>
&nbsp; 1. Cut vertical, first in direction &quot;east-west&quot;, then in direction &quot;north-south&quot;<BR>
&nbsp; 2. Then cut on a 45 degree angle, again first in direction &quot;east-west&quot;, then 
 in direction &quot;north-south&quot;.<BR>
Leave the contents of the pot for about 15 minutes under cover.<BR>
<BR>
5. Dry Curd is now heated to 45-55 celcius. Heating MUST be very slowly with very low heat, 
since the rise in temperature to 44-55 celsius should durate 1 hour.<BR>
If done faster, the dry curd will end up like rubber, and not delicious.<BR>
Stir cautiously now and then during heating.<BR>
<BR>
6. The contents of the pot is gradually poured in a colander to drain the whey.<BR>
<BR>
7. Right after, the cheese grains are rinsed out in abundantly cold water in the colander. 
Take care that the grains do not stick together. Separate big grain with the fingers. Shake off the water.<BR>
<BR>
8. Pour the dry curd in suitable containers. To be kept cool or in freezer.<BR>
<BR>

<B>COTTAGE CHEESE </B></B><BR>
<BR>
1 5.00 L skim milk <BR>
2 125.00 mL cultured buttermilk<BR>
3 3.00 mL salt <BR>
4 250.00 mL table cream (optional)<BR>
<BR>
After skim milk and buttermilk come to room temperature (21 C), combine
in a stainless steel container. Let stand at 21 cup until set (20 to 24 h).
The curd is ready to cut when a soft gel forms and a small amount of liquid
(whey) appears on the surface. Using a long knife, cut curd one direction
into 1 cm strips and then cut the other direction to make 1 cm cubes, holding
the knife at an angle. Let stand 10 min. Set the container of curds on a
rack in a large pan of water. <BR>
Slowly heat to 60 cup in l h, stirring every 5 min. Hold at 60 cup for l h stirring
frequently. At this point the curds will be firm. Line strainer with four
layers of cheesecloth then pour boiling water through cheesecloth. Drain
cheese through strainer. Rinse curd with cold running water to reduce acidity
(about 10 min). Let drain until all whey is out (about 15 min). Add salt;
combine with table cream. Makes 1.5 L. <BR>

<B>Making Sour Cream</B><BR>
<BR>
To make sour cream, take one cup of fresh cream (or, if you don't have a
milk cow, buy heavy whipping cream from the store). Mix it with one tablespoon
of sour-cream (this is where the culture comes from). <BR>
<BR>
You need to keep this mixture, in whatever container you mixed it in, at
about 70 degrees for 24 hours. If the top of your fridge is warm you could
set it there.... I just fill up a bowl with hot water and put the container
in there (usually have to weight it down or it will float). After 24 hours
it will<BR>
have thickened considerably. (If not, the temperature was too low... just
get it to 70 degrees and let it<BR>
sit until it thickens). Then put it in the fridge. It is best to refridgerate
it for 24 hours before using it. <BR>
<BR>
Once you have your sour cream, you can use a tablespoon of it to get your
next batch going... <BR>
<BR>
This is a great sour cream... we like it much better than what we buy at
the store. Try it! <BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Dear SCDers:<BR>
I just recently noticed that Elaine says in the book that if we can find
a<BR>
brand of commercial sour cream that is very low in lactose, we can use it!
 I<BR>
love sour cream, as I was brought up on Hungarian cooking which uses a lot
of<BR>
sour cream in it. You can add it to meat dishes, vegetable dishes, etc.
 You<BR>
can also do these recipes with yogurt but it has more of a sour taste. 
If you<BR>
make yogurt with whipping cream, I find it tastes more like sour cream.
 I am<BR>
going to try to make homemade sour cream. It's hard to find info about
how to<BR>
make it on the net, but I came across a couple of recipes. It seems that
the<BR>
key is that you need a different bacterial culture for a starter (which
you get<BR>
from either commercial buttermilk or sour cream), and it must be incubated
at a<BR>
lower temperature than yogurt. Therefore, I can't use my yogurt maker.
 I am<BR>
going to try doing it in the oven with a 40 watt light bulb. I'll let you
know<BR>
how it turns out.<BR>
<BR>
Have any of you out there tried store bought sour cream or made it yourself?<BR>
I would love to hear from anyone who is interested in the concept of these<BR>
homemade cultured dairy products, as I am. Especially if you have actually<BR>
made something other than yogurt.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to confirm with Elaine that making our own cottage cheese and
sour<BR>
cream is allowable also, so if any of you call her in the near future, please<BR>
add this question to your list and let us know.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
Anna<BR>

<B>How to make allowable SOUR CREAM</B><BR>
 Fri, 25 Apr 1997 17:30:18 GMT<BR><BR>

To all who want to try making SOUR CREAM:<BR>
Store bought buttermilk can be used as a STARTER to make homemade SOUR CREAM. 
You do it the same way as you make yogurt, using half and half or whipping
cream. You must ensure the cream has no bad additives in it though. In my
area I can not find any brand of whipping cream that does not have carageenen
or other crap added. (Not only is it bad in general to have additives for
yogurt/sour cream making purposes, but I have read several articles that said
carageenen has been used as an agent to CAUSE Crohn's in lab rats! ) Anyway,
you can make sour cream the same way as yogurt, but it needs to be fermented at
a lower temperature. Therefore, the yogurt makers most of us have are set at
too high a temperature for sour cream. The way I figured out how to do it is
to make a batch of
yogurt and then put the batch of sour cream ON TOP of the yogurt containers,
and wrap the whole machine with a thick bath towel. I have a Salton yogurt
maker with those 7 little glass cups. I simply don't put the big plastic cover
on top of the machine, and put the sour cream batch directly on top of the
little jars (in a bowl or other glass/ceramic container). Covering it all with
a towel acts like a "tea cozy", retaining the heat. This way the sour cream
can ferment at the lower temperature required.
<P>
The only difference between yogurt and sour cream is the 1) fat content
(usually
sour cream is made with full fat heavy cream, and yogurt is lighter); and 2)
the
SPECIES of bacteria used as a "culture" are different. You can buy powdered
starter for sour cream (hard to find), or use buttermilk or commercial sour
cream. I found it
impossible to find a store bought brand of sour cream that has no bad additives
though, so I use buttermilk in which ingredients are: milk, bacterial culture,
salt. I have been using half and half cream because the ingredients are: milk,
cream. I use it to make all my yogurt and my sour cream. The sour cream would
taste better if I used whipping cream (heavy cream), but I simply can't get it
anywhere around this major metropolitan city unfortunately! The sour cream
comes out milder in flavor than a commercial sour cream tastes, but it is still
very good and tasty, and different from yogurt.
<P>
I don't think many people are aware that we are allowed to have sour cream on
the SCD "if we can find one with minimal lactose", as it says in the book. 
Since this product did not exist in my area, I researched on the net how to
make it. That's when I found out how to make DCCC also, but I'm not that
ambitious, since I can buy a perfectly good DCCC here at the stores. 
Personally, I LOVE sour cream, and being raised on a lot of Hungarian cuisine
which has a lot of sour cream in many of the dishes, I can find lots of uses
for it.
<P>
Try it, it really can add tremendous variety to your meals and it's something
different! I invented this procedure using a Salton Yogurt Maker with 7 little
jars. I'm sure if you have another type of Yogurt Maker you could ad lib a way
to do it. The point of the matter is getting a consistent temperature which is
lower than the temperature the yogurt ferments at. By placing the sour cream
batch on top of the yogurt, the temperature is automatically lower because of
the distance from the heat source, yet it remains consistent over the 24 hours.
 You MUST make yogurt at the same time as you make the sour cream.
<P>
1. Heat 1 1/2 or 2 litres or quarts of cream (with no additives) to boiling
point. (The amount of cream you use depends on how much sour cream you want to
make, which also depends on how big your bowl or container is. The container
must be able to sit ON TOP of the jars of yogurt that fit into your yogurt
maker.) <P>
2. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature<P>
3. One litre/quart of the cream will be used to make yogurt and the rest will
be used for sour cream.<P>
4. Proceed with making the yogurt as usual, using 1/2 of the cooled cream. Add
the starter, fill the yogurt jars, put the lids on, & place in the machine.<P>
5. To the remaining bowl of cream add 1/8th cup commercial buttermilk (ensuring
the ingredients are only milk, bacterial culture, salt)<P>
6. Stir well and pour this mixture into a suitable container for fermenting. 
It should be a glass bowl or jar, ceramic dish, or pyrex casserole (not metal
or plastic).<P>
7. Place the container ON TOP of the little glass jars in the yogurt maker.<P>
8. Cover the whole machine with a THICK bath towel, bunching it up around the
machine to retain the heat.<P>
9. DO NOT tuck the towel underneath the machine, as this could be a fire
hazard.<P>
10. Wait 24 hours, then remove all the sour cream and yogurt and refrigerate
the containers until well chilled before using.<P>
11. ENJOY!<P>

Just a word of caution. For a year I've been buying a dry curd cottage<BR>
cheese (labeled as such) thinking it was OK. Now I realize that the<BR>
ingredients state: &quot;cultured skim milk, milk&quot; I thought it was dry<BR>
curd, but in reality milk has been added back into the product and it is<BR>
not OK.<BR>

<B>SOUR CREAM - Homemade (II)</B><BR><BR>
Melissa and others,<BR>
I make my own sour cream, using powdered starter from the health food store
&amp; half and half cream. It's the same as making yogurt, but you use either
the powdered &quot;sour cream/buttermilk starter&quot; OR regular commercial
buttermilk from the supermarket with no additives. The difference is, you
don't need to use the yogurt maker because the temperature required for
fermentation is room temperature! It's actually easier to make than yogurt
because of this. 
<P>As an aside, a couple years ago or so, I posted a lot of instructions on
making sour cream (which I believe are still on Mik's SCD site), but
unfortunately, they are out of date and wrong, because, since then, I
figured out an easier and better way to make it, as noted above.
<P>I will list the exact instructions for those interested:<BR>
<P>-bring to the boil one litre/quart half and half cream.
 <BR>-allow it to cool to room temperature.
 <BR>-strain out any skin that has formed on the top.
 <BR>-remove about a cup or so of the cooled cream, and add to it 1/4 cup of
commercial additive free buttermilk, OR freeze dried powdered sour
cream/buttermilk/fresh cheese starter (this is what it should say on the
envelope).
 <BR>-stir for at least 2 minutes until completely disolved.
 <BR>-pour the cup of cream mixture back into the container of the rest of cooled
cream.
 <BR>-stir well to combine.
 <BR>-pour into 2 or more containers (such as glass jars, or plastic sour cream
or yogurt containers)
 <BR>-cover tightly and place in an undisturbed spot in the kitchen, such as the
back corner of the counter top.
 <BR>-leave it to incubate for 24-30 hours. It should be done in 24 hrs, but it
won't hurt to leave it up to 30, but then it should be refrigerated to
prevent mold, and spoilage.
 <BR>-If you disturb the container, sometimes it seems to ruin the process and
the sour cream doesn't Gel properly.<BR>
 <BR>- Let me tell you, this is the most delicious sour cream anyone has ever
had, because it is PURE. Take a look at the labels of all the commercial
sour cream in the stores. It is loaded with all kinds of crappy additives
and thickeners. The homemade kind has no lactose, as far as I know (and it
has never bothered my stomach), and it is perfectly thick and tastes exactly
like real sour cream, not yogurty.
 <BR>- I encourage everyone to try it. There are TONS of dishes that can be
improved with sour cream. Let me know how it goes if anyone decides to try
it. <BR>
