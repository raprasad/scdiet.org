<B>Sleep problems</B><BR>

I saw a comment concerning a possible connection between Crohn's <BR>
and disturbed sleep patterns. <BR>
I have had Crohn's -diagnosed for 5 years, undiagnosed for much longer <BR>
and have had distubed sleeped for much of the time. <BR>
Anyone else have a problem with sleep? <BR>
A bell went off in my head when I read about a possible connection.<BR>

I'd like to see that article. I noticed that whenever I get a flare I have<BR>
trouble sleeping. I am restless, tossing and turning, and keep waking up<BR>
throughout the night. The worst thing though is the nightmares, which I
have<BR>
heard can be related to the inflammation going on in the colon. Has anyone<BR>
else heard anything about nightmares in relation to IBD? I heard that you
can<BR>
get nightmares when you have a flare up. I used to think it was Prednisone<BR>
related (all the sleeping problems and the nightmares), but I've been off
it<BR>
for a year now and when I got a flare the nightmares came again. <BR>

I too would be extremely interested in learning more about Crohn's being<BR>
linked to sleep problems. I have had trouble falling asleep and<BR>
sometimes staying asleep ever since the onset of my symptoms (I only<BR>
have the vague diagnosis of IBS but my mom has Crohn's) six years ago. <BR>
I have been searching for a long time to find some connection or link,<BR>
because it was obvious to me that they were related. When my gut<BR>
started healing I started sleeping well again, when I have a flare of<BR>
diahrea or even constipation, I have trouble again. Where did you read<BR>
about the connection? Thanks for sharing your insight.<BR>

Dear Carol:  <BR>
<BR>
	I gradually deteriorated from being a sound sleeper to every small<BR>
movement waking me about 10 years after I was diagnosed with UC and Crohn's.
 I<BR>
was told it was early menapause (I was 42 at the time) and started taking<BR>
hormones (estrogen and progestin).  I spent the last two years trying to
find<BR>
the right dose and have finally settled on two 1mg./day patches per week
(brand<BR>
Climara) and 20 mg. of progestin per day.  <BR>
<BR>
	But, even while having real dosage problems, my sleeping patterns were<BR>
much better until I had a flare up in February.  (That's what led me to
find and<BR>
Dear Carol:  <BR>
<BR>
	I gradually deteriorated from being a sound sleeper to every small<BR>

<BR>
	But, even while having real dosage problems, my sleeping patterns were<BR>
much better until I had a flare up in February.  (That's what led me to
find and<BR>
begin the diet).  <BR>
<BR>
	While there may be other reasons to consider whether or not to take<BR>
estrogen, I found it really does help me to sleep better.  <BR>
<BR>
	BTW, the gastroenterologist and the gynecologist seem to be competing for<BR>
who gets to claim my symptoms.  I experienced severe muscle weakness for
months<BR>
before I realized how sick I was.  I've been told both that it was Crohn's
and<BR>
that it is peri-menapause.  <BR>
<BR>
	At this point, I don't really care which it is so long as something helps<BR>
me sleep.  I've made other changes as well:  my husband goes to the guest
room<BR>
with his snoring and fidgeting and the dog now sleeps in the kitchen.  Ah,<BR>
privacy and quiet.  <BR>
<BR>
	As to Anna's remarks about nightmares, I've been having terrible dreams<BR>
in the last couple of hours before I wake up every single night since February.<BR>
Even when I take a sleeping pill I still have weird, distressing dreams.
 I'm<BR>
sure it is the disease and not the drugs.  <BR>
<BR>
	Well, we know that our warranty runs out when we turn 40 so humor is the<BR>
best weapon we have left.  <BR>
