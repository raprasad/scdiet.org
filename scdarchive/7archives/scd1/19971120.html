&gt; we have to make sure we cover ALL ground on the mercury issue. NONE of<BR>
&gt; my<BR>
&gt; hair analysis have showed levels of mercury YET there are cavitations<BR>
&gt; worth<BR>
&gt; mentioning. People get confused and will go out and take a hair<BR>
&gt; analysis test<BR>
&gt; and when it comes back negative (because metals DO NOT show up<BR>
&gt; normally on<BR>
&gt; the first test at all, not to mention until you start mobilizing<BR>
&gt; them), they<BR>
&gt; will think they don't have the problem or A problem. there are three<BR>
&gt; things<BR>
&gt; that need to be addressed in the mercury-link: 1) mercury fillings<BR>
&gt; (same as<BR>
&gt; silver fillings) 2) cavitations 3) root canals. If the whole issue<BR>
&gt; isnt<BR>
&gt; addressed INCLUDING CHELATING IT OUT once it is removed, you cannot<BR>
&gt; improve.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; mercury DOES NOT BELONG in the body and encourages cavitations and<BR>
&gt; resistant<BR>
&gt; bacteria. why mess with it? im not even questioning tests - im just<BR>
&gt; having<BR>
&gt; them removed.<BR>

&gt; snip<BR>
&gt; &gt; Also, SCD tends to be a fairly low residue<BR>
&gt; &gt;type diet so it will not cause there to be huge amounts of stool. At<BR>
&gt; &gt;least it does not with me. Perhaps, others can comment on this too??<BR>
&gt; snip<BR>
&gt; &gt;Whatever, I would encourage you to fell encouraged with the progress<BR>
&gt; &gt;that you are experiencing with your son! Hang in there!<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Pat<BR>
&gt; Pat and the group.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thank you Pat for inviting comments on the above statement, it allows<BR>
&gt; me<BR>
&gt; the opportunity to reply to the subject without feeling I am being<BR>
&gt; controversial.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Shortly after reaching a point where the Ulcerative Colitis showed<BR>
&gt; signs<BR>
&gt; of improvement and even to this day in full remission I am always<BR>
&gt; amazed at<BR>
&gt; the large volume of stool that I produce on the SCDiet. I would<BR>
&gt; estimate<BR>
&gt; some thing in the order of three times the volume as when pre SCD<BR>
&gt; days. With<BR>
&gt; regularity to the hour once each day, absolutely no discomfort and<BR>
&gt; easily<BR>
&gt; passed. Well formed but not as a hard material .<BR>
&gt; I remain on the SCDiet to-day, (other than one small square of<BR>
&gt; chocolate<BR>
&gt; some days) I eat more than my share of nuts, approx 2 teaspoons of<BR>
&gt; honey a<BR>
&gt; day perhaphs 4 to 6 apples 2 or 3 bannanas, some days oranges. But the<BR>
&gt; main<BR>
&gt; stay is mixed vegetables. I alternated between frozen for one meal<BR>
&gt; then for<BR>
&gt; the next meal I will eat fresh chopped up vegetables cooked up in<BR>
&gt; olive oil.<BR>
&gt; All types of squashes, meat , chicken, or fish every day . I do<BR>
&gt; notice the<BR>
&gt; stool will reflect any changes I might make to the above diet.<BR>
&gt; eg. if I eat a larger amout of meat than I would normally or<BR>
&gt; unbalance the<BR>
&gt; fruits and vegetables. My bads habits ..... I drink 3 or more cups of<BR>
&gt; weak<BR>
&gt; coffee a day and other than the liquid in it I dont need it and may<BR>
&gt; have to<BR>
&gt; stop. I do feel great most of the time .<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I am wondering if any one else in the group has found the same?<BR>

Thanks prateeksha,<BR>
<BR>
I'm going to try the 1/2 and 1/2 for milk. I haven't experimented much with<BR>
the diet. I'm very busy (and lazy). Breakfast is yogurt and coffee, lunch<BR>
is always chicken breasts and peas, and dinner is steak, fish or more<BR>
chicken. I tried the muffins (with home ground nuts, I didn't like them, or<BR>
the texture., with the store bought nut flour is it the same consistence as<BR>
real flour?? ) I can't find the dry curd/bakers cheese/ farmers friendly<BR>
cheese to make the cheesecake, and some of the other cheese based goodies.<BR>
 Although I have become rather addicted to the honey/peanut butter cookies.<BR>
 Those are great.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>

&gt; &gt;	I am confused by your response. You ask &quot;Anyway, do you have<BR>

&gt; your<BR>
&gt; &gt;last posting. <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;	Again, as noted I am not aware of where Elaine says no SBOS.<BR>
&gt; &gt;Also, where do you suppose that your son got exposed to Mercury if no<BR>
&gt; &gt;amalgams? Does he eat a lot of fish?? esp Tuna??<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;	Hope this clears up any confusion.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;	Pat<BR>
&gt; Dear Pat, <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks for your response, I don't know how I missed it the first time,<BR>
&gt; maybe<BR>
&gt; mercury brain fog.&lt;grin&gt; [Pat Sullivan] I know the feeling! <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think my son may have gotten mercury in utero, remember, I had<BR>
&gt; cancer when<BR>
&gt; he was in utero. Also, I have lots of mercury amalgams in my molars.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Finally, being on antibiotics for so long, and having dysbiosis for so<BR>
&gt; long,<BR>
&gt; his body could not move out any toxic metals. [Pat Sullivan]<BR>
&gt; Possible. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Not only that, remember, we live next door to a neighbor who has been<BR>
&gt; doing<BR>
&gt; heavy pesticide spraying every 2 weeks for the past 20 plus years, do<BR>
&gt; pesticides contain mercury?? [Pat Sullivan] A lot of them do! <BR>
&gt; Would mercury toxicity cause his tactile defensiveness?? He can't<BR>
&gt; stand it<BR>
&gt; if you touch his head, it is painful to him. [Pat Sullivan] Possibly.<BR>
&gt; Mercury is a nasty thing and you can't predict where in the body it<BR>
&gt; may end up and affect. No way that I know of for sure to tell.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
	I am finding that SCD and working at helping my body get rid of<BR>
Hg slowly is helping me with a multitude of symptoms but not the one<BR>
your son has. I would suggest that you keep on plugging away with SCD<BR>
and learn more about Hg. SCD, though is a big, big answer for me and I<BR>
would imagine for your son as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I finally got the spraying stopped, after I told the neighbor my son<BR>
&gt; had<BR>
&gt; seizures from it. [Pat Sullivan] Great neighbor! Some would not have<BR>
&gt; stopped!! <BR>

Mike,<BR>
<BR>
lots of eggs, lots of butter, essential oils, fish oil (mercury free!),<BR>
pecans,walnuts, fruit and vegies, meat, honey water and SCD-zucchini<BR>
muffins allowed me to stop weight loss and got me back to maintaining my<BR>
weight where it should be. I got to work at eating more cause complex<BR>
carbs used to fill me up faster and make me fat! Now, with no Complex<BR>
Carbs, seems I got to eat more often and more of it. 3 meals and 1-2<BR>
snacks per day.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this give you some ideas!<BR>

<BR>
I've seen a couple of postings about swollen feet, and a lot of theories<BR>
about what the cause could be. If my son's experience is anything to go by,<BR>
it's likely to be just a symptom of gut inflamation. When Matt had his<BR>
problems this past winter and spring which led up to his CD diagnossis, we<BR>
had no idea that he had an intestinal problem. His symptoms were: sore<BR>
knees, shoulders, and other joints, mild temperature, weight loss, lesions<BR>
on his legs and feet(they were discolored swellings actually), and swollen<BR>
feet. He had to wear sandals to school most days for a while. A<BR>
rheumatologist looked him over, and sent us straight to the GI doctor.<BR>
Since getting his gut inflamation under control, his joint pain is minimal<BR>
and intermittent, He's growing and gaining weight, he has no temp, and he<BR>
has no swelling in his feet<BR>

not the best idea to keep infreezer more then 5 weeks and don't refrigerate<BR>
longer then date..keep it air tight as well as the air makes it go bad<BR>
faster.<BR>
<BR>
three pounds is alot to buy at one time..<BR>
<BR>
The COUNTRY FARM BRAND is in 1 pound package and is very SMOOTH in texture<BR>
not curdy and great for cheesecakes. <BR>

Again the company number is 914 632-9656 <BR>

Dear Mike,<BR>
<BR>
I think you'll love the yogurt made with the 1/2 and 1/2! It gives it such<BR>
a creamy, wonderful texture.<BR>
<BR>
From the looks of things, no wonder you don't gain weight!!! And, eat more<BR>
veggies, buddy! Yes, the texture of the blanched, ground almond flour you<BR>
can buy at Hughson Nut Company (address, tele. no. in book) is far superior<BR>
to anything I ever ground here at home! Not to mention the time you<BR>
save!!! Some people have made very interesting comments on this list re<BR>
the way they store it, too! Are you drinking caffeinated coffee for<BR>
breakfast?Where do you live? Perhaps someone in the group lives in your<BR>
area and could tell you where to go to get your DCCC. Try the banana bread<BR>
made with chopped pecans, in the mini loaf pans...if you want a fanatastic<BR>
treat!<BR>

&gt;Thanks prateeksha,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm going to try the 1/2 and 1/2 for milk. I haven't experimented much with<BR>
&gt;the diet. I'm very busy (and lazy). Breakfast is yogurt and coffee, lunch<BR>
&gt;is always chicken breasts and peas, and dinner is steak, fish or more<BR>
&gt;chicken. I tried the muffins (with home ground nuts, I didn't like them, or<BR>
&gt;the texture., with the store bought nut flour is it the same consistence as<BR>
&gt;real flour?? ) I can't find the dry curd/bakers cheese/ farmers friendly<BR>
&gt;cheese to make the cheesecake, and some of the other cheese based goodies.<BR>
&gt; Although I have become rather addicted to the honey/peanut butter cookies.<BR>
&gt; Those are great.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks<BR>

&lt;&lt; When Matt had his<BR>
 problems this past winter and spring which led up to his CD diagnossis, we<BR>
 had no idea that he had an intestinal problem. His symptoms were: sore<BR>
 knees, shoulders, and other joints, &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi, it's Simone again.<BR>
<BR>
 Someone who's name fails me, suggested foot swelling could be a foot problem<BR>
which a podiatrist may be able to help. What I did not mention is that<BR>
besides the feet hurting, I often have problems with my knees, elbows, and<BR>
often wrists. I was pain and swelling free for over a week, but now<BR>
everything is back with a vengence. I can't help but relate it to CD.<BR>
<BR>
I had previously lead a very active life, always on my feet....with no<BR>
problem what so ever. Even around the time when the pain in my feet and<BR>
joints started, I was no longer as active as before, and have been kind of<BR>
imoblile ever since.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for all your input. I wish it was an easy solution.<BR>

Simone:<BR>
&gt;I will look into the book you mentioned, but my mom already has the original<BR>
&gt;Sweedish Bitters recipe and has a bunch of it already made. But it tastes<BR>
&gt;something awful. Since it's made with alcohol (vodka), I keep getting drunk<BR>
&gt;off one simple dose (1 Tbs in a cup of tea 3 times a day). Besides, I didn't<BR>
&gt;know the effect of alcohol on my compromised CD colon, so now I am<BR>
&gt;considering applying it on my abdomen and letting it absorb through the skin.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Any take on that?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
I'm not sure which herbs take better in alcohol, oil, or water of those in<BR>
the Swedish Bitters. Generally, if a person is alcohol intolerant, they put<BR>
the drops of the tincture in very hot water and let the alcohol burn off. I<BR>
think your idea of putting it on the skin is great. The skin is far more<BR>
absorbent that I ever realized. Sandra Duggan has written a book...Edgar<BR>
Cayce's Complete Colon Care (or something like that...I believe she went<BR>
through his works and culled out all the intestinal stuff) and I know he<BR>
was big into the castor oil compresses across the abdomen to break up all<BR>
the junk in the intestines and even liver.<BR>

&gt;Maybe someone can straighten me out. Odwalla makes a limeade type of drink<BR>

<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
I think I'd get on the phone to Odwalla and find out what's in it, what's<BR>
making it so sweet. As much as I'd like to be in pulque-honey heaven, I<BR>

Dear Annie,<BR>
Dry curd cottage cheese looks just like regular cottage cheese minus the<BR>
creamy- milky base. So all you should see is curds. I haven't used<BR>
Farmer's cheese yet, it sounds like it is has a smooth texture instead of<BR>
curds. I would<BR>
imagine that they aren't identical in flavor. Lately there has been some<BR>
talk about<BR>
not freezing dccc past it's expiration date. I've found that it freezes<BR>
just fine. I do usually use it within 2 or 3 months of freezing. I don't<BR>
know about dccc in other <BR>
parts, but here in WA state I have found that the dccc usually goes bad<BR>
before <BR>
the expiration date. I have more than once bought it spoiled with up to 4<BR>
days left on the date. So now I don't buy it unless it has at least 6<BR>
days to go before the expiration date. Knowing how easily it spoils if I<BR>
use only half of it in a recipe, I will freeze <BR>
the rest right away. Maybe the person who wrote in saying it doesn't<BR>
freeze well actually froze it after it had started turning and then<BR>
thought it had spoiled in the freezer. <BR>
Good luck.<BR>

&gt;I am confused about this product. In the stores in Ann Arbor, I have <BR>

&gt;something that says Dry Curd Cottage Cheese in the refrig seciton, but <BR>
&gt;it<BR>
&gt;also says contains 1/2% milkfat and looks like small curd cottage <BR>
&gt;chess.<BR>
&gt;Is this what is ok to use?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I recently found Farmers Cheese. It's packaged as a block and has no<BR>

A question for the gals of the group: did or do any of you have chronic<BR>
bladder infections that cleared up with the SCD? I have. Mine are<BR>
still reoccurring on and off though, altho' they are less frequent by<BR>
far. I have a feeling that the SCD must affect the bladder bacteria as<BR>

Pastry ( for a 9-inch double-crust pie) From the Mennonite Community=<BR>
 Cookbook<BR>
<BR>
2=BC cups almond flour<BR>
2/3 cup shortning - I use butter<BR>
=BD teaspoon salt<BR>
1/3 cup water<BR>
Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut shortening (butter slightly<BR>
melted) into flour with a pastry blender or two knives. Do not over mix;<BR>
these are sufficiently blended when particles ar the size of peas. Add<BR>
water gradually, sprinkling a little at a time over the mixture. Use only<BR>
enough water to hold the pastry together when it is pressed between the<BR>
fingers. It should not feel wet. Roll dough ino a round ball, handling as<BR>
little as possible. Roll out on a lightly floured board into a circle 1/8<BR>
in thick and one inch larger than the diameter of the top of the pie pan.<BR>
(I roll between two pieces of waxed paper to help handling and cleaning up<BR>
then I strip off on side of the waxed paper transport it to the pie pan and<BR>
press it in). trim to the edge of the pie pan. Prick with a fork. Each<BR>
person has their own pattern of fork pricks on the pie crust. The artistry<BR>
of each individual is different. Bake at 450=BA for 12 - 15 minutes or<BR>
until a golden brown.<BR>
<BR>
Honey Baked Lentils (from More with Less Cookbook)<BR>
Combine in a dutch oven or sauce pan:<BR>
1 lb. (21/3 cups) lentils - orange ones would add color<BR>
1 small bay leaf<BR>
5 c. water<BR>

1 t. dry mustard<BR>
=BC t powdered ginger<BR>
1 T soy sauce (optional not sure if it is legal)<BR>
=BD c. chopped onions<BR>
2 cups water<BR>
4 slices bacon cut in one inch pieces ( stir most of the bacon into the<BR>
lentils but sprinkle remainder on top. You can substitute browned ground<BR>
beef or sliced pieces of sausage from whole foods.<BR>
Pour over all 1/3 cup honey<BR>
Cover tightly and bake one hour at 350=BA serves 8. uncover last ten=<BR>

Dear Mike,<BR>
<BR>
I think Moira lives in San Francisco; perhaps she could tell you where she<BR>
gets the DCCC. It's possible that you could call them Monday, ask them<BR>
whey their delivery is, and ask that they order an extra # or so for you to<BR>
take home with you, if they don't get in very much. My Whole Foods Grocery<BR>
gets an order of Friendship Farmer's cheese every Tuesday and Thursday. I<BR>
go on one of those days and get the 3# block; have them package it in<BR>
small, 1/2# packages; take it home, wrap it in small freezer plastic bags<BR>
and freeze it; take a package out as I need it. It does freeze 2 or 3<BR>
months without any problem.<BR>

&gt;I drink caffeinated coffee. It's a strange thing, before the diet I drank my<BR>
&gt;coffee with sugar and milk. I thought it was the caffein giving me diarrhea.<BR>
&gt; Since the diet I'm fine with coffee. IT WAS THE SUGAR AND MILK!!<BR>
&gt;I live in L.A. I checked on the list once before and couldn't find anyone<BR>
&gt;local with a DCCC connection. Some San Diego's and San Francisco's.<BR>
&gt; Actually I'm going to be in San Francisco next week I should look for a<BR>
&gt;place there and bring a bag of nut flour back.<BR>
&gt;I do need to start expanding my food intake to include some more things. I<BR>

I think Elaine says best to not take caffein since caffein is a stimulate<BR>
of the bowels - and for those of us who have chronic diarrhea, we don't<BR>
need this!!!!<BR>
<BR>
However, she does mention that if you take coffee, it should only be taken<BR>
after diarrhea is finished and then very weak.<BR>
<BR>
Better yet, just decaffeinated.<BR>
<BR>
I am a real coffee lover, especially cappucino's,ummmmmm. BUT, I'M NOT<BR>
DRINKING EVEN DECAFFEINATED, as my intuition tells me NO!!!!! So, I have<BR>
become a tea drinker.<BR>

Hi, this is Isabella here.<BR>
<BR>
Can anyone advise me on which is the best yogurt maker?<BR>
Someone gave a recipe for making yogurt in a double boiler which I<BR>
missed would really appreciate if you could send it again!<BR>
 <BR>
I have just been reading about one called Yogourmet Multi yogurt maker<BR>
which sounds impressive because it will also make a yogurt from a<BR>
'casei bifidus acidophilus' yogurt starter, and according to the<BR>
manufacturers this requires 12 to 15 hours incubation during which <BR>
time the temperature must be increased gradually from 23-44 degs C.<BR>
I like the sound of using 3 different types of culture rather than<BR>
just one. I think the texture of yogurt is also affected by which<BR>
type of culture is used and read something about this in a book some<BR>
years ago called PROBIOTICS written by an employee of the Natren <BR>
company, which though that could cause some bias was a very good read.<BR>
<BR>
Would appreciate comments.<BR>

Apparently your computer did not translate the fractions that are available<BR>
but not normally on the keyboard. Your BC = 1/4, and BD = 1/2. Thank you<BR>

Dear Simone,<BR>
I've been down your road with the foot pain &amp; I know from personal<BR>
experience what a nightmare it can be. Does it feel like a taut wire (both<BR>
physically &amp; to the touch) running from just under the ball under your big<BR>
toe to where your heel begins? I ran the gambit trying to find releif from<BR>
this pain. A freind who is a chiropractor was convinced it was (I probably<BR>
have the term wrong) something to do with the &quot;fascia&quot;, and gave me deep<BR>
painfull massages. The pain proceeded to get worse. I went to the<BR>
rhuemetoligist, (because of the UC connection) who did bloodwork &amp; said I<BR>
was HLA-B27 positive and said I have arthritis connected to my UC &amp; sent me<BR>
for physical therapy. No help whatsoever! Eventually I went to a podiatrist<BR>
(also a freind) who knew my UC/HLA-B27 history, said that my feet were in<BR>
really bad shape because of this, put these kind of soft casts on my feet,<BR>
changing the tape every few days. Then he prescribed orthotics (specially<BR>
designed shoe inserts made from an exact mold of your foot) and this is<BR>
what eventually abated the pain. If your pain is what I described, I hope<BR>
this can save you from some of what I've had to go through. Lots of luck!<BR>

Dear Simone,<BR>
Just got to your second letter (I've been on vacation all week &amp; am<BR>
laboriously going thru last weeks stuff). Again, all that joint pain is<BR>
exactlly what I had. Please have a blood test done for HLA-B27. Not that<BR>
there's anything they can do if you have spondylitis or any of the other<BR>
IBD associated arthritis, but knowing does help. You say you lead an active<BR>
life, well I've been practicing martial arts for many years and will<BR>
continue to do so in spite of my arthritis and frankly, I strongly beleive<BR>
that this is what has kept me mobile. PLease keep me posted.<BR>

anyone has ever made bread dressing from the bread in the book. I am<BR>

going to use the receipe for soft bread that Joan sent on the list Sunday<BR>
Nov. 23. Also I would like to know if anyone has made the Lemon<BR>
Souffle and if they have is it good? I am also going to try to make a<BR>
sweet potato casserole using butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes. <BR>
I am going out of town for thanksgiving, but I plan on cooking my own<BR>
stuff. I just don't trust others. I will let ya'll know how the<BR>
dressing and casserole turned out. If it turns out good I will send the<BR>
receipes. Hope everyone has a great holiday!<BR>

Well, the big thanksgiving dinner is fast approaching. I just tried the<BR>
mock mashed potatoes using califlower and it was an excellent<BR>
substitute. It was very easy to make -- so IMO, its just not worth<BR>
breaking the diet just for the mashed potatoes.<BR>
<BR>
I think many of us are in a real difficult situation with the diet and<BR>
this holiday. Personally, I'm worried about pleasing my parents -- I can<BR>
see how unhappy they are at the fact that many foods are off limits to<BR>
me, that somehow this will make the holiday less of a celebration. You<BR>
would not believe how happy they were that I was able to have roast beef<BR>
and mashed &quot;potatoes&quot; with them Saturday night!<BR>
<BR>
My main consession on the diet is going to be the gravy. The small<BR>
amount of cornstarch is not going to kill me. I'm probably going to<BR>
make the cranberry recipe in the book and have some wine. Hopefully,<BR>
this will appease all present and insure them that I am in fact having a<BR>
wonderful thanksgiving.<BR>
<BR>
How does food become this important in our lives? How's everyone<BR>
else's plans coming along?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to you all ....<BR>

In the web site look under the about the author section. This was supposed to be <BR>
retitled but has not been done yet. This section has the short biography of Dr. Haas <BR>
who invented the SCD.<BR>

&gt; Hi John,<BR>
&gt; I just got back from vacation &amp; saw your post about Dr. Hass's book. Please<BR>
&gt; let me know more about it. Does it go into much about the diet or his<BR>
&gt; problems promoting it, or is it basically a biography. I checked your<BR>
&gt; website but couldn't find out about this book. Hope all is well with you.<BR>

I am still having trouble keeping weight on, so I'm not a big help there.<BR>
I found that although at first my energy level dropped off dramatically<BR>
on the diet, after being on it a while, I have felt my energy level<BR>
increase somewhat. I used to be an avid exerciser also, but since I got<BR>
sick, I haven't done much, just because I've felt so badly. I am hoping I<BR>
will eventually get back to my old routine, once I put the lost weight<BR>
back on and things normalize. I find that eating lots of small meals,<BR>
with a lot of protein, seems to keep me going. Hope this is of some<BR>
help.<BR>

This appears to be a common situation (I will not call it a problem) during<BR>
the early days of the diet. Everybody responds differently and like our<BR>
experience, looking back we were concerned also. What you have to realize<BR>
is that these &quot;diseases&quot; often took years to manifest themselves, you, like<BR>
others may have overlooked the early symptoms. So it will take (for some)<BR>
time to stop the slide downhill and pick up going uphill. Unlike other diets<BR>
the SCD works to alter the unhealthy biochemistry of the GI tract. This<BR>
takes time as unhealthy bacteria is displaced and the healthy bacteria take<BR>
up residence again. The diet will work gradually to correct the balance in<BR>
your intestine, all we can say is hang in there, we are sure it will get<BR>
better. The weight loss will stabalize, you will put on weight and the<BR>
strength and endurance will gradually return. Be prepared to measure<BR>
progress, perhaps in terms of months rather than days and weeks. <BR>
<BR>
The diet is not the reason for your loss of weight, it is the effect of what<BR>
is going on in your GI tract. The diet is rich in appropriate<BR>
carbohydrates, high in protein and swimming in trace minerals. Stick with<BR>
it, it will pay off. We found that it took time to get things on track for<BR>
Martine, she was depleted at all levels, it takes time to get things back on<BR>
track especially if you are not absorbing due to mucus build up or a fast<BR>
transition time. <BR>

Karen wrote about stuffing etc,<BR>
<BR>
We have just enjoyed (not Thanksgiving) a Turkey dinner with gravy prepared<BR>
from the stock with onions which was pureed. The surprising thing was that<BR>
it tasted better than the gravy made with cornstarch/flour/etc. Also, we<BR>
have a suasage meat recipe that, along with some almond flour was baked and<BR>
had some stock added to it to make a stuffing. It was delicious!! - The<BR>
other benefit was that we did not have that &quot;stuffed&quot; feeling afterwards!!<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Can anyone advise me on which is the best yogurt maker?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
 We also would recommend that one definitely go with the yogurmet II, it<BR>
makes excellent yougurt and keeps the temp. consistent. We use plain<BR>
yougurt as a starter, ensuring the starter meets SCD requirments. It is a<BR>
compact unit and does not need to be fussed with, is easy to clean and<BR>
sterilize.<BR>
 <BR>
We leave ours 48 hours regardless of manufacturers instructions, while this<BR>
may seem excessive to some, it is because Martine has a severe LI and we<BR>
just want to make sure all the lactose is coverted as much as possible.<BR>

&gt;If you are drying meats yourself (perhaps with a good ol' Ronco), there<BR>
&gt;should not be a problem as long as the curing mix you use is free of harsh<BR>
&gt;chemicals and illegal ingredients. I would, however, be very cautious about<BR>
&gt;packaged 'dried' or 'dehydrated' meats as they often contain nasty things.<BR>
&gt; Anyone else have details?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Excellent point. I was in the butcher shop today and they make their own,<BR>
highly touted, jerky and pemmican.<BR>
<BR>
But I looked at the ingredients. Guess what not only was it loaded with<BR>
sugar, but also MSG (monosodium glutamate) a known neurotoxin!<BR>
<BR>
It is best and easy to make your own, I add nothing to it! You could add<BR>
some dried fruits, I do add a tiny bit of salt.<BR>

Hi Mike,<BR>
<BR>
The nut company in SF is Cal. Nut Co. tele. # 415/ 243-0320. Contact<BR>
person: Motzi Dorudian. About $86 for 25#. Don't know if they sell it in<BR>
smaller lots or not.<BR>
<BR>
I have never used this nut co. Use Hughson Nut Co. which is listed in the<BR>
book. Order it at the same price and quantity as Cal Nut. Co.<BR>
<BR>
Re a source for DCCC in the city, I only have an old yellow pages telephone<BR>
directory and neither Whole Foods nor Real Foods is listed in the<BR>
Grocers-Retail section; however, when you get to SF, just look in the<BR>
yellow pages and see if you can find one of these; Whole Foods if you can<BR>
find one, would come nearer to having the DCCC I imagine. I know there is<BR>
a Real Foods on Sutter Street, going toward downtown away from Van Ness on<BR>
the left; nice store.<BR>
<BR>
That's all the help I am able to give you...sorry couldn't do more for you.<BR>
Good luck!<BR>
<BR>
Happy Turkey Day,<BR>
