<BR>&gt; I too am guilty of being one of those so called pros. I work as a data base

<BR>Diane,
<BR>
<BR>Perhaps it's not the computers but the fact that you computer people (like
<BR>me - an environmental consultant) spend much of your day sitting still! The
<BR>reason I say this is that I read the following in a little book my Dad has
<BR>(in his loo - where else!):
<BR>
<BR>&quot;Men [presumably women too] who spend most of their working day sitting
<BR>behind a desk have a much higher risk of developing colon cancer than those
<BR>whose jobs require more strenuous physical activity - that's the conclusion
<BR>reached at the end of a special study of the illness.
<BR>
<BR>'Knowing about this link could lead to prevention of the disease by
<BR>encouraging the desk-bound to take up suitable exercises' said Dr David
<BR>Garabrant, a specialist in preventive medecine at the University of
<BR>California in Los Angeles.&quot; ('Little Known Health Remedies' by Bill Habets,
<BR>1994. Carnell Ltd., London.)
<BR>
<BR>This is obviously only one factor in IBD and doesn't explain Chrons in
<BR>children for example. But it has made me think hard about my own lifestyle
<BR>as the onset of my colitis followed a number of years where I was tied to a
<BR>desk, using a computer and working under pressure. Previously I was much
<BR>more physically active and was out in the open a lot carrying out bird
<BR>surveys. 
<BR>
<BR>I use the computer regularly and am conscious of the adverse health effects
<BR>of electro-magnetic radiation from conventional CRT monitors. I try to use
<BR>my laptop where possible for word processing and have seriously considered
<BR>purchasing an LCD screen to replace my existing monitor.

<BR>Another computer programmer here. My first programming job started in
<BR>1966. My Crohn's also started in 1966. 
<BR>
<BR>So, which caused which? We shouldn't be careful about this though since
<BR>a mail list discussion like this will by definition be populated with
<BR>people that work with computers.
