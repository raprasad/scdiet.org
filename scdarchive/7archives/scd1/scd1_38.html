Hi --<BR>
<BR>
I was wondering if someone could describe just how large 25 pounds of almond<BR>
flour is?  (Bigger than a breadbox?? ;-)   How do you all store it??  I've<BR>
been grinding my own, but remarks about the finer texture and lighter baked<BR>
goods are tempting me to order some from Hughson's.  It's just the<BR>
enormous-sounding quantity that scares me!<BR>
<BR>

Dear Debbie,<BR>
<BR>
My experience is that there is simply no comparison between home-ground nut<BR>
flour and that you can buy from Hughson Nut Company (almond flour); and<BR>
almond flour has a much better texture (more similar to wheat flour) than<BR>
pecan meal which I Also ordered from Dutch Valley Nut Co.  I would not both<BR>
with the pecan meal; but definitely go for the 25 pound lot of almond flour<BR>
at Hughson Nut Company and package it like Rachel does (me, too now) in<BR>
plastic bags in 3 cup quantities. Stack in the freezer and take out as you<BR>
need.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck.<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Hello &amp; thanks to all who answered my questions,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have tried several of the book's recipes with varying results. The<BR>
&gt;basic nut muffins &amp; the stir fry came out great. The zucchini pizza<BR>
&gt;crust &amp; the almond honey crisps were awful.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Possibly the problem with the pizza was that I used frozen,thawed grated<BR>
&gt;zucchini. I will use fresh next time. The crisps were just a runny,<BR>
&gt;soupy mess that my husband used as an ice cream topping. Any<BR>
&gt;suggestions?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm wondering if the consistency of home-ground nut flour and bought<BR>
&gt;flour is that big of a diff. I almost cried at the waste of it. Here in<BR>
&gt;NC, almonds are $7.99/lb. and I lost half of what I had in the &quot;bad&quot;<BR>
&gt;recipes. Could this be what went wrong?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks,<BR>

&gt;Dear Dan,<BR>
<BR>
I'm very forgetful and have burned a lot of food until I started using a<BR>
small kitchen timer and I set it and take it with me when I am away from<BR>
the kitchen for any length of time...watching tv, watering plants, yard,<BR>
etc. so I don't get involved and forget and burn the food.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe this would help you.<BR>

Hi group,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Well seems that staying up late has price to it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The last three nights I've stayed up 'till midnight making SCD<BR>
&gt;food. This includes 2 weeks supply of soup, 3-4 weeks of hamburgers,<BR>
&gt;cheese cake, home-made grape jello, yogurt, and last night the<BR>
&gt;date-filled cookies (without the dates).  Well, last night we<BR>
&gt;had a visitor until 11pm and I still wanted to make my cookies<BR>
&gt;after since I was taking Friday off from work.  After putting in<BR>
&gt;my 3rd batch (2 dozen at a time) of cookies, I went downstairs to<BR>
&gt;watch TV.  Twoo hours later I realized that I had fallen asleep<BR>
&gt;and there was a funny smell in the house.  I burnt my cookies !<BR>
&gt;What a waste :(<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am sure many of you can relate to this !<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks... Dan.<BR>

&gt;When my first 25 pounds came a couple of weeks ago, it measured about<BR>
&gt;4&quot;high and 18&quot; long and 10-12&quot; deep in the plastic bag it was wrapped in<BR>
&gt;inside the cardboard box.  If you store it in the small plastic zip lock<BR>
&gt;bags, 3 cups at a time and stack it in the freezer, it doesn't take up as<BR>
&gt;much space as plastic containers which I first tried and soon ran out of<BR>
&gt;room!  I have a small freezer in the top of my fridge and all 25 pounds<BR>
&gt;went in there; but not much else!  So, I have basically given up my<BR>
&gt;freezer to nut flour!<BR>

I can really relate!!  It's amazing how much cooking it takes to keep up with<BR>
this (and the related potential for kitchen accidents).  Tonight I came home<BR>
from work planning to have meatloaf for supper that I made last night.  I<BR>
only needed to make ketchup to go with it.  Luckily I had already bought a<BR>
bunch of fresh tomatoes to make it with.  I scalded them, peeled them,<BR>
chopped them, and boiled them up.  Added seasoning, reduced it a bit, and<BR>
then poured the boiling mass into the blender.  I put the top on and held it<BR>
down, turned on the blender, and the force was tremendous!  It sprayed<BR>
scalding tomatoes all over me and all over the kitchen.  My face and one arm<BR>
were immediately painful.  My housemate ended up helping me get ice on my<BR>
face and cleaning up most of the mess.  It was pretty traumatic.  He finished<BR>
the blending and I had supper (after I changed clothes, put on salve, cleaned<BR>
tomatoes out of my hair....)  When I finished supper I decided to avoid the<BR>
kitchen for the rest of the night and get in bed with a book.  <BR>
<BR>
This is the only group I could admit this to!  <BR>
<BR>
My housemate says I should buy a food processor and that way these things<BR>
won't happen.  He says that with a food processor, the ingredients are locked<BR>
in and won't push their way out.  Is he right?  Would this be a wise<BR>
investment in my personal safety?  (I keep thinking I'll get used to using<BR>
the blender for such things but this is my second disaster)<BR>

That could be part of it (I haven't tried grinding my own yet though--perhaps<BR>
others will comment).  I also haven't yet tried the cited recipes (again I<BR>
hope others will comment--I'd like to try these too)<BR>
<BR>
Basically, trying to use almond flour in place of grain flour is very<BR>
challenging since they are very different substances and behave very<BR>
differently in cooking.  Almond flour looks like a dry ingredient but, in<BR>
reality, is 60% oil.  (You may have already noticed that it has a tendency to<BR>
turn into almond butter when over processed).  Anything that makes the recipe<BR>
either wetter or more oily can cause problems (frozen grated zuchinni is<BR>
probably &quot;wetter&quot; than fresh grated).  Different levels of processing<BR>
probably also vary its properties.<BR>
<BR>
I know what you mean about the tragedy of wasting it.  It's expensive, and<BR>
the process of the baking takes a lot of time and effort as well.  Don't be<BR>
hard on yourself though.  I think we've all had recipes turn out really badly<BR>
on this diet.  I think it's tricky to make some of these things work--getting<BR>
just the right balance--and it's possible that even high humidity could cause<BR>
a problem if the recipe is particularly sensitive.  As time goes on, you'll<BR>
find those that work well consistently and find workarounds to improve<BR>
others.  This group is a good place to find those.<BR>
<BR>
Best of luck to you,<BR>

&gt; Has anyone else had this &quot;bloating&quot; problem?  I was having it when I was<BR>
&gt; not quite in the state of remission I find myself, and it scared me away<BR>
&gt; from the beans.  More specifically, has anyone out there who has gotten<BR>
&gt; &quot;better&quot; from the diet gone on to eat the beans without any problems?<BR>
&gt; I'd love to eat them again, since they are so cheap compared to other<BR>
&gt; &quot;legal&quot; foodstuffs like almond flour, but I'm scared it might make me<BR>
&gt; sick again...<BR>
<BR>
Dear Matthew,<BR>
I tried the beans after having been on the diet for a few months, and did<BR>
great. Sometimes I'd make the recipe in the book, or I'd cook the beans<BR>
until tender in nothing but water and salt. The plain ones I liked  served<BR>
with cheddar cheese and fresh salsa on top. After several months of success<BR>
with the beans, all of a sudden I started noticing the bloating problem, so<BR>
I decided to quit eating them for a while. I tried again 2 or 3 more times<BR>
with a break in between, without success. It would take about 2 weeks for<BR>
the bloating to subside. About a year ago I decided to give the lentils a<BR>
try. Surprisingly, I have absolutely no problem with them. I've been buying<BR>
red lentils, because it looks like they don't have a skin. You can make<BR>
great soups with lentils, and they are also inexpensive. I've been thinking<BR>
of trying the beans again soon, but I'm waiting for a time when I don't<BR>
have much going on in case I have to go through the 2 weeks...  My plan is<BR>
to eat a small amount the first day, and if I do OK, then eat a little more<BR>
the next, but not overdo it.  <BR>
I would also be interested in hearing about other people's experience with<BR>
the beans.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
After more than 8 months of serious SCD, I have come to the conclusion <BR>
that this diet does not help my colon CD at all.<BR>
<BR>
Now comes the obvious question: What to try next? <BR>
<BR>
I still belive (or hope) that some diet can (to some extent) help with <BR>
this disease, but what diet? <BR>
<BR>
Where do people go after SCD fails on them?<BR>

&gt;Dear Ellen,<BR>
<BR>
I have both and since being on the diet, have not used my blender once!  In<BR>
making the cheesecake, it's a breeze with the food processor; likewise,<BR>
cookies, soups pureed, etc.  Couldn't be without it now.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I ground the nuts in it, and while they were more finely ground than<BR>
with a blender, they still don't come close to being the finely ground<BR>
flour like consistency as Hughson Nut Company gets their almond flour.<BR>
<BR>
So, some things just don't work well in food processors...nuts are one of them.<BR>

I recently made the pizza recipe in the book and it turned out excellent,<BR>
except it was too salty.  I used fresh zucchini and grated it using my food<BR>
processor attachment for grating (done in nothing flat) and Hughson's nut<BR>
flour.  The tomato sauce was excellent, but I would not put much salt in it<BR>
(you can always add that later.)  I took this to a party where others were<BR>
eating lasagna and everyone wanted my pizza, after tasting; but I kept it<BR>
for myself since I couldn't share their lasagna!<BR>
<BR>
I furnished the dessert...those fabulous cookies (pecan, cocanut, raisin)<BR>
and two women said they were the best they had ever tasted and wanted the<BR>
recipe!<BR>
<BR>
My SCD food was a real hit!<BR>

Dear Lucy,<BR>
<BR>
Bloating is one of the problems I have...and I haven't tried beans or<BR>
lentils in quite awhile; however, in the past, they have been very very<BR>
difficult for me to tolerate, giving me incredible bloating, gas and<BR>
diarrhea.  I tried the orange lentils and the green; pinto beans, white<BR>
great northern; kidney, and black beans.<BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;Hi,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;After more than 8 months of serious SCD, I have come to the conclusion<BR>
&gt;that this diet does not help my colon CD at all.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Now comes the obvious question: What to try next?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I still belive (or hope) that some diet can (to some extent) help with<BR>
&gt;this disease, but what diet?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Where do people go after SCD fails on them?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;- Kurt<BR>
&gt;<BR>

Dear Kurt,<BR>
<BR>
I have a friend with CD which is now in remission about a year; he went to<BR>
an accupuncturist and took Mannatech products only and is eating everything<BR>
he wants to now except lemon juice!  Mannatech's Manapol.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to  you with whatever you decide on.<BR>

In a message dated 97-09-13 12:05:39 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Also, I ground the nuts in it, and while they were more finely ground than<BR>
 with a blender, they still don't come close to being the finely ground<BR>
 flour like consistency as Hughson Nut Company gets their almond flour.<BR>
 <BR>
 So, some things just don't work well in food processors...nuts are one of<BR>
them. &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I ground my own nuts today for the first time (I'm waiting for my order from<BR>
Hughson's to arrive).  I used a brand new coffee grinder that I hadn't yet<BR>
used for coffee beans.  That worked well.  It's still not as fine as Hughsons<BR>
though.  The muffins I made with the home ground flour have a coarser but not<BR>
unpleasing texture.  Like making something with whole wheat instead of white<BR>
flour.  There's more of a nutty texture and flavor too--someone would think<BR>
you added some ground nuts to the recipe.  (Personnally, I don't actually<BR>
like nuts very much so I prefer the Houghson's flour.  When I bake with that<BR>
you really can't tell there are any nuts in it.  I've fed muffins made with<BR>
the Hughson's flour to a friend who really detests nuts and even he liked<BR>
them!)<BR>

i agree with Kay, try &quot;Enter The Zone&quot; and if you actually go on the diet<BR>
buy &quot;Mastering The Zone&quot; because Sears left out some really important details in<BR>
&quot;Enter The Zone, like getting constipated and needing to take fish oil, or<BR>
needing potasium supplementation since the diet has a strong diurectic effect<BR>
and will deplete you of electrolytes. also there are two good internet sites,<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.enterthezone.com">http://www.enterthezone.com</A> (find out about the diet some here too)<BR>
and <A HREF="http://www.zonehome.com">http://www.zonehome.com</A>. if you really get into the zone diet<BR>
beware of protein powder, some are actually lableled wrong, i<BR>
bought the stuff in the bin at whole foods, 2 tbs = 28g (25g protein) ,<BR>
but when i recently bought an accurate scale i couldn't get two heaping<BR>
tablespoons to weigh more than 20 g.<BR>
<BR>
the zone is the SCD with restrictions on quantities, to avoid an insulin<BR>
spike, which Sears believes is the root of all evil. you get these spikes from<BR>
the carbohydrates you gave up on the SCD diet (honey and carrots are given up<BR>
on the Zone though for the insulin spike problem) and if you eat more than about<BR>
5 ounces of protein at any one meal or snack, fat has no effect on insulin.<BR>
<BR>
there is a similar diet in &quot;Protein Power&quot;, but i bought the book to read not<BR>
to follow, it is a better single book than &quot;Enter The Zone&quot; but 3 of 4 people<BR>
who went on its diet bailed out after starving themselves on only 35g of <BR>
carb per day, while 4 of 4 people who went on the zone are still on it<BR>
a year later.<BR>
<BR>
dont do the zone if you need to gain weight, you will lose all<BR>
your fat though and while losing it you may need to add fish oil or slow the<BR>
rate of loss by adding additional carbohydrates, as several problems<BR>
 could occur do to a sensitivity to arrachidonic acid (AA). this is caused, <BR>
 by the fat cells releasing stored arachidonic acid (AA) (this happened to<BR>
me and i am very sensitive to it.)  the fish oil competes with the AA for the<BR>
delta six destaturase enzyme and thus reduces the conversion of AA to <BR>
Prostaglandin type 2 eicosanoids. the latest research  is finding<BR>
that fish oil helps those suffering from crohns stay in remission.  <BR>
<BR>
the makers of asacol believe that PGE2 (a type two eicosanoid) and <BR>
LTB4 (a leukotrine eicosanoid) are the main culprits in bowel diseases<BR>
and they targeted asacol to mediate their excessive production in the colon. <BR>
you can find this information on the drug insert.<BR>
<BR>
good luck, please keep us posted.<BR>

Dear Kurt,<BR>
I've no idea what to suggest that you try next. For me the SCD was the ONLY<BR>
thing that did give me releif from IBD symptoms. Please do not take this<BR>
question as a challange of any sort or a questioning of your attempt at the<BR>
diet. Have you been doing the SCD 100%? In the past when someone has said<BR>
that the diet didn't work for them, I've asked this question and in many<BR>
cases the person trying the diet had made modifications because they<BR>
thought that the diet could be taken piecemeal, or they didn't care for<BR>
yogurt. In my experience, especially at the beggining, the diet has to be<BR>
worked in it's entirety. It's true that even though the diet has an<BR>
unusually high success rate, even when done exactly as written, it doesn't<BR>
work for everyone. I'd prefer to think that perhaps you've left something<BR>
out (something that can be easily rectified), than to think that the diet<BR>
simply doesn't work for you. In any case, I wish you lots of luck in your<BR>
quest and hope that you find good health very soon.<BR>

Dear all,<BR>
As I've mentioned before, I still experience bloating when eating too much<BR>
in any one sitting. Its as though my damaged gut can only digest a small<BR>
amount of food at one time. Out of all our allowable foods, I do find beans<BR>
the most difficult to digest and can only eat a small amount at a time with<BR>
feeling the bloat. I can even eat every 2 to 3 hours as long as I don't<BR>
overdo.<BR>

You might consider eliminating the dairy from the diet.  It is possible that<BR>
you are sensitive to milk rather than just sensitive to lactose.  If you<BR>
haven't already tried this, it might be an easy change to try and see if that<BR>
helps.  This change moves you closer to the paleothetic diet (one book about<BR>
that is &quot;Neanderthin&quot;).  One of the points they make is that man is poorly<BR>
adapted to digesting grains and milk since they have only done so for the<BR>
last 10,000 years.  Man is also the only animal who (a) drinks milk as an<BR>
adult and (b) drinks the milk of another animal.  After all, cows milk was<BR>
originally intended for other cows!  ;-)   <BR>
<BR>
I would not consider jumping back to a conventional diet just because this<BR>
particular approach isn't solving your problem.  The foods it eliminates may<BR>
still be part of the equation.  Moreover, I've read that eating gluten after<BR>
being gluten free for a long time can make you rather ill (I believe it is<BR>
because you stop producing the enzymes necessary to digest it when you stop<BR>
eating it for a long time)  I'm no expert, so I would suggest checking with<BR>
one if you are considering a return to gluten.<BR>
<BR>
If you eliminate the dairy, the last step toward the paleothetic diet is to<BR>
eliminate beans--including green beans.  (I'm just including this for<BR>
completeness)<BR>
<BR>
I've also heard of those who have had success by eliminating vegetables of<BR>
the nightshade family.  I believe this includes eggplant and kale but I don't<BR>
know enough about it to list them for you here.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure about the idea of going to &quot;The Zone&quot; diet especially if you are<BR>
of normal or sub-normal weight.  My understanding is that the diet is<BR>
designed for weight loss and I'm not sure that limiting your portions is<BR>
necessary or sensible.  (Just my opinion).<BR>
<BR>
I hope you find something that helps you.<BR>
