Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
A while back somebody asked about the Haas book on Management of Celiac<BR>
Disease.  This is the book written by the doctors Elaine consulted to heal<BR>
her daughter.  I have the book out on inter-library loan for two more days<BR>
and might be able to answer questions about it if anybody has any.<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes, Roberta<BR>

I was wondering if it's OK to use 100% Lactose Free Milk.  I saw some in the<BR>
dairy section and thought about asking the manager if they could bring in 100%<BR>
Lactose Free yougurt as well.<BR>

<BR>
I've been on Prednisone for about seven years.  My dosages have<BR>
been mostly towards the lower dosage end between 5&amp;10 mgs. having<BR>
been as high as 30 mgs.  The main side effect that I know of is<BR>
decreased bone density.  Two years ago my primary care physician<BR>
put me  a drug called Phosamax which builds bone density and my<BR>
that has made a big difference my densities are back to normal.<BR>
I hope this helps.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks Gene<BR>

Dear SCD list,<BR>
<BR>
I have been doing well, making remarkable progress on SCD for the past<BR>
70 days or so.  Suddenly, without changing anything that I can pinpoint<BR>
as a cause some of my symptoms that had abated considerably has returned<BR>
causing me much discomfort.  Nausea is my number one complaint.  For<BR>
some reason this has been bothering me very badly for the past two days<BR>
and nothing seems to help it that has helped in the past.<BR>
<BR>
I has occured to me that Elaine says that often at 2-3 months their is<BR>
an unexplained relapse but she implies that usually it has to do with a<BR>
respirtory infection.  Have many of you experienced this kind of thing<BR>
at 2-3 months?  How long did it last?  HELP!<BR>

Pat,<BR>
The same thing has happened to me.  Except I've experienced mine at about 5<BR>
months.  My main symptom is diarhea and my doctor is very frustrated.  The<BR>
medication is not even working.  My relapse started in November and still<BR>
hasn't stopped.  I don't know what's causing it and would also like some<BR>
HELP if anyone has any.<BR>

Hi...I too have been on Prednisone on and off for years.    I'm seeing a bone<BR>
specialist this month.  I'm going for a bone density test as well.  Can you<BR>
tell me whats involved with a bone density test?  Do they have to shoot stuff<BR>
into your veins?  Also,  could you tell me what the  side effects are, if any,<BR>
to Phosamax.  Do you know what it contains?  How long did you  it take for<BR>
your bones to rebuild to normal?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Colleen<BR>

I've been on Prednisone for about seven years.  My dosages have<BR>
been mostly towards the lower dosage end between 5&amp;10 mgs. having<BR>
been as high as 30 mgs.  The main side effect that I know of is<BR>
decreased bone density.  Two years ago my primary care physician<BR>
put me  a drug called Phosamax which builds bone density and my<BR>
that has made a big difference my densities are back to normal.<BR>
I hope this helps.<BR>

I had the relapse that Elaine describes in the book.  I couldn't see any<BR>
reason for it, and I didn't have any kind of cold.  It started just before<BR>
two months on the diet, and it lasted almost two weeks, although I could at<BR>
least see my condition improving after a week.<BR>

Take care,<BR>

Hi All,<BR>
<BR>
I don't know if this will help or not, but after about 2 months on the diet,<BR>
I had a relapse that put me in the diarreah mode. It took awhile to find out<BR>
what was causing it, but eventually I did find out, by accident. For me it<BR>
was the nut flour. Altough I did okay with the nut flour for the first two<BR>
months, for some reason I developed an intolerance to it. I didn't eat nut<BR>
flour for about three days and all of the sudden the diarreah was gone. I've<BR>
stayed away from the nut flour for over two months and have had no problems<BR>
what-so-ever.<BR>
<BR>
That's my input; what worked for me may not work for you, but one never<BR>
knows. All I do know is that we have tricky guts with individualized<BR>
disfunctions that we must experiment with. I hope my input helps.<BR>
<BR>

	Pat, Annie, and other sufferers,<BR>
<BR>
	I too had a relapse at 3 months, but I could name the culprit: bad apple<BR>
cider.  It took me three months and much prednizone to get out of trouble.<BR>
Now, a year latter, almost to the day, I am again having trouble, but with<BR>
two main differences: it is not nearly as bad, and the cause may be an<BR>
infection.<BR>
<BR>
	From these experiences I draw, for myself at least, two conclusions:<BR>
<BR>
1. Stick with the diet through thick and thin.  One would be in worse shape<BR>
without the diet than with it.<BR>
<BR>
2. If relapses come, perhaps  (let us hope), each time they come they are<BR>
less severe than before.  Again: stick with the diet.<BR>
<BR>
3.  In times of stress, as Elaine and others have urged, draw back on the<BR>
diet to the simplest beginning form (chicken soup, etc.).<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,<BR>

Pat, Annie and other sufferers,<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the SCD diet for 4/5 months and my experience agrees very<BR>
much with that of Ann Watts.<BR>
<BR>
I  have to watch my diet very carefully in order to avoid bad actors that<BR>
seem to sneak in there once in a while.<BR>
When there is a relapse I go back to the most radical form of the diet until<BR>
I get back to where I was before.<BR>
The diet works in time not pronto...<BR>
<BR>
But one thing is for sure, I  have to be vigilant, constantly vigilant about<BR>
bad actors that sneak in to my diet and put me back.<BR>
When I am free of symptoms for a while, I tend to get over-confident and<BR>
start trying foods which might be a little questionable. Every time I did<BR>
this I got into trouble. So now I think I have learned.<BR>
<BR>
No more uncooked fresh veggies, no apple juice or any other compound product<BR>
that comes out of a can or a bottle. I just stick to fish, meat, chicken....<BR>
grilled or steamed.... allowed veggies steamed or broiled to a point that<BR>
they are soft. No fibrous veggies.  Eggs in the morning with blueberry<BR>
muffins, honey and tea.<BR>
<BR>
Almond flour from Hodgeson in California.. makes good muffins and bread....<BR>
I have never had a problem with any of the<BR>
things I made from this almond flour. The blueberry muffins I make are<BR>
always a good standby snack. Bananas in the muffin or<BR>
the bread mix seem to work wonders. I use yogurt exclusively instead of dry<BR>
curd cottage cheese.<BR>
<BR>
Whenever I feel some symptoms I go back to the core diet. And eventually<BR>
things to straighten out.<BR>
<BR>
The more I stay on the diet, the more I become a convinced disciple of<BR>
Elaine Gottschall. I am beginning to think she is a<BR>
Saint. Our Saint..<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck to all sufferers.<BR>
Keep the faith....<BR>

&gt; Pat, Annie, and other sufferers,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I too had a relapse at 3 months, but I could name the culprit: bad apple<BR>
&gt;cider.  It took me three months and much prednizone to get out of trouble.<BR>
&gt;Now, a year latter, almost to the day, I am again having trouble, but with<BR>
&gt;two main differences: it is not nearly as bad, and the cause may be an<BR>
&gt;infection.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; From these experiences I draw, for myself at least, two conclusions:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1. Stick with the diet through thick and thin.  One would be in worse shape<BR>
&gt;without the diet than with it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2. If relapses come, perhaps  (let us hope), each time they come they are<BR>
&gt;less severe than before.  Again: stick with the diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;3.  In times of stress, as Elaine and others have urged, draw back on the<BR>
&gt;diet to the simplest beginning form (chicken soup, etc.).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Good luck,<BR>

Annie and Pat,<BR>
Sorry to say, but I have to join this 2-3 month not doing well club.  In the<BR>
beginning I ate the nut flour and small amounts of the allowable cheeses<BR>
without any problem.  Then when this system went down around thanksgiving, and<BR>
before I realized what was wrong, I wrote a &quot;help I'm not doing well message.&quot;<BR>
Worse diarhea - so I started eliminating things and my system calmed down. Now<BR>
I can eat no nut flour or dairy and must severly limit bananas and watered<BR>
down grape juice.  This limits the scd diet to the point where I don't even<BR>
feel I'm really following it because all I eat is meat, vegetables, and cooked<BR>
fruit.  I don't cheat.  I read an old post (on the other list) from a Dan<BR>
Woods who mentioned he could not eat nut flour or dairy and I was wondering<BR>
how he or others like him, were doing now.  I'm sure we would all be happy<BR>
campers if we could just eat all the food in the scd diet, never cheat of<BR>
course, and do well.  I would like to know how long that takes and if some<BR>
people never tolerate certain foods as widespread as all dairy and nuts.  Have<BR>
you limited your food Annie or Pat?  Pat, I'm real sorry to hear about the<BR>
nausea.  Jane<BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I just finished reading the book by the Haas Doctors who originated the diet<BR>
that cured Elaine's daughter and that became the basis for Elaine's book.<BR>
Those doctors often observed relapses in their patients-- often associated<BR>
with an illness (of various sorts).  If the illness was likely to cause<BR>
abdominal distress in the normal population it was likely to be the culprit<BR>
in the return of diarrhea to the doctors' patient. The doctors Haas<BR>
suggested that the diet be examined carefully to make sure that no forbidden<BR>
foods had been added. In most cases the diarrhea seemed to stop in a few<BR>
weeks.  (I personally think that stress can bring on a relapse.  Does that<BR>
ring a bell for anyone?)<BR>
<BR>
The book implied that the longer a child stayed on the diet, the less likely<BR>
the child was to have relapses. I think it was about 18 months that relapses<BR>
stopped.<BR>
By the way, their patients were children and the ones reported on had celiac<BR>
disease not IBD, but the diet seems to work much the same way for us (IBDers).<BR>
<BR>
Somebody asked why a food that seems ok in the beginning suddenly becomes a<BR>
problem.  I recall someone saying months ago that as the bowel heals it<BR>
actually becomes more sensitive to offending foods.  I know it happened like<BR>
that for me.  I ate yoghurt in the very beginning, but as my symptoms<BR>
improved I became less able to eat yoghurt and finally had to give it up.<BR>
<BR>
I agree with the others that say stay on the diet and use the basic diet<BR>
when relapses occur.  <BR>
<BR>
Best wishes,<BR>
Roberta<BR>

Before I went on the diet, I was on mesalamine for three years solid. I<BR>
couldn't bare life without it. After three months on the diet I finally got<BR>
off of the mesalamine. I only use it occassionally if I have bleeding from<BR>
occassional bouts of constipation. In the last two months I've used<BR>
mesalamine for only two days. My CD never got bad enough for me to be put on<BR>
prednisone.<BR>

Hi Jane (and others),<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I read an old post (on the other list) from a Dan Woods who mentioned<BR>
&gt; he could not eat nut flour or dairy and I was wondering how he or others<BR>
&gt; like him, were doing now.<BR>
<BR>
I don't recall ever saying that I had a specific problem with the nut<BR>
flour or dairy.  I believe I said that I avoided starting to use nut<BR>
flour until after 2 months on the diet.  And nut flour is still ok<BR>
for me now (six months on diet).<BR>
<BR>
As far as dairy... I believe I said that I noticed cheese caused me some<BR>
problems in the beginning.  However I was able to-reintroduce them<BR>
successfully (no bad reaction) later after about 3 months into the diet.<BR>
This was also true for eggs.  I did use them in the cheesecake recipe<BR>
since the beginning and this seemd ok.  I eat 2 soft-boiled eggs every<BR>
morning.  Yogurt was never a problem for me.<BR>
<BR>
As I have said often on the list, my personal experience indicates that<BR>
it is *extremely* important to only introduce ONE new food at a time<BR>
for at least 2-3 days.  If you have no bad reactions (ie: D., pain),<BR>
then you will know for sure that you can include it in your *personal* list<BR>
of acceptable foods.<BR>
<BR>
I have made this mistake recently (getting ready for X-Mas) by trying to<BR>
introduce Chinese Mandarin oranges and green salad (with cucumber, tomato,<BR>
and mustard/honey sauce).  I know all the stuff I added to salad are ok for<BR>
me, but I think the romaine lettuce caused problems.  I know this because<BR>
I had already stopped the oranges first.  It has taken at least 2 days for<BR>
the salad to clear my system and get back to &quot;normal&quot;.  I will wait two<BR>
more (good) days, and then try oranges again (by itself).  This is the<BR>
type of process I go through, and it works well (with lots of discipline).<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps :)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

When I was beginning this diet months ago I asked if okra was okay and<BR>
the answer I received was that it was okay and probably good for you to<BR>
eat.  I use it without any problem.  It helps to thicken gumbo. I want to<BR>
thank Joan for her soft bread receipe.  I made a loaf and used it to make<BR>
bread dressing at thanksgiving.  It was great also I thank it tastes good<BR>
by itself.  I know it doesn't taste like real bread but since I have been<BR>
on this diet for almost 8 months I don't really know what real bread<BR>
tastes like.  Today I took the softbread receipe and converted to<BR>
cinnamon raisin bread.  It was great so I thought I would share the<BR>
receipe.<BR>
<BR>
Soft Cinnamon Raisin Bread<BR>
3 1/2 cup almond flour<BR>
3 eggs<BR>
1/4 cup melted butter<BR>
1 tsp baking soda<BR>
1 cup yogurt (homemade)<BR>
1/4 tsp salt<BR>
3/4 cup honey<BR>
2 tbl cinnamon<BR>
1/2 - 3/4 cup raisins<BR>
<BR>
Directions:  Mix together in food processor, adding raisins at the very<BR>
end.  Put in buttered loaf pan and then bake at 350 degrees for 45<BR>
minutes.  Let it cool completely before removing from pan.<BR>

I love all the testimonials on heartburn. I found out tonight the exact<BR>

+AD4-NIGHT WAKINGS: We were wondering if anybody has any thoughts on what the<BR>
+AD4-possible cause/reasons might be for +ACI-night wakings+ACI- It will be almost two<BR>
+AD4-years that Martine has been on the SCD - STRICTLY. (She has never cheated)<BR>
+AD4-She is basically is eating chicken, fish, cheese, yougurt, nutbread and<BR>
+AD4-butter along with cooked carrots and squash along with apple sauce.  Yet<BR>
she<BR>
+AD4-still finds that her nights are when her bowels are more active, resulting<BR>
+AD4-in shorter periods of sleep.  Any thoughts, similar experiences or<BR>
+AD4-suggestions would be appreciated.<BR>
Snip+AD4-<BR>
Allan<BR>
<BR>
Is Martine drinking any amount of liquids prior to bed time, or in the<BR>
evenings?<BR>
<BR>
I ask this question because a warm cup of coffee, or for that matter even a<BR>
warm cup of water will keep me regular in the mornings approx 8:30  to 9:30<BR>
each day . Given that I eat at least two reasonable sized meals a day.<BR>
<BR>
hope this might be helpfull.<BR>

Hi.<BR>
<BR>
I guess it's the same with UC as with CD which I have. It can give you<BR>
fever in case of a flare, that's why your doc asked about it. I've had<BR>
it for a few times in my pre-SCD days. Now I'm getting it every other<BR>
day without a flare (OK, I haven't been feeling too well for the last<BR>
couple of weeks, but is the fever a result of that or is it the other<BR>
way around???), not as high as it could be before SCD though, but still<BR>
a bit annoying since it occurs almost every day. The readings before SCD<BR>
could be up to 104, now it's more like 99.5-100.5.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all.<BR>

Hi Jane,<BR>
<BR>
Forgive the delay in response, I am just getting caught up on all<BR>
the SCD messsages this week.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Has anyone out there cured their heartburn along with IBD symptoms?<BR>
<BR>
Yes, since day *one* on the diet, I have not had any heartburn (unless<BR>
I overeat).  I used to take Pepcid-AC every night after supper... no more.<BR>
Bloating and gas, if any, is minor.<BR>

I suffered from acute dizziness for about two months, particularly while lying<BR>
down at night and turning my head. I could never figure out if it was from low<BR>
blood sugar or something with my inner ear. It's gone now and I do try to eat<BR>
more carbs.<BR>

I noticed in &quot;Prescriptions for Natural Healing&quot; peppermint  &quot;increases<BR>
stomach acidity.  Irritates mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal<BR>

rheumatism, convulsions, spasms, and headaches.  Caution:  May interfere<BR>

&gt;Tis the season for Night Wakings I guess.  I have been getting them<BR>
&gt;as well for over one month.  I know it's trapped gas.  How it became<BR>
&gt;trapped and why I don't know.  I just read about the helpful effects<BR>
&gt;of peppermint ( tea or oil )  used to break up gas and soothe the GI<BR>
&gt;tract.  I want to try this. I bought some Slippery Elm Bark last week<BR>
&gt;for alleviation of these night wakings then learned today that the<BR>
&gt;Slippery Elm Bark is mainly a polysaccharide ( to answer another<BR>
&gt;question from last week ).  So the Bark goes to the back of the herb<BR>
&gt;shelf. ;-)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I haven't talked to a professional about how to administer the<BR>
&gt;peppermint to be most effective for overnight relief. Anyone else out<BR>
&gt;there already using Peppermint that could add more?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Someone once queried about being symptomatic at certain times of the<BR>
&gt;year.  I noticed an increase of people stating that symptoms are<BR>
&gt;appearing.  My guess is that the visions of sugarplums that dance in<BR>
&gt;our heads contain disaccharides.  I am completely<BR>
&gt;joking.....symptomatic, but in a very festive mood.  :-)<BR>

Dear Jane,<BR>
<BR>
I have been &quot;plagued&quot; with vertigo in the last year;and off and on, in the<BR>
last 15 years or so.  Doctors diagnose its source the inner ear which gets<BR>
infected from fluids that drain from my sinuses (allergies).  I have not<BR>
had such marked symptoms immediately after eating a particular meal as you<BR>
have, but rather, especially, when lying down, turning over in bed, or<BR>
while rising from having lay down and walking first minute or so after<BR>
rising.<BR>
<BR>
I find nasal sprays prescribed by my internist (Beconnase) help me to<BR>
normalize; then I don't spray until it starts again...I find the spray<BR>
irritates the lining of my nose if prolonged use.<BR>
<BR>
Question:  Do you have allergies?  If so, you could be very allergic to<BR>
something you are eating that could cause the dizziness.  Why not check one<BR>
of the foods at a time for several days and leave off the others to see?<BR>
<BR>
We have to be our own detectives!!!!!  I am finding after 6 months on the<BR>
SCD diet, that I am become more sensitive to my &quot;food offenders&quot; and less<BR>
tolerant of them than ever before!!!  Perhaps this is the case for you,<BR>
too.  I wonder.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to you in &quot;sussing&quot; it out.  And a healthier and happy new year<BR>
as well to you and all of us!<BR>

it surprises me that you would have such a dilemma on the scd. it must be lack<BR>
of carbs or dehydration. while i myself never experience dizziness ( good<BR>
thing because i am a high rise window cleaner) ,but my sister did and fixed it<BR>
by staying away from grains ( she's not on the scd nor has any ibd but<BR>
allegies to wheat and yeast) . try drinking lots of juice with water and get<BR>
some good vitamins w/ b like in the book. i far from expert but its my input.<BR>

Hi Everyone!  Hope everyone is doing well.  As for me I am going to be on<BR>
this wonderful diet for 1 year come 12/24/97.  Last year at this time I was<BR>
on my death bed.  I weighed 125lb and my normal weight prior to my Crohns<BR>
was 186-192lb. and my height is 5'11&quot;.  Now I am very happy to say I have<BR>
no bleeding, joint pain and stomach pain at all, thank GOD!  I am also not<BR>
running to the nearest toilet any more.  I am sorry that I haven't been<BR>
writing in as often, I have been so busy.  I am a Contractor and it is my<BR>
own company.  I am also doing alot of work for Dr. Ronald Hoffman.  If<BR>
nobody knows who he is, he wrote the forward to Elaine's book.  I heard<BR>
that Elaine wants to write another book with Dr. Hoffman and this time she<BR>
wants him to participate in the hole book rather than just forward.  That I<BR>
think would be one hell of a book.  I think that if anyone live close<BR>
enough to Manhattan they should definitely have Dr. Hoffman as there<BR>
doctor.  He really cares about his patients and is very knowledgeable in<BR>
his field.  <BR>
<BR>
Enough yapping on my part, hope I didn't bore anyone.<BR>

Happy Holidays!    <BR>

In 1985 I went to my Dr. cause I wase having this (Vertigo).  While I <BR>
was there I mentioned these stomach pains but I felt it was secondary <BR>
to the Vertigo which really scared me.  Turns out the vertigo is no <BR>

<BR>
Hello Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Want to share what I did that worked with regard to eating out.  I called<BR>
ahead to the restaurant of choice and they suggested I talk to the chef and<BR>
explain my special diet needs, which I did.  The chef asked that I put all<BR>
the info on a card and give it to the waitress/waiter and ask that person<BR>
to give it to the chef.<BR>
<BR>
I did that and it worked so beautifully and smoothly.  I relaxed, and<BR>
talked with my friend and out came our dinners...smooth as silk and no big<BR>
deal of having to have the waiter run back and forth with questions, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Everyone appreciated the way my special diet needs were handled and I plan<BR>
to continue to do this.  I have put it on my computer and will get a few<BR>
sheets of cardstock stationery and print it on there; cut to size, and slip<BR>
into my handbag for anytime I am eating out!<BR>
<BR>
It looked like this:<BR>

Subject: anyone saves their digested lists????<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;c252aac8.349c542b@aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hello !<BR>
<BR>
I have had the computer down for the past 2 weeks because we transferred our<BR>
telephone line to our new house since we spent all day there renovating it.  I<BR>
was wondering if anyone saves their digested lists and can forward some to me.<BR>
I had posted a question about 100% lactose free milk and whether or not it was<BR>
safe, but the phone line was transferred before I had a chance to see if there<BR>
were any responses.  I am curious to know what I had missed out on all this<BR>
time....<BR>
<BR>
Thanks a lot,<BR>
<BR>

In a message dated 97-12-20 19:53:13 EST, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; I have been on the SCD diet approximately 2 months.<BR>
 For the last 2 weeks I have an aching pain in my arms/elbows<BR>
 and my knees feel quite stiff at times too.<BR>
 -Has anyone else experienced something like this while on<BR>
 the SCD diet and if so for how long?<BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Isabella,<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the SCD diet for almost 3 months.  After seeing improvement the<BR>
first two months (BM and arthritis), I started feeling worse: frequent<BR>
abdominal pains, return of pain and swelling in my feet, arms, wrists, and<BR>
knees, bad BMs...In fact a couple of weeks ago I was in such a bad shape, I<BR>
could barely wobble, and had to massage my feet all day to help with the pain.<BR>
Then I finally broke down and started taking Prednisone for the first time.<BR>
After the 1st pill, the arthritic pain went away and now I have free mobility.<BR>
Too bad the abdominal cramps and BM did not improve.  Then I re-read Elanine's<BR>
book where she wrote that approx. 2-3 months after starting the diet, it's<BR>
common to suffer a relapse, with other minor setbacks throughout the first<BR>
year or so.  I can only assume that what's happening now: a relapse.  Due to<BR>
the internal inflammation, I believe ( and my doctor confirms it all the time)<BR>
it is the culprit in what is causing inflammation and pain in the joints.<BR>
Afterall, isn't IBD an inflammation?  Fortunately, not everyone is afflicted<BR>
with arthrits, but some of are, and it's pretty bad.  I read that omaga-3 fish<BR>
oils do a pretty good job with arthritic pain and inflammaiton: along with<BR>
cats'c claw, glutamine and propbably a few others I can't recall right now. I<BR>
am taking these supplements my self right now, hoping it will take effect<BR>
soon.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
<BR>

i believe the book says lactose digested milk is not allowed because the<BR>
result is lactase (the sweet taste in the digestes lactose ) is a disaccharide<BR>
or something like that.<BR>

<BR>
thats fortunate that you found such an accomadating chef. thats the key word<BR>
chef .in a good restaurant with a discriminating chef with inetgrity this<BR>
could be done but in less quality (cook) it might not be as effective. what i<BR>
have done is research my differant ethnic foods thru cookbooks and see what it<BR>
takes to prepare them and order those when i go out . i find a lot of thai<BR>
food is ok .they generally dont use starch , sometimes sugar but only certain<BR>
dishes but i think i will give your method a try.<BR>

To all my fellow Bowel Buddies, <BR>
<BR>
I've been on this diet since beginning of '95.  Strictly!!!!  I too have had<BR>
relapses.  I have been hosptialized twice since I started this diet with<BR>
severe flare ups of ulcerative colitis.  The diet has helped me, but I've<BR>
continued my search for a 'cure' as I continue eating the SCD, because<BR>
although it's helped it's not cured it.<BR>
<BR>
I've had this disease for 14 years. I've researched health for as long as I've<BR>
been sick.  During my quest for my health I've  shared openly and generously<BR>
with people who have bowel disease anything I come across that is of some help<BR>
to me.   As I have with Elaine's Diet. I've shared it with many , many people.<BR>
I absolutely adore Elaine. Due to my support,  she has spoken many times in my<BR>
hometown . They always went over very well.  I too have done talks regarding<BR>
this diet and bowel disease as well.  <BR>
<BR>
As my health continues to challenge me my search continues.  I thought I had<BR>
turned over every stone as far as diets go.  I thought Elaine's hit it right<BR>
on the head.  It's made so much sense.  But, I continued to suffer with flare<BR>
ups even after three years being on her diet very strictly.   I have had<BR>
allergy tests done and removed those foods from my diet as well.  I have been<BR>
under the care of a naturopath, etc. <BR>
<BR>
Being sick has cost me thousands of dollars, aside from how it's affected my<BR>
quality of life and relationships with friends and family.  I want to healthy<BR>
so bad so I can live a normal, wonderful life like others are who are healthy.<BR>
<BR>
In June of 97, I was hospitalized again after trying to heal at homw for 5<BR>
months and for the life of me could not understand why I couldn't get better.<BR>
Then when I got out of the hospital I could not come down on the prednisone<BR>
without having the extreme symptoms come back.  I started to contemplate<BR>
surgery in Novermber because I was so sick of being sick and the side effects<BR>
of being on such high doses of steroids were just as bad as the disease<BR>
itself.  <BR>
<BR>
Then my prayers were answered...  <BR>
<BR>
I came across someone who had 'cured' themself from this very disease,<BR>
ulceritive colitis,  and has been free of symptoms for over 8 years.  <BR>
<BR>
I checked into it and found others just like him who had 'cured' themselves of<BR>
the disease as well as chron's and other bowel diseases...with no relapses and<BR>
it's been years for them. Even colon cancer!!!   I was crying I was so excited<BR>
to hear this news.  It's been like a message from God for me.  There is light<BR>
at the end of this very dark tunnle after all.  I have been inspired to have<BR>
hope again.  I want to pass this on to you. <BR>
<BR>
I am for the first time since June down to 5 mgs of prednisone and in two<BR>
weeks I plan to be off completely.  Previous to my switch in diet I had not<BR>
been able to reduce my dose of 60 mgs for 6 months.  I feel this new path is<BR>
helping me like never before.  I want to share it with those of you on this<BR>
board, but you'll have to write to me separately as It's too long to put on<BR>
this list. <BR>
<BR>
I totally support people doing Elaine's diet if it's working for them on the<BR>
level they want.  But for those who are continuing  to get relapses or for<BR>
those who want to 'heal and cure' their disease ...I invite you to just check<BR>
this out. <BR>
<BR>
I was going to wait a few months to share this info with you people.  I wanted<BR>
to be off the prednisone and doing REALLY well,  but I am getting better and<BR>
feel so much more vitality then I have in a year AND I'm getting bombarded<BR>
with e-mails from this list that people are suffering still and I feel selfish<BR>
keeping this info to myself.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm exploring as you all are and feel it only supportive of me to share this<BR>
with you.  I have not completely healed yet...but I am no longer feeing like<BR>
I'm going to have to face surgery.  And I have been in touch with those who<BR>
have healed completely and their teaching me how to do it.  That's good enough<BR>
for me to try it and pass on the good news!<BR>
<BR>
My e-mail address is cwhartford@aol.com<BR>
<BR>
I am planning on leaving this list soon as the SCD is no longer my focus at<BR>
this time.  <BR>
<BR>
I wish you all the best.  <BR>
<BR>
In health, Colleen<BR>

I got Symbioflor from my doctor.  That's the e. coli suppliment, right?  His<BR>
name is Dr. W.A. Shrader and he's located in Sante Fe, New Mexico.  I don't<BR>
know if he would sell to someone who is not a patient, but you could check.<BR>
<BR>
Warning, though, I got D. from it.  And that was before I was diagnosed with<BR>
IBD.<BR>

<BR>
I'm trying to get started on the diet.  I got the Yogourmet yogurt maker.<BR>
Normally I can't digest yogurt well because of the lactose, though I have<BR>
done o.k. by treating it with lactase drops.  I also have been using 100%<BR>
lactose free milk on occassion without trouble.  And before I was lactose<BR>
intolerent I ate yogurt all of the time. <BR>
<BR>
I used the Yogourmet starter to make the 24 hour yogurt.  I was able to<BR>
digest it very well.  However, immediately upon eating it I got a migraine<BR>
headache. I am prone to these, but have not gotten one before from milk.<BR>
(Though there are many other foods I do need to avoid.)  Sometimes I have<BR>
had a slight headache from yogurt that's been around too long, you know that<BR>
last 1/2 cup at the bottom of the quart, but never a full blown migraine.  <BR>
<BR>
I am wondering if anybody else has had this problem and what they have done<BR>
about it.  I am wondering if I should try to build up my yogurt intake a<BR>
little at a time?  Would some other type of starter be better?  A different<BR>
type of milk, like goat milk?   <BR>
<BR>
I really want to try this diet, and I really would like to to able to eat<BR>
this yogurt.  I know from Great Smokies stool tests that I do not have any<BR>
Lactobacillus acidophilus in my bowel, even after aggressive supplimentation<BR>
with the acidophilus pills and powders.   So yogurt seems the only way to<BR>
get it back.<BR>
<BR>
Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you.<BR>

From time to time there are some lengthy letters and while it is good to<BR>
reference them, it is not necessary to quote and repeat the entire letter.<BR>
Often there is an entire letter quoted with a simple &quot;thanks&quot; added to the<BR>
end.  This results in us all (if we so desire ) having to print it all out<BR>
again!!!  As a suggestion the general rule of thumb is to first quote the<BR>
document in your subject box &quot;Re:, Reply: or Further:&quot; then simply<BR>
paraphrase a key point you want to discuss such as:<BR>

What lenghty letters are you talking about?<BR>
<BR>
It does not need a complete iteration of the originating document thus<BR>
keeping our file sizes smaller and our printing less.  Thank you all and<BR>
also thank you for your sustanined interest and support of his group.<BR>
Without this we would all feel (those with IBD and those whose leved ones<BR>
have IBD) very much alone.<BR>

Can the yogurt be a coincidence that you had a migraine headache.  I would<BR>
try the diet without the yogurt for a couple of weeks and then try the<BR>
yogurt.  Hopefully it was a coincidence.<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>
<BR>
Happy Holidays<BR>
