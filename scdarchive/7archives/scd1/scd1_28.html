Dear Prateeksha<BR>
I don't know anything about the double decker system. I'd bought a Salton<BR>
yogurt maker when I first started the diet and sold it at my last garage<BR>
sale because I wasn't crazy about the yogurt it produced. I use a light<BR>
bulb in my oven with a pen to prop the door open to let out excess heat. I<BR>
boil the 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (3 quarts) in my farberware pot and after I've added the<BR>
starter I just stick the same pot, covered, in my oven. Makes great yogurt.<BR>
Yes, I'm basically true to the diet, but in the last couple of months I've<BR>
cheated just a little ( a spoon of this, a taste of that).It hasn't made me<BR>
ill but I think that the diet is so ingrained in me that I'm terrified that<BR>
it might. I still haven't touched most of the biggies (pasta, potatoes,<BR>
rice) and frankly the diet has enough in it to keep me satisfied. I've<BR>
heard from other people who'd been on the diet successfully for a couple of<BR>
years, gone off and become ill. In fact as I'm writing this, I'm thinking<BR>
I'm gonna stay away from temptations before I get into trouble. Thanks for<BR>
making me look at the situation.<BR>

&gt; &gt; The one area I've strayed intentionally is that the diet allows only<BR>
&gt; &quot;weak&quot;<BR>
&gt; &gt; coffee.  I still make my normal coffee in the morning and drink 2 or 3<BR>
&gt; cups<BR>
&gt; &gt; of it.  This ritual has always been important for motivating my bowels in<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt; morning and therefore having my body be comfortable during the day.<BR>
&gt; Cutting<BR>
&gt; &gt; that out along with everything else seemed like too drastic a change for<BR>
&gt; my<BR>
&gt; &gt; system, and unnecessary since I don't have diareaha.  I don't drink<BR>
&gt; coffee<BR>
&gt; &gt; any other time of the day though.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; Dear Ellen,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I doubt that Elaine requires that the coffee be very weak just to give us<BR>
&gt; coffee lovers a bad time. My concern with drinking regular strength coffee<BR>
&gt; is that besides propelling the contents of the colon forward, it most<BR>
&gt; likely moves the contents of<BR>
&gt; your small intestine forward also. If the enzymes in the small intestine<BR>
&gt; haven't finished doing their job, then undigested food could be feeding the<BR>
&gt; bacteria and yeast in the colon.<BR>
&gt; There are probably other reasons for restricting strong coffee intake. I'm<BR>
&gt; guessing it might irritate the lining of the intestine.<BR>
&gt; Hopefully, getting off of a high starch diet will correct your morning<BR>
&gt; slugishness, and you won't be &quot;needing&quot; the coffee.<BR>
&gt; With the addictive quality of caffeine I know it's hard it is to kick the<BR>
&gt; habit, but it is necessary, to truly be on the diet. I find I'm better off<BR>
&gt; just staying away from it, because it seems like as with most addictive<BR>
&gt; substances, a little eventually leads to more (weak to stronger). At least<BR>
&gt; that was my experience.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.<BR>
&gt; Lucy<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; PS. Of course if you can manage to stick to truly very weak coffee, there<BR>
&gt; should be no problem. The way I deal with it is to have it on rare<BR>
&gt; occasions, rather than make it a daily routine. That way the strength has<BR>
&gt; less of a chance of sneaking up on me.<BR>
I have found that coffee, even weak, still gives me trouble, and I've been on the <BR>
diet over 1 1/2 years!  I can't seem to stay away from it, since it stimulates my <BR>
mind out of the fog it often finds itself.  I wish there were an alternative.  More <BR>
sleep, I know. But that is a bit of a stretch at the moment, as I prepare for grad. <BR>
school, coach soccer, and work full time with a second job!  I think I should just <BR>
accept it.  Coffee dosen't work on the diet for me.<BR>

Ellen,<BR>

Great to hear you are one-weak-and-going-strong on the diet.  I've found<BR>
that once you get used to it, there is really quite a lot to eat and<BR>
quite a variety, at that.  Regarding your question about changes in<BR>
bowel symptoms, I too found that mine changed a lot over the course of<BR>
being on the diet.  I went from diarrhea or loose, frequent stool for<BR>
six or more years (I've lost count) to, within the first couple months<BR>
on the diet I became constipated and had to use psyllium (1/4 tsp. twice<BR>
a day in a glass of water).  That also helped with a sticky stool<BR>
problem I have had off and on.  After six months on the SCD though, my<BR>
stool is quite &quot;normal,&quot; although it tends to fall apart in the toilet. <BR>
Sorry for the graphic details, this stuff never would have interested me<BR>
in my pre-health problem days. What I understand is that as our guts<BR>
heal, they go through various changes in absorbing water from the stool,<BR>
sometimes too much, sometimes not enough.  This seems to resolve itself<BR>
over time.  I wonder what other's could add to this with personal<BR>
experience stories and would be glad to hear them. <BR>
<BR>
I am curious, if you have never had trouble with diarrhea, how did your<BR>
doctor think to check you for Crohns?  I had diarrhea for six years and<BR>
I never got a doctor to take my condition seriously.  Even when I did<BR>
find a doctor who took me seriously, they never considered my condition<BR>
serious enough to warrant a colonoscopy or anything.  So, I'm curious<BR>
how you got your diagnosis.  My mom has Crohns and she didn't have<BR>
diarrhea either, but she did, at some point, have blood in her stool,<BR>
which alerted her physician.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck with the diet.<BR>

How are all you guy's?  Me I am still very healthy on this wonderful diet,<BR>
but I noticed in the past few weeks I have been getting really depressed. <BR>
I don't know why?  Maybe it has alot to do with my business or maybe<BR>
because I am not on good terms with part of my family?  I am wondering if<BR>
it is because I am malnourished in some sort of way?  I am taking vitamins,<BR>
multiples, antioxidants and even Ginkgo.  I am wondering do you guy's get<BR>
these really bad depressed moods? <BR>

Dear Jim,<BR>
I think it would be virtually impossible to have a chronic illness and not<BR>
become occasionally overcome &amp; depressed. I've found that my depression<BR>
does not always strike when things are going badly,but rather when they<BR>
have calmed down. Life with it's normal fluxes of highs and lows (and<BR>
family squabbles) is hard enough to deal with, but the addition of a<BR>
diseased colon running your life, even when it's healthy but you have the<BR>
additional stress of keeping it that way, can sometimes be just too much to<BR>
bear. In my experience, having a stressfull job, a couple of hardheaded<BR>
adult children, juggling relationships, even doing the stuff you love, is<BR>
all hard work and there are days I'd much rather pull the cover up over my<BR>
head and escape into myself, but I don't let that black cloud of depression<BR>
win. I get up, force myself to excersize, to work and to deal with the<BR>
challenges called life. You happened to catch me at a time when I'm having<BR>
a problem with a co-worker, my daughter is talking about moving to the<BR>
other side of the USA, my arthritis hurts, and I'm going through menopause.<BR>
Writing my thoughts out to you has helped. I'm going to finish getting<BR>
dressed, go take my karate class, go to work, come home to my loving, and<BR>
oh so patient husband, and pray for a good nights sleep. Tomorrow's another<BR>
day, new battles to win, and gratitudes to recognize.<BR>

I have had the same experience.  Once, I added the yogurt (I don't use<BR>

curdled and the result was not as good-tasting or creamy.  Now I add the<BR>
yogurt to cool milk.  It does take longer for the mixture to get back to<BR>

Thanks for your insights and I think you make some interesting points.  I<BR>
hadn't thought of the details of how it might affect the intestines.  I will<BR>
probably give it up at some point--especially if I can wake up feeling good!<BR>
 Right now, it's the only way I can get myself to work.  I also have<BR>
fibromyalgia and the doctor and I are trying various combinations of<BR>
medications trying to get me to sleep (I have trouble falling asleep, only<BR>
stay asleep 3 hours at a time, and wake up hurting and unable to sleep more<BR>
after about 6 hours).  Different medications have different affects but none<BR>
seems to work for more than two days (my body adjusts too quickly), and all<BR>
of them make a me zombie in the mornings!  Between that and keeping my<BR>
insides on their schedule, I'm still going to leave it in for now.  I'll give<BR>
my body some time to adjust to the change in diet before I take away this<BR>
last crutch.  I am hoping that giving up the sugar and starch will help my<BR>
sleep problems and hopefully improve my energy.  I am encouraged though<BR>
because after 1 week it seems to have really improved the pain from my<BR>
insides and made them quieter and calmer overall.  <BR>

<BR>
It wasn't easy to get there!  It took 4 months to diagnose me.  First I lost<BR>
20 pounds for no reason but wasn't too concerned about that--after all I felt<BR>
fine.  Then, the pain started.  I had agonizing lower abdominal pain as my<BR>
primary symptom.  I walked bent forward a bit from the pain.  Sometimes it<BR>
would surprise me and my knees would go out from under me.  I started with my<BR>
GYN.  He tested everything and even did a laprascopic exam--nothing.  I went<BR>
to a GI who said &quot;female problems&quot; and wouldn't talk to my GYN doc.  I had a<BR>
barium enema which showed nothing.  I went to an internal medicine specialist<BR>
and told him we only had a week left to figure this out before I would be on<BR>
leave without pay.  It was a process of elimination and a very rough week!  I<BR>
think we ran 10 different tests.  At the end of the week the upper GI with<BR>
small bowel follow through showed the classic narrowing.  They repeated it to<BR>
be sure.  They never figured out why the lower GI, which showed the same<BR>
area, didn't show the problem only two weeks before.  Then I had a<BR>
colonoscopy with biopsy and that confirmed it.  Later, I had an endoscopy<BR>
that showed I also had it in my stomach.  I've been slowly improving over the<BR>
last 2.5 years but never achieved remission.  My doctor says I'm permanently<BR>
partially disabled from work.  Recently I realized that my body aches and<BR>
exhaustion had actually gotten worse even though my insides were feeling<BR>
better.  This gave me the clue that perhaps all my symptoms weren't from the<BR>
crohns and that's how I got diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  I'm hoping that we<BR>
have now identified the full cast of players.  I'm still working with my<BR>
rheumatologist to get the fibromyalgia under control, and using SCD to help<BR>
the crohns.  I'm hoping that the combination will get me to remission.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this is useful to you.<BR>

PS.  I left out all the times I ended up ranting and raving and making a<BR>
scene in order to get the doctors to take my pain seriously and pursue a real<BR>
diagnosis and treatment.  One doctor actually told me that the reason he<BR>
hadn't taken me seriously was because I was well put together and well spoken<BR>
when he saw me.  It was hard for him to understand that this is a part of who<BR>
I am, and doesn't mean I'm not in pain!  <BR>

I was wondering about this too.  I've only been on the diet for a week and I<BR>

Some history: I have UC. About 6 months ago, I started the diet with<BR>
excellent results.  I followed the startup diet to the &quot;T&quot; and had<BR>
immediate results -- I began tapering off pred on the second day.  After<BR>
about 6 weeks, I slipped, and had a flare up after about 2 months.<BR>
<BR>
I restarted the diet 9 days ago.  Everything seemed to be going well --<BR>
1 bm per day, no blood (I have UC) and then on the fourth day I started<BR>
to have d, lots of bleeding, pain and felt extremely depressed.  I<BR>
suffered 2 days like that, and on Monday I dropped the diet, eating<BR>
eggs, potatoes, tortilla chips, orange juice, and bacon for breakfast.<BR>
I immediately felt better, and with the addition of sweet potatoes and<BR>
rice to my diet, I've been doing pretty well emotionally, bleeding has<BR>
slowed, by the d is still a problem.<BR>
<BR>
One thing that I wasn't able to use on the startup diet is the grape<BR>
juice and honey.  Both were causing a reaction (I think I have a bad<BR>
case of candida), so I was stuck just eating meat, eggs and yogurt.  I<BR>
don't think that this is sufficient nutrition and I think I had a<BR>
ketosis (basically put -- too much protein) problem.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure, Kim, if ketosis is what is going on with you, but I'd bet<BR>
the lack of carbs is playing a role.  If the depression is unbearable<BR>
(mine was) then I'd consider getting checked out by a doctor or stopping<BR>
the diet.<BR>
<BR>
For myself, I'm a little wary of starting the diet again without grape<BR>
juice and honey.  So for now I'm treating the candida with a typical<BR>
candida diet and following a regimen suggested by someone on the<BR>
maelstrom SCD list as a anti-imflamatory diet.<BR>
<BR>
Anyone know the typical symptoms of ketosis?  Is there a urine test?<BR>

&gt;Dear Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your reply.  Is your oven electric or gas?  I know that the<BR>
pilot light in a gas oven is used for making yogurt; but would just the<BR>
light bulb in an electric oven be enough?  Duhhhhh.<BR>
<BR>
Why do you use starter instead of commercial yogurt?<BR>
<BR>
Sounds like we're all going to be on this diet for the &quot;duration.&quot;  Hmmmm.<BR>
We'd all better get reaaaal creative with these recipes!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I don't know anything about the double decker system. I'd bought a Salton<BR>
&gt;yogurt maker when I first started the diet and sold it at my last garage<BR>
&gt;sale because I wasn't crazy about the yogurt it produced. I use a light<BR>
&gt;bulb in my oven with a pen to prop the door open to let out excess heat. I<BR>
&gt;boil the 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (3 quarts) in my farberware pot and after I've added the<BR>
&gt;starter I just stick the same pot, covered, in my oven. Makes great yogurt.<BR>
&gt;Yes, I'm basically true to the diet, but in the last couple of months I've<BR>
&gt;cheated just a little ( a spoon of this, a taste of that).It hasn't made me<BR>
&gt;ill but I think that the diet is so ingrained in me that I'm terrified that<BR>
&gt;it might. I still haven't touched most of the biggies (pasta, potatoes,<BR>
&gt;rice) and frankly the diet has enough in it to keep me satisfied. I've<BR>
&gt;heard from other people who'd been on the diet successfully for a couple of<BR>
&gt;years, gone off and become ill. In fact as I'm writing this, I'm thinking<BR>
&gt;I'm gonna stay away from temptations before I get into trouble. Thanks for<BR>
&gt;making me look at the situation.<BR>

remained on prednisone for about 2 years.  After being weened off of this<BR>
drug, my brother has been living symptom free for the past 16 years.<BR>

&gt;Do you think it would work to &quot;double decker&quot; the yogurt making?  That is,<BR>
&gt;to buy extra jars and just set them on top of the ones in the yogurt maker;<BR>
&gt;place a towel over all to hold in the heat and let it hum away for 24-36<BR>
&gt;hours?<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, it likely won't work.  I tried it once when I had prepared just<BR>
a little too much milk to make the yogurt.  My yogurt mixture filled up 8 jars<BR>
and my yogurt machine only holds 7.  So I put one on top and cozied the whole<BR>
thing with a towel like I do with sour cream making.  The bottom layer of 7<BR>
turned out fine, but the top one was all curdled and disgusting.  I threw it<BR>
out.  I believe that the temperature on the top decker is too low to incubate<BR>
yogurt.  It works for sour cream perfectly because the culture used for it is<BR>
supposed to ferment at this much lower temperature.  This has been my<BR>
experience.<BR>

Keep in mind that coffee is a laxitive.  I love it but I gave it up.  I gave it<BR>
up because it interferes with homeopathic remedies.  Andrew Weil has a recent<BR>
book with a section on preventive maintenance.  I forget the exact name of the<BR>
book but I think it's Natural Healing or something.  I'll look it up and post<BR>
it later.  Anyway, if you read the section he has on coffee, you would likely<BR>
be inspired to try to cut back or stop drinking it.  I did.  And I was a major<BR>
coffee lover.  I actually photocopied the section a dozen or so times and<BR>
distributed a copy to several of my co-workers and friends whenever the topic<BR>
of coffee came up (which is every day of course, at &quot;coffee-time&quot; as we call<BR>
our breaks).  I don't know if I inspired anyone to cut back on coffee, but at<BR>
least they know the hazards and what it is doing to their bodies.<BR>

&gt; Right now, it's the only way I can get myself to work.  I also have<BR>
&gt;fibromyalgia and the doctor and I are trying various combinations of<BR>
&gt;medications trying to get me to sleep (I have trouble falling asleep, only<BR>
&gt;stay asleep 3 hours at a time, and wake up hurting and unable to sleep more<BR>
&gt;after about 6 hours).  Different medications have different affects but none<BR>
&gt;seems to work for more than two days (my body adjusts too quickly), and all<BR>
&gt;of them make a me zombie in the mornings!<BR>
<BR>
Ellen,<BR>
My friend has CD and FM and she found success using Melatonin to sleep.  If you<BR>
are going to try it, it's important to find a good pharmaceutical quality pill<BR>
and experiment with dosage, starting out with 1 mg or less.  Increase gradually<BR>
to find the dose that works best for you.  If you are interested in this, get<BR>
Ray Sahlien's book on Melatonin.  It is an easy read and so informative.  He<BR>
also has a book on DHEA.<BR>
<BR>
I tried amitryptiline and had very bad effects.  My Gastroenterologist gave it<BR>
to me after I complained of FM-like symptoms.  He called it Affective Spectrum<BR>
Disorder.  Good luck on finding  info on that one.  It's basically a label for<BR>
people who have symptoms that they can't explain.  It turned out that what I<BR>
had was simply Crohn's Arthritis, because it comes and goes.  Lately it's been<BR>
gone for quite a while, knock on wood, and thank goodness.  Anyway, I tried<BR>
Melatonin and would take it and get to sleep in 20 minutes and wake up with no<BR>
fuzziness.  The Amytryptiline, etc did not help, but made me worse.  My friend<BR>
with FM found the same thing.  For all I know, you may already have tried it. <BR>
Just thought I'd pass on some possibly helpful info.<BR>

I enjoyed your Joy of Cooking references.  I myself had looked these up in the<BR>

&gt; Dear Ellen,<BR>
&gt;=20<BR>
&gt; I doubt that Elaine requires that the coffee be very weak just to give =<BR>
us<BR>
&gt; coffee lovers a bad time. My concern with drinking regular strength =<BR>
coffee<BR>
&gt; is that besides propelling the contents of the colon forward, it most<BR>
&gt; likely moves the contents of<BR>
&gt; your small intestine forward also. If the enzymes in the small =<BR>
intestine<BR>
&gt; haven't finished doing their job, then undigested food could be =<BR>
feeding the<BR>
&gt; bacteria and yeast in the colon.<BR>
&gt; There are probably other reasons for restricting strong coffee intake. =<BR>
I'm<BR>
&gt; guessing it might irritate the lining of the intestine.<BR>
&gt; Hopefully, getting off of a high starch diet will correct your morning<BR>
&gt; slugishness, and you won't be &quot;needing&quot; the coffee.<BR>
&gt; With the addictive quality of caffeine I know it's hard it is to kick =<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; habit, but it is necessary, to truly be on the diet. I find I'm better =<BR>
off<BR>
&gt; just staying away from it, because it seems like as with most =<BR>
addictive<BR>
&gt; substances, a little eventually leads to more (weak to stronger). At =<BR>
least<BR>
&gt; that was my experience.<BR>
&gt;=20<BR>
&gt; Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.<BR>
&gt; Lucy<BR>
&gt;=20<BR>
&gt; PS. Of course if you can manage to stick to truly very weak coffee, =<BR>
there<BR>
&gt; should be no problem. The way I deal with it is to have it on rare<BR>
&gt; occasions, rather than make it a daily routine. That way the strength =<BR>
has<BR>
&gt; less of a chance of sneaking up on me.<BR>
I have found that coffee, even weak, still gives me trouble, and I've =<BR>
been on the=20<BR>
diet over 1 1/2 years!  I can't seem to stay away from it, since it =<BR>
stimulates my=20<BR>

sleep, I know. But that is a bit of a stretch at the moment, as I =<BR>

school, coach soccer, and work full time with a second job!  I think I =<BR>
should just=20<BR>
accept it.  Coffee dosen't work on the diet for me.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Ellen,<BR>
<BR>
I finally got off the coffee about a month ago, however I did cheat and =<BR>
have one cup of coffee a couple of days ago with no problem. For me, it =<BR>
was best that I got off the stuff because I would have trouble after two =<BR>
or three cups.<BR>
<BR>
My coffee habit lasted for about 20 years. I consumed anywhere from a =<BR>
quart to a gallon a day. The habit was so strong that I didn't care what =<BR>
coffee tasted like. I use to identify with an old saying from Louis =<BR>
Lamore (a famous western novelist) &quot;Coffee is perfect when it can float =<BR>
a horse shoe.&quot; I was really hooked.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking the habit was tough, but with determination, I made it. I =<BR>
needed coffee before going on the SCD because I always felt sluggish =<BR>
without the caffeine. But after I'd been on the diet for three weeks, I =<BR>
found that my energy was getting stronger so I decided to make a break =<BR>
with my caffeinated beverage of choice. I had a caffeine withdrawal =<BR>
headache for two days, but then I was fine. The longer I went without =<BR>
the coffee, the more I decided that I didn't need it. Now an occasional =<BR>
cup every one or two weeks is fine, but sometimes I'll only finish 1/2 a =<BR>
cup and I'll dump the rest.<BR>
<BR>
I read somewhere that if you can sustain a change in one of your habits =<BR>
for twenty-one straight days, that the change will become your new =<BR>
habit. For me this concept works.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Glenn<BR>

RE:Asacol<BR>
I  just began the diet this week and was upset to see in someone's<BR>
message that Asacol has lactose in it. I immediately quit taking it  and<BR>
am now wondering which of my other meds has lactose, starch or sugar in<BR>
them. Does anyone know of a source online that I could go to in order to<BR>
check?<BR>
I also stopped my Questran because it contains Nutrasweet &amp; sucrose. I<BR>
am now<BR>
wondering about my gelcap Rx's like Imodium,Prilosec,etc.<BR>
Where can I find out what's okay to take? I currently have my pharmacist<BR>
looking up all the package inserts to see listed inert ingredients, but<BR>
it's going to take her until Friday at the earliest to get back to me.<BR>
I am on my second day of the diet and the only thing I've taken is<BR>
lomotil &amp; reglan.<BR>
RE:reaction to Asacol<BR>
After numerous tries at upping the dose, I've found I can only tolerate<BR>
5/day. If I go up to 6, I get increased diarrhea. Maybe some of you<BR>

Hi Lynn,<BR>

I could never take asacol. I tried three times and had nothing but =<BR>
problems. I also never had to take predisone. However, azufidine has =<BR>
worked for me for the last three years. My dose was two 500mg four times =<BR>
a day. Every time I reduced the amount I started having trouble. But, =<BR>
about two weeks a go I change my dosage to 1 tablet four times a day and =<BR>
I'm still doing fine. I've been on the diet for a month and a half.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to take asacol, I've read some postings that say taking =<BR>
lactaide with the asacol seems to help.<BR>

I was wondering about this too.  I've only been on the diet for a week =<BR>

got a real sudden mood swing the other night.  Depressed, crying.  Then =<BR>
the<BR>
next day I felt about the same! (I figured a night's sleep would solve =<BR>
it but<BR>
it didn't)   It's very unusual for me so it made me wonder.  I figured =<BR>
it was<BR>
from not getting enough sleep, but then wondered if giving up sugar =<BR>

cause some emotional instability as the body adjusts.<BR>

Hi Ellen and Jim,<BR>

I've been on the diet for a month and a half and I've actually been =<BR>
feeling better, mood wise. I was never prone to depression before I went =<BR>
on the diet and I haven't had any depression spells since I went on the =<BR>

better.<BR>

&gt; &gt; of it.  This ritual has always been important for motivating my =<BR>
bowels in<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt; morning and therefore having my body be comfortable during the day.<BR>
&gt; Cutting<BR>
&gt; &gt; that out along with everything else seemed like too drastic a change =<BR>
for<BR>
&gt; my<BR>
&gt; &gt; system, and unnecessary since I don't have diareaha.  I don't drink<BR>
&gt; coffee<BR>
&gt; &gt; any other time of the day though.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; Dear Ellen,<BR>
&gt;=20<BR>
&gt; I doubt that Elaine requires that the coffee be very weak just to give =<BR>
us<BR>
&gt; coffee lovers a bad time. My concern with drinking regular strength =<BR>
coffee<BR>
&gt; is that besides propelling the contents of the colon forward, it most<BR>
&gt; likely moves the contents of<BR>
&gt; your small intestine forward also. If the enzymes in the small =<BR>
intestine<BR>
&gt; haven't finished doing their job, then undigested food could be =<BR>
feeding the<BR>
&gt; bacteria and yeast in the colon.<BR>
&gt; There are probably other reasons for restricting strong coffee intake. =<BR>
I'm<BR>
&gt; guessing it might irritate the lining of the intestine.<BR>
&gt; Hopefully, getting off of a high starch diet will correct your morning<BR>
&gt; slugishness, and you won't be &quot;needing&quot; the coffee.<BR>
&gt; With the addictive quality of caffeine I know it's hard it is to kick =<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; habit, but it is necessary, to truly be on the diet. I find I'm better =<BR>
off<BR>
&gt; just staying away from it, because it seems like as with most =<BR>
addictive<BR>
&gt; substances, a little eventually leads to more (weak to stronger). At =<BR>
least<BR>
&gt; that was my experience.<BR>
&gt;=20<BR>
&gt; Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.<BR>
&gt; Lucy<BR>
&gt;=20<BR>
&gt; PS. Of course if you can manage to stick to truly very weak coffee, =<BR>
there<BR>
&gt; should be no problem. The way I deal with it is to have it on rare<BR>
&gt; occasions, rather than make it a daily routine. That way the strength =<BR>
has<BR>
&gt; less of a chance of sneaking up on me.<BR>
I have found that coffee, even weak, still gives me trouble, and I've =<BR>
been on the=20<BR>
diet over 1 1/2 years!  I can't seem to stay away from it, since it =<BR>
stimulates my=20<BR>
mind out of the fog it often finds itself.  I wish there were an =<BR>
alternative.  More=20<BR>
sleep, I know. But that is a bit of a stretch at the moment, as I =<BR>
prepare for grad.=20<BR>
school, coach soccer, and work full time with a second job!  I think I =<BR>
should just=20<BR>
accept it.  Coffee dosen't work on the diet for me.<BR>
<BR>
Hi Ellen,<BR>
<BR>
I finally got off the coffee about a month ago, however I did cheat and =<BR>
have one cup of coffee a couple of days ago with no problem. For me, it =<BR>
was best that I got off the stuff because I would have trouble after two =<BR>
or three cups.<BR>
<BR>
My coffee habit lasted for about 20 years. I consumed anywhere from a =<BR>
quart to a gallon a day. The habit was so strong that I didn't care what =<BR>
coffee tasted like. I use to identify with an old saying from Louis =<BR>
Lamore (a famous western novelist) &quot;Coffee is perfect when it can float =<BR>
a horse shoe.&quot; I was really hooked.<BR>
<BR>
Breaking the habit was tough, but with determination, I made it. I =<BR>
needed coffee before going on the SCD because I always felt sluggish =<BR>
without the caffeine. But after I'd been on the diet for three weeks, I =<BR>
found that my energy was getting stronger so I decided to make a break =<BR>
with my caffeinated beverage of choice. I had a caffeine withdrawal =<BR>
headache for two days, but then I was fine. The longer I went without =<BR>
the coffee, the more I decided that I didn't need it. Now an occasional =<BR>
cup every one or two weeks is fine, but sometimes I'll only finish 1/2 a =<BR>
cup and I'll dump the rest.<BR>
<BR>
I read somewhere that if you can sustain a change in one of your habits =<BR>
for twenty-one straight days, that the change will become your new =<BR>
habit. For me this concept works.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

Dear Lynn,<BR>
Not only did I not respond to Asacol, but I lost a lot of ground during the<BR>

stopped taking it almost 4 years ago and haven't needed anything but the<BR>
diet since.<BR>
A pharmacist once told me that he felt people did bettter on Dipentum than<BR>
Asacol. They are supposed to be similar drugs made by different companies. <BR>
Also, there is Azulfadine which has been around for a long time. I was<BR>
under the impression that the newer drugs were supposed to be better, but<BR>
I've heard that Azulfadine has bacteria killing properties that the newer<BR>
ones don't have. Apparently, newer isn't always better. Drug companies have<BR>
been known to bring out a new expensive drug, when the old one's patent has<BR>
run out. Rachel said she took Azulfadine during the first year or so on the<BR>
diet and did well with it. You might ask her about that. <BR>
Let us know how you do.<BR>

Hi Jim,<BR>
Regarding depression, it sure is a tough one to figure out.  Having<BR>
chronic health problems on top of life in general, it's hard to not get<BR>
depressed sometimes.  At least I do.  Sometimes though, when I feel<BR>
depressed, I realize what I mostly am is tired.  That is the biggest<BR>
drag, is dealing with low energy.  I personally feel that half the time<BR>
people talk about depression, it's really deep, &quot;bone level&quot; fatigue. <BR>
Don't get me wrong, though, I'm not saying all depression is this.  I<BR>
just mean sometimes it's hard to figure it out. Lately I've been taking<BR>
mineral supplements, calcium citrate and magnesium, etc. because I heard<BR>
that these are more likely to be deficient in those of us with<BR>
absorbtion problems.  These have helped keep my energy levels a little<BR>
more consistent, which is a good thing.  Take care.<BR>

Ditto for me on that, Ellen.  Some of us tend toward the stoic,<BR>

like we're supposed to when we really are as sick or sicker than a lot<BR>

a hard time getting docs to take me seriously about my problems.<BR>

<BR>
Just thought I'd share my experience with that last one, since you all<BR>
are likely to understand.  I just returned from a four-day wedding in<BR>
North-western Washington state.  It was out in the boonies at a resort<BR>
where everything was canned and bottled -- even at this &quot;exclusive&quot;<BR>
restaurant at the resort!  I subsisted on apples, carrots, canned tuna<BR>
and this &quot;gourmet&quot; fresh guacamole sold at this exclusive gourmet<BR>
country store that went for $8.95 a jar!!!  I was so desperate.  The<BR>
hardest part was not actually gettting the food but trying to eat the<BR>
food while I was a bridesmaid and was actively trying to coordinate the<BR>
wedding -- and most of the 4-day weekend's activities were centered<BR>
around food.  The bride had tried to take me into consideration in her<BR>
planning, but, like most people who don't undersatnd the diet, had lots<BR>
of veggie salads with pasta, corn and bottled dressings.  Ughhh.  It was<BR>
hell.  I broke down emotionally (in private, fortunately) at one or two<BR>
points, from exhaustion in general, but also from malnutrition. <BR>
Fortunately I have a very understanding husband who was more than there<BR>
for me and helped go buy the guacamole when I was too dizzy to manage. <BR>
Sorry, I had to vent all this, it feels like no one else understands how<BR>
difficult it is to stay on this diet sometimes when away from home. <BR>
Taking chances on mystery ingredients in restaurants and such.  I came<BR>
home and cooked and cooked and cooked.  And ate and ate and ate! Thanks<BR>

Hello Everyone!<BR>
<BR>
  This talk about coffee really hits home with me.  I empathize entirely<BR>
with everyone &quot;holding on&quot; to their last tiny vice.  Alas, me, too, and I<BR>
have only given it up this week.  I am amazed at how much better I am<BR>
sleeping, and how much less my tummy complains.  Calmer, indeed.  I didn't<BR>
really think I had a sleep &quot;problem.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
  I didn't think I was having that much coffee.  I drank two to three<BR>
(strong, I blush to admit) cups in the AM, and once in awhile, when out to<BR>
dinner, I'd have another cup as my &quot;treat&quot;.  Who knows what I've been<BR>
treating myself to!  In retrospect, I'd quit it a lot sooner if I had it to<BR>
do over, although, I understand the need for psychological space to choose<BR>
that time.<BR>
<BR>
  I went through one heck of a headache morning.  An Alleve pill helped.<BR>
That was it.  After about four days we started drinking a single cup of<BR>
high quality decaf.  I'm very careful with it, however, and at the least<BR>
sign, I'll put it down.  Oh yes, the ritual is a social one, and the fact<BR>
that my beloved one gave it up too, to help me, gave me an additional<BR>
boost, although I didn't really want him to have to give it up for me.  It<BR>
did help.<BR>
<BR>
  I managed to rationalize my way through (or simply defer the inevitable?)<BR>
about a year and a half on the diet without really giving up coffee.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
  After &quot;starting over&quot; six months ago, I've gotten a lot better, but with<BR>
a 1x/day relapse of diarreah after about three months (and an occasional<BR>
weak day).<BR>
<BR>
  I still don't eat much fruit or vegetables.  The one vegetable that<BR>
really sustains and agrees with me is butternut squash.  I also bake six<BR>
apples at a time and don't eat the skins.  (Let me clarify that -I don't<BR>
eat all six at a time).  Still can't eat nuts (except ground into flour for<BR>
bread) or cheese.  But I keep testing, very slowly.  All in all, this diet<BR>
has saved my life, I'm sure. I've stopped losing weight and grateful as<BR>
all.<BR>
<BR>
  Sorry to have been out of touch.  Too much to do and too little time and<BR>
energy to get it all in.  Familiar story?<BR>
<BR>
Best to everyone.  Carolyn<BR>
<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks for your insights and I think you make some interesting points.  I<BR>
&gt;hadn't thought of the details of how it might affect the intestines.  I will<BR>
&gt;probably give it up at some point--especially if I can wake up feeling good!<BR>
&gt; Right now, it's the only way I can get myself to work.  I also have<BR>
&gt;fibromyalgia and the doctor and I are trying various combinations of<BR>
&gt;medications trying to get me to sleep (I have trouble falling asleep, only<BR>
&gt;stay asleep 3 hours at a time, and wake up hurting and unable to sleep more<BR>
&gt;after about 6 hours).  Different medications have different affects but none<BR>
&gt;seems to work for more than two days (my body adjusts too quickly), and all<BR>
&gt;of them make a me zombie in the mornings!  Between that and keeping my<BR>
&gt;insides on their schedule, I'm still going to leave it in for now.  I'll give<BR>
&gt;my body some time to adjust to the change in diet before I take away this<BR>
&gt;last crutch.  I am hoping that giving up the sugar and starch will help my<BR>
&gt;sleep problems and hopefully improve my energy.  I am encouraged though<BR>
&gt;because after 1 week it seems to have really improved the pain from my<BR>
&gt;insides and made them quieter and calmer overall.<BR>

You can buy urine test sticks in any drug store although you may have to ask<BR>

To all that have chimed in with dittos to this one, please include me! I've<BR>

healthy. I guess its hard to take me seriously when I claim to be in agony<BR>
even though I've just worked 8 hours, taken a martial arts class, done my<BR>
housework and made sure dinner was on the table. It just makes me want to<BR>

you are stoic and won't succumb to the pain. I was on nortryptaline for a<BR>
while for the FM, but its usefullness was shortlived. I kept having to take<BR>
more and more with less and less results. I finally gave up on it. I take a<BR>
lot of tylonal and when the pain becomes unbearable, I take a percocet<BR>
(maybe once or twice a month). As for the asocal VS azulphadine, I was on<BR>
azulphadine for about 8 years total and it did help. I guess its been about<BR>

Dear Rachel,<BR>
Just to be sure...before I make 3 quarts (like you do) and have to toss it<BR>
out...let me test my understanding of your method, of making yogurt, using<BR>
an electric oven:<BR>
<BR>
All you do is after you place the yogurt container in the oven is put a pen<BR>
in between the oven space and the door to keep it from getting too warm?<BR>
<BR>
Did you check with a thermometer, to make sure it was between 100-110?<BR>
<BR>
This sounds like the easiest method by far...the way you do it...and I<BR>
can't wait.  I need to make yogurt tomorrow...so please answer back<BR>
quickly, okay?  Of course, you always do anyway!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks, Rachel.   Prateeksha<BR>

with closed door). I keep thermometer in the oven so I can checkit every<BR>
few hours to make sure it doesn't go above 110. Good luck. Can't wait to<BR>
hear how your's came out.<BR>

I take 9 asacols a day.  I am seeing great benefit from the diet and no<BR>

<BR>
If you are truly lactose intolerant you should work with your doctor on an<BR>
alternative rather than just stop taking everything (one guy who was having<BR>
problems with the asacol was fine when he took lactaid with his meds).  If<BR>
you are not intolerant, try the diet while you continue your meds.  Only<BR>
change one thing at a time so you can truly see the effect of the change.  If<BR>
you stop all your meds to go on the diet and get really ill, you won't know<BR>
what caused the problem.  Get well first, then see what you want to do.<BR>
<BR>
No one is advocating this diet as a replacement for prescribed medication.<BR>
 Some people have gotten so well on the diet that they found they no longer<BR>
needed their medication, but they didn't stop taking it the first week (more<BR>
like a year later).<BR>
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.<BR>

Hi there,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everyone who has added their name to the list of SCD <BR>
participants on the Yogurt24 web site. The URL is: <BR>
http://www.triplesoft.com/yogurt24/partic.html<BR>
<BR>
The list on this web page is a great way for all of us to see:<BR>
1. who is on the diet (name, age, location, medical condition)<BR>
2. how long they've been on the diet (i.e. under one month, 1-3 months, <BR>
4-6 months, etc.)<BR>
<BR>
The list is also a wonderful resource for anyone who is beginning the <BR>
diet.<BR>
<BR>
In order to keep the list on this web page current, we need your help:<BR>
<BR>
---If you have already added your name to the web page---<BR>
please stop by and take a second to fill out the 'update listing' form <BR>
(located at the top of the web page) if your length of time on the diet <BR>
has changed (i.e. 1-3 months, 4-6 months, etc.)<BR>
<BR>
---If you haven't added your name to the web page---<BR>
please stop by the web page and complete the 'add your name' form, <BR>

I suspect that Elaine whould have had a snowball's chance in hell to get<BR>
her book published without some kind of &quot;link&quot; to the<BR>
medical-pharmaceutical machine by telling us not to stop our meds<BR>
without the advice of our physicians.  If you are like me, you have a<BR>
doctor who refuses to acknowledge the extent of diet in controlling<BR>
Colitis (and possibly chrones-I have no experience there) and know when<BR>
you need or don't need meds. Obviously, prednisone needs to be tapered<BR>
off slowly.  I have found asacol a mixed blessing. When I took 6 tablets<BR>
a day, I bled.  Now I take only 3 a day (one at  a time) and I believe<BR>
it helps with the diet, but dosen't give me any bad effects.  I feel<BR>
that being on the diet negates the need for lots of drugs (eventually<BR>
for any drugs, for that matter).  Since my doctor dosen't want to face<BR>
the prospect that diet is curing me, I feel compelled to alter my<BR>
prescriptions accordingly (ie.. less does the trick for me). I expect to<BR>
drop it entirely soon, but, I think it does help, in small quantities.<BR>

I appreciate your sharing your experience.  I think you have real guts to<BR>

haven't been away from home overnight on the diet yet (I've been carrying my<BR>

to be a bit creative to work that one out, but at least it's not until<BR>
Spring.<BR>
<BR>
I've gone out to a restaurant only once since on the diet.  I had to take an<BR>
employee to lunch.  I picked a really good place and then explained to the<BR>
waiter that I was on a medically restricted diet and that I need plain<BR>
grilled salmon with nothing on it, and some sliced fresh tomatoes on my<BR>
plate.  They were able to accomodate that.  (I figured citing it as medical<BR>

My husband, Mike, who has had Crohn's (very severe case) for 24 years has<BR>
been on the diet since December.  In April we had to travel (out of state<BR>
medical trip) and be out of our home for 5 days.  One of his staples is the<BR>
pizza recipe in Elaine's book (zuchinni crust).  I bake the pizza on cookie<BR>
sheets and cut them into squares and freeze them in the Tupperware sandwich<BR>
keepers.  I make about 16 squares at a time, and then he can zap them in<BR>
the microwave when he wants to eat.  For the trip I packed all his food.<BR>
It needed to stay frozen for the 7 or 8 hours from our house to the hotel.<BR>
I got a soft-sided cooler made by Igloo, and packed about 10 of the pizza<BR>
squares, 5 frozen patties of ground round, 1 quart of homemade yogurt, 16<BR>
frozen chicken nuggets (recipe from the book where you grind the chicken,<BR>
and then mix with egg and almond flour and fry),  and everything stayed<BR>
frozen.  Then I put it all in the freezer in our hotel room.  It worked<BR>
well.<BR>

commercial yogurt to a quart of 1/2 &amp; 1/2). Page 134 says use 1/2 cup<BR>
commercial yogurt to 2 cups of 1/2 &amp; 1/2, which means that I've been using<BR>
HALF the recommended amount. I should be using 1 cup per quart. I feel like<BR>
an idiot, math is supposed to be my forte. Since my yogurt has been coming<BR>
out perfectly, I'm not sure I should change. Do you think using more<BR>
commercial yogurt would benefit?<BR>

The only brand available here that is OK is Dannon.  I was just curious if<BR>
you thought Dannon was OK.  I don't have my book here at work.  Do you use<BR>
more yogurt starter for half and half than you do for whole milk?  I've<BR>
been using half a cup of yogurt starter per two quarts whole milk.  I also<BR>
tried that amount for a batch that was 50% half and half and 50% whole<BR>
milk.  Definitely thicker and creamier.<BR>

This is true, it's not easy.  My office had a retreat planned and I think I got<BR>
so stressed out worrying about it that it caused a flare.  I had heard that the<BR>
menus were all pre-ordered with little choice and that usually people go out<BR>
drinking and socializing and what not.  This made me even more aprehensive.  I<BR>
had planned to go and bring my own food in a cooler.  I called the hotel and<BR>
requested a mini fridge in  my room.  I was just going to eat cold food and<BR>
deal with it.  It was only going to be 2 days.  Finally I felt so sick that I<BR>
told my boss I had to stay behind because I wasn't feeling well and didn't want<BR>
to be far from home.  I kept going to work, but didn't participate in the<BR>
retreat.  I hope that I can go the next time.<BR>

&gt;PS.  How do others deal with these kinds of situations?  How do you prevent<BR>

<BR>
It's hard.  I told my friend's mother about it in detail, yet when I went for<BR>
dinner, she thought she was so good at adhering to my diet but she used bottled<BR>
barbeque sauce on the bbq ribs and the vegies were cooked crispy, when I need<BR>
them well done.  I ate it anyway, because I didn't want to be rude or make a<BR>
scene.  So, it's not easy, but it can be done.  I think if I had spoken to her<BR>
ahead of time and found out what she was making I could have told her not to<BR>
put any sauce on mine and that I need my vegies boiled.  We need to be more<BR>
assertive and less afraid of offending people I think.<BR>

Don't worry about it.  It is not necessary to use more starter. It would<BR>
probably work just as well with a quarter cup.  All you need is a few bacteria<BR>
and they multiply like crazy.  You must have seen those movies in school about<BR>
bacteria and it shows how they rampantly multiply.  Well, if it's working fine,<BR>
then don't change anything.  I doubt it affects the lactose level.  I found<BR>
that cream is no different from milk in terms of making yogurt.  It just has<BR>
more fat so it turns out richer and creamier.  But both are completely firm. <BR>
If you get firm yogurt that is not lumpy, curdled, or runny, then you are ok.<BR>
