Hi Steve,<BR>
Your babaganoush (with red peppers) turned out great. Do you serve it<BR>
with anything in particular? Also, can you tell us what is the ethnic<BR>
origin of babaganoush?<BR>
Thanks.<BR>

&gt;I would love it if we could get Elaine to comment as she has studied the<BR>
&gt;effects of food on the intestine.  I would love to know if she thinks<BR>
&gt;food combining is bunk!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;It occured to me that fruit, no matter when, and with what you eat it,<BR>
&gt;will move through the intestines at the rate of the slowest moving meal<BR>
&gt;that you ate.<BR>
<BR>
Why do you form that conclusion?<BR>
<BR>
They way my ND explained it was that each of the specific food groups<BR>
(fruits , veggies, proteins, starches) required their own specific pH<BR>
(acid/base balance) to be optimally digested.  So if one mixes foods, esp.<BR>
if one is ill, you're throwing foods into the mix that can't be optimally<BR>
digested, thus you'll get fermentation or putrefaction (the former for<BR>
fruits &amp; starches, the latter for proteins) instead of optomal digestion.<BR>
<BR>
Another way of looking at it was a biochemist friend of mine; she explained<BR>
that diff. foods require diff enzymes, and that the speed of digestion<BR>
differs for each: carbo's are most-easily attacked by the enzymes, thus<BR>
move fastest through the system, then follow proteins, and slowest are fats.  <BR>
<BR>
So ideally one would eat carbo's (fruits &amp; starches) first or by<BR>
themselves, then proteins, then fats (though proteins &amp; fats can be eaten<BR>
together, which is of course how nature often packages them, since they're<BR>
both much slower-movers).<BR>
<BR>
There are other theories of food combining, these are the 2 that make some<BR>
sense to me.<BR>
<BR>
So maybe explain why you believe that &quot;fruits should be eaten with the<BR>
slowest-moving&quot; meal (I presume you mean meal component,) thus, to<BR>
&quot;translate&quot; your belief, one would eat fruit with proteins.  This would run<BR>
counter to all the food-combining protocols I've heard of (the exception<BR>
being that one can eat ACID fruits, like grapefruit, with proteins).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;  So if you eat something the takes a long time to digest,<BR>
&gt;and it is in you  intestines, then you eat fruit, it will still only<BR>
&gt;move through at the rate of the previous meal you ate.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
The stomach and the bowels constantly churn &amp; mix the &quot;food&quot; into a mixture<BR>
called &quot;chyme&quot;, but I believe there are 2 things that can then happen:<BR>
either the chyme is &quot;filtered&quot; by metabolic processes so that<BR>
easily-0digested food get the &quot;green light&quot; and are filtered out to &quot;race<BR>
ahead&quot;, or the mix sort of &quot;glues them all together&quot; which would then force<BR>
the differently-digesting food to stay together, thus leading to<BR>
putrefaction and/or fermentation (which are NOT desirable in the bowel!).<BR>
<BR>
I'd love to hear why you believe what you do ...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;As I said previously, I am experimenting and so far have not found<BR>
&gt;myself bloating etc.  <BR>
<BR>
Well, if you're basing it on personal experience, that of course is the<BR>
most valid &quot;proof of the pudding&quot; ahead of any outsider's &quot;theory&quot;!  Be<BR>
true to yourself, you've heard of that, eh?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I wonder if the issue is really eating ANY kind of<BR>
&gt;food with complex carbos like bread.  <BR>
<BR>
Maybe that's the key: my ND insists that all starches can only be eaten<BR>
with fruits or veggies, thus, this is another way of saying &quot;carbo's with<BR>
carbo's&quot;, but not wit proteins.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I know, that I know, if I eat a<BR>
&gt;tuna fish sandwich, that the bread is going to cause me lots of<BR>
&gt;problems!  <BR>
<BR>
Ah, see: &quot;protein with carbo&quot;, thus not right for you!?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;If I eat bread by itself, I am going to have problems<BR>
<BR>
Well, of course, Elaine says IBD'ers should stay away from ALL refined<BR>
starches aka carbo's, right?<BR>
<BR>
	Dietmar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;.  I'll<BR>
&gt;bet if I eat a bannana sandwich, I would feel real bad!!  Perhaps fruit<BR>
&gt;has gotten a bum rap because people usually eat complex carbos with it,<BR>
&gt;bloat like crazy and blame the fruit!!  It is a theory anyway.  Any<BR>
&gt;experts wish to comment?  Elaine??<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;pat<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Pat,<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; What a coincidence that you brought up the food combination issue.  I<BR>
&gt;&gt; was<BR>
&gt;&gt; just thinking the same thing when I read about eating fruit with<BR>
&gt;&gt; yougurt or<BR>
&gt;&gt; cheese.  According to books such as Fit For Life, and other ones I<BR>
&gt;&gt; read,<BR>
&gt;&gt; fruit should be eaten alone on an empty stomach 30 min. before a meal<BR>
&gt;&gt; or 4-6<BR>
&gt;&gt; hours after a protein or starch meal.<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Like you said, the fruit requires minimal time to digest (20-45<BR>
&gt;&gt; minutes:dried<BR>
&gt;&gt; fruit and bananas take 45 minutes) while proteins take about 4 hours.<BR>
&gt;&gt;  According to the literature, fruit that becomes trapped with other<BR>
&gt;&gt; food in<BR>
&gt;&gt; the stomach begins to ferment, potentially causing the entire contents<BR>
&gt;&gt; to<BR>
&gt;&gt; putrify and cause gas and bloating.  OK, I know some of us can do<BR>
&gt;&gt; without the<BR>
&gt;&gt; excess gas ad bloating.  Also, according the these authors, improper<BR>
&gt;&gt; food<BR>
&gt;&gt; combination can cause havoc on the digestive system and wear it down<BR>
&gt;&gt; along<BR>
&gt;&gt; with destroying the integrity of the food by fermenting it or causing<BR>
&gt;&gt; it to<BR>
&gt;&gt; putrify.  So, what quality of nutrients are we absorbing then?<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; I found that when I used to eat fruit at meals I used to develop<BR>
&gt;&gt; terrible<BR>
&gt;&gt; stomach aches which mistakenly I blamed the fruit and became afraid to<BR>
&gt;&gt; eat<BR>
&gt;&gt; them.  After I found out about food combination, I ate fruit alone<BR>
&gt;&gt; with no<BR>
&gt;&gt; problem.  <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Fruit also helps cleanse the intestines, and sometimes fruit reacts<BR>
&gt;&gt; with<BR>
&gt;&gt; remaining intestinal and stomach debris and cause some bloating.<BR>
&gt;&gt; Otherwise<BR>
&gt;&gt; there should be no problem.<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; My question is, if so many nutritionists who study the effects of food<BR>
&gt;&gt; on the<BR>
&gt;&gt; digestive system individually state the same thing about food<BR>
&gt;&gt; combination,<BR>
&gt;&gt; then why hasn't Elaine mention it?  I know we don't have to be<BR>
&gt;&gt; concerned<BR>
&gt;&gt; about combining starch with protein, but I am a little bit concerned<BR>
&gt;&gt; about<BR>
&gt;&gt; fruit and other foods.<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Those of you who read the recipes I posted noticed they are all from<BR>
&gt;&gt; the Fit<BR>
&gt;&gt; For Life Cookbook.  All the fruit-based deserts contain nothing but<BR>
&gt;&gt; fruit,<BR>
&gt;&gt; nuts, seeds, honey, and nut milks which are digestively compatible.<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Any take on this?  If anyone disagrees, remember I am just the<BR>
&gt;&gt; messenger, so<BR>
&gt;&gt; don't kill ME.<BR>

	Hi, Glenn:<BR>
<BR>
I read your e-mail with great interest.<BR>
<BR>
I've not met a similar person as your spiritual reader; I'm 42, never<BR>
married &amp; child-free, and have never been a &quot;helper / minister&quot; to others,<BR>
but always beleived people need to stand up on their own two feet ... if<BR>
they ASK for my help, I'll consider the request and may / may not help them<BR>
depending on circumstances and what &lt;&lt;&lt; I &gt;&gt;&gt; decide.<BR>
<BR>
So, since this seems to not fit the pattern she describes as leading to<BR>
Crohn's in your case, I guess that leaves the jury out on that one, eh?<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, I have colitis, not Crohn's, so maybe her stuff doesn't<BR>
apply to that?<BR>
<BR>
A good letter you wrote, in any case ... one just never knows.  I've had a<BR>
few &quot;weird&quot; experiences, and so has my mom (she only recently told me!),<BR>
things we can't explain.  I keep my decisions &quot;un-decided&quot; at this point.<BR>
My attitude is &quot;when I see little green aliens land in my back yard and<BR>
feed kibbles to the dog, THEN I'll know what to believe&quot;!<BR>

Some people have luck easing nausea with ginger tea.  You grate some fresh<BR>

I get very few colds/flu (Crohn's since 1966). Maybe 1 every few years. I'm not around school age<BR>

Dietmar,<BR>
<BR>
The point I was trying to make was that it seemed to me to be logical<BR>
that if I ate a steak or worse a pork chop, it supposedly moves through<BR>
the intestinal tract at a rather slow speed, (except for those of us<BR>
with bad diahrea, it may move through rather quickly :-)).  Let's then<BR>
say that 5 hours later I eat an apple.  It supposedly moves out of our<BR>
stomach in less than 30 minutes.  It then runs smack into that old pork<BR>
chop we ate.  That apple is then going to proceed through the intestines<BR>
at the same rate as that Pork chop, thus seemingly, having every<BR>
opportunity to &quot;putrify etc&quot; as if I had eaten it at the same time as<BR>
the pork chop.<BR>
<BR>
Now I have heard most of the theories on food combining, and some seem<BR>
to make some sense (except that everybodies theories on combining seems<BR>
to be different and literally changes even with the seasons), but if<BR>
they were really valid, it would seem that virtually all<BR>
nutritionists/dieticians who study foods affectsw on our bodies write<BR>
books such as &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot;, &quot;The Zone&quot;, &quot;Protien Power&quot;,<BR>
&quot;Lean Bodies&quot; would call serious attenton to the need to properly<BR>
combine foods.  Instead, TOTAL silence on the subject.  <BR>
<BR>
My original question, which by the way, I have faxed to Elaine and await<BR>
her reply, was &quot;is food combining a myth??&quot;  My question is still<BR>
unanswered. <BR>
<BR>
I recognize that everyones physiological individuality may play a<BR>
serious role here with allergies and different levels of health coming<BR>
into play. It seems possible to me that what someone discovered works<BR>
for them, in terms of what foods seem to be most comfortable for them,<BR>
could then be put in a book and generalized for everyone saying &quot;This is<BR>
the way everyone should eat since it worked for me.&quot;  That is my<BR>
question.  Is food combining a <BR>
NON-GENERAL kind of issue or is it a major issue for everyone to be<BR>
concerned about?  I SUSPECT (don't know for sure) it may not be<BR>
generally an issue, except in some individualized cases.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this clarifies what and why I am asking this question.<BR>

&gt; &gt;I would love it if we could get Elaine to comment as she has studied<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt;effects of food on the intestine.  I would love to know if she thinks<BR>
&gt; &gt;food combining is bunk!<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;It occured to me that fruit, no matter when, and with what you eat<BR>
&gt; it,<BR>
&gt; &gt;will move through the intestines at the rate of the slowest moving<BR>
&gt; meal<BR>
&gt; &gt;that you ate.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Why do you form that conclusion?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; They way my ND explained it was that each of the specific food groups<BR>
&gt; (fruits , veggies, proteins, starches) required their own specific pH<BR>
&gt; (acid/base balance) to be optimally digested.  So if one mixes foods,<BR>
&gt; esp.<BR>
&gt; if one is ill, you're throwing foods into the mix that can't be<BR>
&gt; optimally<BR>
&gt; digested, thus you'll get fermentation or putrefaction (the former for<BR>
&gt; fruits &amp; starches, the latter for proteins) instead of optomal<BR>
&gt; digestion.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Another way of looking at it was a biochemist friend of mine; she<BR>
&gt; explained<BR>
&gt; that diff. foods require diff enzymes, and that the speed of digestion<BR>
&gt; differs for each: carbo's are most-easily attacked by the enzymes,<BR>
&gt; thus<BR>
&gt; move fastest through the system, then follow proteins, and slowest are<BR>
&gt; fats.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So ideally one would eat carbo's (fruits &amp; starches) first or by<BR>
&gt; themselves, then proteins, then fats (though proteins &amp; fats can be<BR>
&gt; eaten<BR>
&gt; together, which is of course how nature often packages them, since<BR>
&gt; they're<BR>
&gt; both much slower-movers).<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; There are other theories of food combining, these are the 2 that make<BR>
&gt; some<BR>
&gt; sense to me.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; So maybe explain why you believe that &quot;fruits should be eaten with the<BR>
&gt; slowest-moving&quot; meal (I presume you mean meal component,) thus, to<BR>
&gt; &quot;translate&quot; your belief, one would eat fruit with proteins.  This<BR>
&gt; would run<BR>
&gt; counter to all the food-combining protocols I've heard of (the<BR>
&gt; exception<BR>
&gt; being that one can eat ACID fruits, like grapefruit, with proteins).<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;  So if you eat something the takes a long time to digest,<BR>
&gt; &gt;and it is in you  intestines, then you eat fruit, it will still only<BR>
&gt; &gt;move through at the rate of the previous meal you ate.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The stomach and the bowels constantly churn &amp; mix the &quot;food&quot; into a<BR>
&gt; mixture<BR>
&gt; called &quot;chyme&quot;, but I believe there are 2 things that can then happen:<BR>
&gt; either the chyme is &quot;filtered&quot; by metabolic processes so that<BR>
&gt; easily-0digested food get the &quot;green light&quot; and are filtered out to<BR>
&gt; &quot;race<BR>
&gt; ahead&quot;, or the mix sort of &quot;glues them all together&quot; which would then<BR>
&gt; force<BR>
&gt; the differently-digesting food to stay together, thus leading to<BR>
&gt; putrefaction and/or fermentation (which are NOT desirable in the<BR>
&gt; bowel!).<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I'd love to hear why you believe what you do ...<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;As I said previously, I am experimenting and so far have not found<BR>
&gt; &gt;myself bloating etc.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well, if you're basing it on personal experience, that of course is<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; most valid &quot;proof of the pudding&quot; ahead of any outsider's &quot;theory&quot;!<BR>
&gt; Be<BR>
&gt; true to yourself, you've heard of that, eh?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;I wonder if the issue is really eating ANY kind of<BR>
&gt; &gt;food with complex carbos like bread.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Maybe that's the key: my ND insists that all starches can only be<BR>
&gt; eaten<BR>
&gt; with fruits or veggies, thus, this is another way of saying &quot;carbo's<BR>
&gt; with<BR>
&gt; carbo's&quot;, but not wit proteins.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;I know, that I know, if I eat a<BR>
&gt; &gt;tuna fish sandwich, that the bread is going to cause me lots of<BR>
&gt; &gt;problems!  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Ah, see: &quot;protein with carbo&quot;, thus not right for you!?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;If I eat bread by itself, I am going to have problems<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well, of course, Elaine says IBD'ers should stay away from ALL refined<BR>
&gt; starches aka carbo's, right?<BR>

Yes, I have read it and every other book available on Candida.  It<BR>
basically does not tie to SCD at all.  They allow complex carbo's after<BR>
an initial couple of weeks on meat, veges and yogurt, then gradually add<BR>
complex carbos as long as you don't use yeast breads.  Most say never,<BR>
ever eat fruit until most, if not all symptoms are gone, and never eat<BR>
honey!  Very, very different. Elaine says complex carbos undigested is<BR>
what feeds candida and other microbes, the other guys say it is all<BR>
simple sugars that feed them.<BR>
<BR>
All take a very aggressive approach to actively trying to kill the<BR>
Candida with drugs and natural anti-fungals.<BR>

Hi Dietmar,<BR>
<BR>
I've had the desease for aprox. 6 years. I used to have fewer colds then<BR>
others, but then my doctor put me on Prednison. I had three bad<BR>
incidents of pneumonia and broncitis. My doc said I have an intolerence<BR>
for the Prednison and slowly pulled me off Prednison giving me Imurel.<BR>
Since then I've had a cold/flu about once every two to three months.<BR>
<BR>
I'm positiv it's because of the medication - but my doctor says it's<BR>
not.<BR>
<BR>
Are you by any chance on an immune depressiv ?<BR>

in response to if you have candida, should you stay away from fruits and<BR>

not breaking down, therefore becoming food for negative bacteria as instead<BR>
of digesting it, it is turning to garbage. but we need all the help we can<BR>
get, therefore, antifungals and friendly bacteria supplements would be an<BR>
advantage.<BR>

Yes, but Glenn, didn't Elaine say &quot;no stevia&quot;?  I just took my child off<BR>
stevia and am trying very small amounts of honey as a sweetener. If it is ok<BR>
to use stevia, I would like to know.<BR>

&gt;Besides honey, Stevia is the only sweetener that I use. It is about 300<BR>
&gt;times more potent than sugar, has no side effects, and no long range heath<BR>
&gt;problems associated with it. In fact, Stevia can even help heal the user of<BR>
&gt;a variety of heath problems.<BR>

Joan, do you use stevia? I would not use saccharin either. <BR>
<BR>
Elaine  permits aspartame once or twice a week but after what I have read<BR>
about aspartame, it is a powerful neurotoxin! and the FDA gets more<BR>
complaints of headaches and other ill effects from aspartame than anything else.<BR>

Dear Kris,<BR>
<BR>
What are the effects of prednisone on a long term basis? I know a child who<BR>
was on it, he gained a lot of weight, however, his allergies got a lot<BR>
better.  He also had a neurological/schizophrenic type disorder which<BR>
supposedly improved as well. But I wonder about his immune system and his<BR>
health, he is very young, about 4 or 5 I think, and the mom has to fly back<BR>
east to get these treatments.<BR>

I've always believed in food combining principles, but since my<BR>
digestion has improved from being on the SCD, now I find that I can eat<BR>
proteins with fruit and don't notice any problems.  Apple and cheese<BR>
together is one of my favorite combinations.  I never would have done<BR>
this before.  So, now I don't know what to think about the theory!<BR>

How long did it take you between the Psyllium and the SCD for your &quot;D&quot; to go<BR>
away?  And how much psyllium did you take?  One Tbs. of the powder is equal<BR>
to one dose of the pill form.<BR>

&gt;I do believe in this diet, am finding it hard to implement, my son is<BR>
&gt;screaming for his rice bread/lettuce sandwiches.<BR>
&gt;I tried to do it cold turkey, too many tantrums and stress. I am at my wit's<BR>
&gt;end.<BR>
<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
<BR>
Keep at it. I believe I read a while ago on the autism vent list that it<BR>
takes a minimum of 3 times before the child adopts/accepts the new<BR>
habit/diet. Make bread from something allowable.<BR>
<BR>
Moira:<BR>
&gt;Now, even more deprivation, it is hard.<BR>
<BR>
Sheila:<BR>
I don't find the SCD a 'deprivation' diet. I find an extraordinary amount<BR>
of choice. And when I violate the diet, I pay for it intestinally and it<BR>
gets old. I choose from all the fruits, veges, and nuts/seeds first. I let<BR>
go of raw honey because of my teeth. I don't eat dairy. Occasionally I try<BR>
the beans allowed. Did that on a backpack. Found them in dehydrated chipped<BR>
form. I hardly even cook my foods mainly salads and fruits. You have tons<BR>
of cooking choices...one of my clients brought the zucchini muffins to my<BR>
office and added spirulina. I scarfed it. My sister-in-law picked up on the<BR>
honey-ginger chutney and made it as gourmet Christmas gifts for relatives.<BR>
Deprivation is a state of mind!<BR>
My current fruits are watermelon, avocados, and black and red grapes. My<BR>
current veges are curly endive, arrugula, cilantro, spinach with<BR>
cold-pressed olive oil.<BR>
I bought 9 different squash today and i plan to bake them one at a time.<BR>
They are delicious and nutritious and can be used with tahini, sesame<BR>
butter, and as a snack. It's gourd season, now. Pomegranates and persimmon<BR>
are in. You could make a custard of raw persimmon pulp.<BR>
Anyway, allergies or candida or not, there is a way through this with a<BR>
vast variety of foods that heal and help. Sometimes it's trial and error<BR>
finding the right combo and also, the system changes over time, has<BR>
different needs, so tastes will change, new foods will be tried over time.<BR>
I know that some foods agree with me more than others in the SCD circle.<BR>
Mangoes, avos, papaya, greens of all kinds, garlic, carrots, steamed cubed<BR>
beets, pineapple, mushrooms, sesame seeds, flax seed powder, chia seeds,<BR>
olive oil, grapes, persimmon, brussel sprouts, pinto  and black beans<BR>
(don't know if their both allowed), raw pistachios, peppers, eggplant,<BR>
brazil nuts, walnuts although too many will constipate me, soaked almonds<BR>
and tomatoes pureed.<BR>
Let your son guide the way on taste and follow it in the food choices<BR>
within the SCD group.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;He has also tested allergic to wheat of course, dairy, beef, nuts, etc. I<BR>
&gt;still don't understand how he could go from HAVING alleriges, to NOT having<BR>
&gt;allergies on the diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks,<BR>

&gt;There are thousand of kids out there now with candida/antibiotics autism,<BR>

I suggest that those of us who wish to wax philosophically about the<BR>

even in reference to UC or CD, take our discussion to the &quot;other&quot;<BR>

The purpose of that forum is to explore theories and practices relating<BR>

I don't know if it's permitted on SCD, but stevia is an herb.<BR>
It's allowed, even promoted, on an anti-candida diet.<BR>

&gt; Besides honey, Stevia is the only sweetener that I use. It is about 300<BR>
&gt; times more potent than sugar, has no side effects, and no long range heath<BR>
&gt; problems associated with it. In fact, Stevia can even help heal the user of<BR>
&gt; a variety of heath problems.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Marketing Management Systems in Tempe Arizona sells the sweetener. Their<BR>
&gt; phone number is 1-800-947-6417. They will be more than happy to send you<BR>
&gt; literature on the herb, some of which talks about how politics affected the<BR>
&gt; FDA decision to allow aspartame (a known carcinogen) to be permitted as a<BR>
&gt; food additive while at the same time disallowing the use of Stevia in any<BR>
&gt; form (for a few years).<BR>

Even before I started the diet, having hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, I<BR>
would get<BR>
&quot;the shakes&quot; when my blood sugar fell too low between meals.<BR>
<BR>
When I first started the diet I would feel very faint (especially going up<BR>
a flight of stairs)<BR>
and a bit shaky, similar to low blood sugar shakes. I called my<BR>
nutritionist and he advised<BR>
me to eat more protein. He said I can have 5 servings a day of protein on<BR>
this diet.<BR>
<BR>
So if I get shaky and/or faint, I snack on something like peanut butter or<BR>
cheese.<BR>
<BR>
I don't eat just 3 meals a day.  After 8 hours of sleep at night, the blood<BR>
sugar gets real low so<BR>
I have a good breakfast with plenty of protein, a two-egg cheese omelet and<BR>
a zucchini muffin from<BR>
Elaine's book or toast made from almond nut flour with honey or apple<BR>
butter. Between breakfast and<BR>
lunch I snack on peanut butter and between lunch and dinner I usually try<BR>
to have a piece of fruit and<BR>
some cheese or something.  It's the long stretch between dinner and<BR>
breakfast that I haven't worked<BR>
out a solution for so mornings are the hardest.<BR>
<BR>
This is my experience....hope it is useful to you somehow.<BR>

Sheila:<BR>
I don't find the SCD a 'deprivation' diet. I find an extraordinary amount<BR>
of choice. And when I violate the diet, I pay for it intestinally and it<BR>
gets old. I choose from all the fruits, veges, and nuts/seeds first. I let<BR>
go of raw honey because of my teeth. I don't eat dairy. Occasionally I try<BR>
the beans allowed. Did that on a backpack. Found them in dehydrated chipped<BR>
form. I hardly even cook my foods mainly salads and fruits. You have tons<BR>
of cooking choices...one of my clients brought the zucchini muffins to my<BR>
office and added spirulina. I scarfed it. My sister-in-law picked up on the<BR>
honey-ginger chutney and made it as gourmet Christmas gifts for relatives.<BR>
Deprivation is a state of mind!<BR>
My current fruits are watermelon, avocados, and black and red grapes. My<BR>
current veges are curly endive, arrugula, cilantro, spinach with<BR>
cold-pressed olive oil.<BR>
I bought 9 different squash today and i plan to bake them one at a time.<BR>
They are delicious and nutritious and can be used with tahini, sesame<BR>
butter, and as a snack. It's gourd season, now. Pomegranates and persimmon<BR>
are in. You could make a custard of raw persimmon pulp.<BR>
Anyway, allergies or candida or not, there is a way through this with a<BR>
vast variety of foods that heal and help. Sometimes it's trial and error<BR>
finding the right combo and also, the system changes over time, has<BR>
different needs, so tastes will change, new foods will be tried over time.<BR>
I know that some foods agree with me more than others in the SCD circle.<BR>
Mangoes, avos, papaya, greens of all kinds, garlic, carrots, steamed cubed<BR>
beets, pineapple, mushrooms, sesame seeds, flax seed powder, chia seeds,<BR>
olive oil, grapes, persimmon, brussel sprouts, pinto  and black beans<BR>
(don't know if their both allowed), raw pistachios, peppers, eggplant,<BR>
brazil nuts, walnuts although too many will constipate me, soaked almonds<BR>
and tomatoes pureed.<BR>
Let your son guide the way on taste and follow it in the food choices<BR>
within the SCD group.<BR>

Prednisone is a very serious drug. When my doc put me on it, I read a<BR>
doctors medicinal manual that I have access to. But - I would like to<BR>
point out that I'm no doctor my self and that the side effects that I<BR>
have read about are from a total list of possible side effects. Not all<BR>
people experience any or all of the mentioned posibilities.<BR>
<BR>
This is a translation from a danish description. Please excuse any<BR>
&quot;strange language&quot;:<BR>
<BR>
Moon face (Bloating of the face, that gives a very peculiar round face),<BR>
Facial hair growth,<BR>
Osteoporosis,<BR>
Larger appetite,<BR>
Akne,<BR>
Stemmied growth (children),<BR>
Damadge to the funtions of hypothalamus, pituitary gland, <BR>
					suprarenal gland,<BR>
Euforia and/or Psychosis like symptoms,<BR>
Medicinal Pnuemonia/ broncitis,<BR>
<BR>
And actually some more which I dont understand because it's in doctors<BR>
latin.<BR>
<BR>
Personally I thought that the description of side effects was very<BR>
scarry. <BR>
<BR>
I ended up in hospital last year with a very severe case of diarrhoea<BR>
with bleeding, pain and dehydration. My doc put me on Pred. and whithin<BR>
five days all pains and D was gone. It really removes those symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately I started getting a lot of strange &quot;side effects&quot;. My doc<BR>
said that I apparently couldn't tolerate prednisone. I read the &quot;side<BR>
effects&quot; description and thought to myself that I really had to get off<BR>
of this drug again.<BR>
<BR>
But it was difficult - every time we tried to tapper off, I had a<BR>
worsening of my bowel symptoms. I still take Budsonide enigmas.<BR>
<BR>
I dont want to scare you or anyone else, especially because I'm not a<BR>
doctor and people may not have any other options than to use prednisone.<BR>
But I must also admit that prednisone scares me. I'm putting a lot of<BR>
faith in the SCD praying that it can keep me OFF pred.<BR>
<BR>
My kid would need to be seriously ill before I would think the risk was<BR>
worth it. Especially because prednisone doesn't seem to cure - it only<BR>
seems to remove the symptoms. The thought of a kid having to use<BR>
prednisone an entire life - that scares me, too.<BR>
<BR>
Best of wishes<BR>

&gt; What are the effects of prednisone on a long term basis? I know a child who<BR>
&gt; was on it, he gained a lot of weight, however, his allergies got a lot<BR>
&gt; better.  He also had a neurological/schizophrenic type disorder which<BR>
&gt; supposedly improved as well. But I wonder about his immune system and his<BR>
&gt; health, he is very young, about 4 or 5 I think, and the mom has to fly back<BR>

Hi everyone!<BR>
<BR>
When I went to my first (and last) meeting of the C&amp;CFA local chapter this<BR>
subject came up and one of the men present who has (Chrons) said that<BR>
people with Chrons and Colitis have over-active immune systems!!!! and that<BR>
is the reason &quot;we&quot; don't get flus or colds.  We all (about 9 of us) were<BR>
talking about we never get flus or colds.<BR>
<BR>
Just wanted to pass this on...have not heard this (over-active immune<BR>
system affliction) from any other source.<BR>
<BR>
Anyone else hear of this?<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I get very few colds/flu (Crohn's since 1966). Maybe 1 every few years.<BR>
&gt;I'm not around school age<BR>
&gt;children, so that probably accounts for at least part of it.<BR>

Well, I have been getting better and better...less pain, cramping, gas,<BR>
bloating, diarrhea.  So, recently, I decided to go for one of the recipes<BR>
in the book, using cooked apples.  I changed the recipe a bit.  Mixed<BR>
almond flour with butter, salt and cinnamon and put over the tart sliced,<BR>
cored apples and baked in the oven until the apples were done.  So<BR>
delicious, I can't tell you, BUT...every time I ate a helping (as a snack,<BR>
not with meals), In just a little while I started with the pain, gas,<BR>
bloating, swelling!  I stopped eating the apple crisp concoction and no<BR>
more pain, gas, bloating and swelling.  Started eating apple crisp<BR>
concoction agAin, and the same symptoms appeared.  I tried this 3 times<BR>
just to see and it was the same each time!!!  What an experiment.  Fruit<BR>
mixed with protein for me, does not work, at least at this point!!!<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;I've always believed in food combining principles, but since my<BR>
&gt;digestion has improved from being on the SCD, now I find that I can eat<BR>
&gt;proteins with fruit and don't notice any problems.  Apple and cheese<BR>
&gt;together is one of my favorite combinations.  I never would have done<BR>
&gt;this before.  So, now I don't know what to think about the theory!<BR>

Have you had small bowel problems or a small bowel resection? The last part of the small bowel<BR>
absorbs vitamin B12 (so shots are required) but also reabsorbs bile salts so that they can be <BR>
recycled. The problem is that without that portion of the small bowel, the bile salts go right on<BR>
into the large intestine and cause diarrhea. I recently had my 2nd resection (first was 30 years ago)<BR>
and the D just wasn't going away. My doctor prescribed Questran which binds up the bile salts<BR>
so that they aren't active when they get into the large intestine. Wow! What a difference. <BR>
Psyllium had helped only a little, but the Questran fixed things right up. Have only been on it<BR>
for a few days and am still working on what dosage I need, but it looks like a modest amount<BR>
in the evening is all I need.<BR>

SUBJECT:	FOOD COMBINING<BR>
<BR>
The most important word in your long fax to me is the word<BR>
&quot;perspective&quot;.  Before I go into a discussion of why &quot;Elaine has<BR>
completely ignored food combining,&quot; I want all of you interested in this<BR>
subject to think of PERSPECTIVE - the way we look at things.<BR>
<BR>
For example, before the Long Island list was formed, some of you sent me<BR>
printouts of the maelstrom discussions, and I was &quot;bursting&quot; to talk<BR>
about it but the constraints of time and the fact that no one asked for<BR>
my opinion stopped me.  It had to do with the benefits of the<BR>
Paleolithic diet (the diet of our ancestors).  It seems like no one who<BR>
was pushing this concept (which is a legitimate one) looked at the SCD<BR>
as a Paleolithic diet.  It was not developed based on our ancestor's<BR>
diet but was developed because outstanding medical doctors of the first<BR>
half of the 20th century discovered through trial and error that it<BR>
worked so well on digestive problems.  Interesting!  It just turned out<BR>
to be the foods that our ancestors adapted to.  They did not eat grains<BR>
until around the beginning of the Christian era but for millennia lived<BR>
on lean game, nuts, fruit, and some vegetables.  They probably milked<BR>
animals and soured the milk in their own way (the Masai made yogurt by<BR>
introducing the bacteria from the urine of the animal and got a yogurt<BR>
product).  But, the diet was based on the science as it was known and<BR>
mainly BECAUSE IT WORKED AND NOTHING ELSE DID!!!!  Didn't anyone realize<BR>
as the discussion went on on maelstrom that the SCD is a Paleolithic<BR>
diet?  Perspective!!!!<BR>
<BR>
FOOD COMBINING<BR>
<BR>
If you were talking to Barry Sears or Harvey Diamond and asked them the<BR>
most basic question:  WHAT IS THE GOAL OF FOOD COMBINING???, and if they<BR>
said to stay healthy or to lose weight, that would be a superficial<BR>
answer.  The goal of food combining is OPTIMAL DIGESTION - so that all<BR>
building blocks of food are digested and pass through the bowel wall<BR>
into the capillaries and then on to nourish the rest of the body.  It<BR>
assures us that only small amounts of indigestible fiber and perhaps a<BR>
little of the fat, protein and carbohydrate reaches the world of<BR>
microbes and ferments and putrifies.<BR>
<BR>
It may very well be true that if one is a strict vegetarian and consumes<BR>
large amounts of grain starch, that the rules in Fit For Life will<BR>
benefit a person.  But in my opinion, it is just compensation for the<BR>
grains not being digested thoroughly and causing the proteins and sugars<BR>
to cause problems.  You must remember that neither The Zone nor Fit For<BR>
Life is directed towards reversing these problems - digestion,<BR>
neurological, etc.<BR>
<BR>
All I know is that I read all the research that has ever been done for<BR>
almost 40 years and the hypothesis in my book is borne out by the<BR>
research.  I do not know where Harvey Diamond or Barry Sears got their<BR>
dogma except that Barry Sears may have studied the Paleolithic diet and<BR>
come to these conclusions.  <BR>
<BR>
But people are free to follow food combining the way it is stated in Fit<BR>
For Life and still stay on the SCD.  Most people who come to the SCD<BR>
have tried all these approaches, and they have not worked.  But one<BR>
should feel free to believe what they want.  If those people on the SCD<BR>
with severe ulcerative colitis are not improving after a month, it might<BR>
be worthwhile for them to combine the rules of food combining.<BR>
<BR>
I beg you to read the first few chapters of BVC again and try and<BR>
understand carbohydrate digestion.  It is extremely difficult for all<BR>
people, but almost impossible for those with some illness (remember the<BR>
damaged intestinal mucosa with the enzymes).  This is the science that I<BR>
worked so hard to grasp, but we are all different and for those who are<BR>
annoyed with me about not talking about food combining, please believe<BR>
me when I tell you that if we can conquer the digestion of starch (and<BR>
the diet does this well) then we need not worry so much about the<BR>
proteins and fats, they seem to take care of themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Love to all.<BR>

Hello,             I am fairly new to this list (abt a month) and have<BR>
followed the discussions and divisions over what this list is for and is not<BR>
for and I would offer that if someone is having trouble with the SCD<BR>
(bloating, gas, D) and is feeling frustrated or confused abt how or why this<BR>
could be , it certainly is not &quot;wax(ing) philisophically&quot; to bring up how and<BR>
in what way the diet may be modified to help that person be more successful<BR>
and get their gut healed, or at least get symptoms under control.  If that<BR>
then leads to discussions of &quot;food combining&quot; then so be it.<BR>
<BR>
I am certainly all for keeping the discussion focused on &quot;the diet&quot;, but<BR>
short of simply sharing recipes, what else is this site for if not to air our<BR>
individual experiences on it, especially since it would appear, even on my<BR>
short time in reading members' mssges, that specific responses to the diet<BR>
are highly individual, particularly in the beginning. <BR>
<BR>
 For myself, I am at a totally frustrated point, having been on SCD for<BR>
almost six weeks for IBD (no Crohn's or U.C. - yet), and have gone from an<BR>
initial response after the first 10 days of greatly reduced bloating/gas and<BR>
elimination of diarrhea to constant bloating, gas and intestinal turmoil.  I<BR>
eat winter squash in the a.m. either with egg, or with nut muffins, drink<BR>
only water, have veges and nut bread for lunch, maybe with protein and repeat<BR>
that for dinner, with usually a larger piece of protein.  I was making<BR>
yogurt, and the allowed gelatin but have since eliminated them for now.<BR>
<BR>
For the last 3 1/2-4 weeks, I've had ever-increasing gas and bloating again,<BR>
no D but very loosely formed stool and my transit time has shot up to more<BR>
than 24 hours (ie am not havg daily b.m.)  This may be good news to those<BR>
with major D, but it's very uncomfortable!  So, for me, the info on combining<BR>
has at least given me something to test myself on.  Otherwise, I'd be likely<BR>
to have abandoned the diet by now (altho to what alternative is the $mill.<BR>
question).  I have had to eliminate the yogurt, the ddcc, most fruit (for<BR>
candida treatment) and certainly all honey.  To know that perhaps I shouldn't<BR>
be eating nut bread with my squash is, while not welcome news, certainly an<BR>
opportunity to stay on the diet and see if I can get things under control<BR>
with &quot;combining&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Any thoughts on my dilemna, or my comments, would be most welcome.<BR>
Thanx,     Liz<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
I can't find anyone who sells Equalactin any where.  One healthfood store<BR>
wanted the name of the manufaturer.<BR>
<BR>
Can this product be ordered by mail?  I am eager to try it.<BR>

Sorry to hear you are not doing so well.<BR>
<BR>
Are you sure you need to eliminate fruit and honey? My longstanding yeast<BR>
problems totally went away without eliminating them. <BR>
 <BR>
Have you been checked for parasites?<BR>
<BR>
A month or two ago a prune drink was posted that Elaine recommended for<BR>
constipation. Does anyone remember what was in it? Maybe it would help<BR>
you. <BR>

Subject: Any one taking Misoprostol for IBD ?<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;9710202301.AA16960@swansong.amd.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
hi<BR>
<BR>
i have read several abstracts on PubMed that discuss the benefits<BR>
of Misoprostol, a &quot;good&quot; prostaglandin analog, in healing the<BR>
colon, one study compared it to 5-ASA (what many take for for IBD<BR>
today) and found that unlike 5-ASA, misoprostol accelerated colonic<BR>
healing.<BR>
<BR>
there were also two other drugs in the same papers, one with no name, SC-46275<BR>
 and betamethasone. SC-46275 is more potent than misoprostol, while<BR>
betamethasone seems to improve ileal fluid absorption.<BR>
<BR>
is anyone taking any of these drugs, is it even available in the US ?<BR>
