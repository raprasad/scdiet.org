&gt;&gt;&gt;Try 'copy' and 'paste'. 'Cut' erases the original document, but 'copy'<BR>
just copies it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Since I have the list 'digested', I download it on a disk, then 'copy' it<BR>
and paste it on the e-mail. My sister gave me this idea since she can't<BR>
figure out how to insert messages on someone else's e-mail message either.<BR>

Hi everyone<BR>
I've been on the diet faithfully now since October 1st. Since then however I<BR>
have had two bad flares of my reflux disease. Has anyone else had this<BR>
experience. Is it related to the diet?? Are there things I should be<BR>
avoiding/changing??<BR>
thanks<BR>

Dear Lucy, thanks very much for yr reply. I may have miscommunicated one<BR>
thing. I don't have constipation. I have a &quot;loosely&quot; formed stool, lots of<BR>
bloating/gas, and infrequent bowel movements (maybe every one and a half to<BR>
two days). I have been checked and rechecked for parasites and bacteria like<BR>
h. pylori. All are negative. One the other hand, I've been told there are so<BR>
many paras. and/or bad bacteria that doctors don't even know how to test for<BR>
them all so who knows? I may have a critter that's not been identified. I'm<BR>
willing to try combining, as well as going of the nut bread for a few days to<BR>
see if I improve. Thanks for your info and help. Liz<BR>

Moira, I have been told by me nutritionist, who supports the scd, that<BR>
enzymes are important to take if you have a depleted immune and digestive<BR>
system because one's body is not properly producing the correct levels of<BR>
enzymes to do the job, at least for the first few months. So I am going to<BR>
be taking them as soon as they arrive (I order by mail). <BR>
Secondly, I've not had constipation on the scd so I can't answer except to<BR>
say that I've been told others have had it on the scd. I'm not sure what's<BR>
&quot;legal&quot; to take for it tho'.<BR>
Lastly, I've also been told the scd will take care of candida but I think it<BR>
depends on how severe the case is. I've had very severe Candidiasis and am<BR>
taking anti-fungals (Rx), and following the diet. I was eating the allowed<BR>
honey but have since stopped except for use in making nut bread because, as<BR>
many anti-candida books say, honey just feeds yeast. I just decided to<BR>
maximize my time on anti-fungals while following the diet in other respects.<BR>
 We'll see.....Maybe if one was prepared to treat the yeast over many months<BR>
(like 6-8), instead of 3 or 4 months, just using the diet wd work fine. My<BR>
nutritionist says you can take pau d'arco and grapefruit seed extract instead<BR>
of Rx meds if you want to treat it &quot;naturally&quot;. Good luck. Liz<BR>

Hi Tina, I can't eat tomatoes so I haven't made the lasagna or used<BR>
tomatoes in my spagetti squash but, as for the squash....I usually just cook<BR>
it in the oven after seeding it, and putting it in a baking dish filled with<BR>
a bit of water, and season with s &amp; p, maybe add dried herbs, sometimes a<BR>
little olive oil. Then, when baked, I add addi'l seasoning or oils if I<BR>
want. I use it more as a baked potato substitute. Sometimes for breakfast<BR>
I'll have spag. squash and a soft-boiled egg all mixed up. It really tastes<BR>
good if you're the kind who used to love toast broken up in yr eggs! Liz<BR>

	Dear All,<BR>
 Late on this colds and flu discussion , but I think it<BR>
involves a lot of variables such as a persons age example a person that is<BR>
7 is much more apt to catch colds and flu than a person who is 45 as once<BR>
you catch one strain you develop an immunity to that particular strain.<BR>
Teachers are a prime example of this when they start out there careers they<BR>
are much more apt to catch things but by the time they are in there 50's<BR>
they have pretty much been exposed to most every thing out there. <BR>
	I myself avoided the flu last year and the rest of my family had it , but<BR>
I did have a flu shot. This fall on the other hand I have had two colds.<BR>
Both after getting my flu shot. <BR>
 Take Care,<BR>

Post Hi,I'm new to the list and received a few messages already. LIZ: Was<BR>
wondering what the name of the enzymes were that you ordered and where can you<BR>
order them?<BR>
I've had UC since May96 and started the diet in June 97 after several<BR>
attempts to get off<BR>
Prednisone. If finally worked after 10 months I was free of steroids. The<BR>
diet sure did<BR>
help! My symptoms reduced by 80% after a few days of being on the diet. Does<BR>
anyone have recommendations for making the Lois Lang bread taste good. I've<BR>
attempted the recipe several times adding cinnamon or herbs...I can't get<BR>
it to taste<BR>
good. Thanks for your help! --Annie<BR>

Do any of you who have been taking Asacol experience any skin problems (ie.<BR>
acne), or unusual diarrhea (even though following the basic diet as closely<BR>
as possible- no fruit or other vegetables)? It's been 3 weeks that I have<BR>
been taking Asacol -6 a day.<BR>

Hi Simone,<BR>
<BR>
I had a similar problem with the big D when I was on asacol. The reason<BR>
for the D was because Asacol has lactose in it and I am lactose intolerant,<BR>
are you?<BR>
<BR>
My doctor switched me to Pentasa as a result.<BR>

Good Luck!!!<BR>

<BR>
one very common problem with the the low carb zone diet is constipation, which<BR>
is similar to SCD in that respect, it's attributed to excess levels of arachidonic<BR>
acid being released by fat cells. dr. sears recommends fish oil, i personally took<BR>
10 1000mg daily to fix my constipation. the EPA in the fish oil competes for<BR>
the same enzyme that AA needs to make class 2 eicosanoids. in &quot;protein power&quot;<BR>
the dr's eades recommend fish oil in increasing quantities until the stool floats.<BR>
i was able to reduce the 10 to 2 daily, which i take instead of eating salmon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
since i eat the same meal for breakfast lunch and afternoon snack i have been<BR>
able to determine that AA in eggs and red meat really constipates still.<BR>
<BR>
you can read about AA and such in laymans terms at <BR>

by the way, dr sears recommends vitamin E with fish oil. <BR>

fish oil may solve your contstipation problem too.<BR>

Dear Pat,<BR>
 I have at least ten huge fillings , you are right on that there is<BR>
much very interesting information coming to light about these. For instance<BR>
they are banned from being used in Germany. Also free removal is guaranteed<BR>
over there. <BR>
	It is very important not to have them taken out by just anyone there is a<BR>
very detailed careful procedure that must be followed or you can get much<BR>
sicker.<BR>
	The United States American Dental association is fighting all this new<BR>
data big time.<BR>
	John Hopkins did a study on 100 Sclermadema ( I know I killed that<BR>
spelling ) patients and all 100 showed toxic levels of mercury in there<BR>
systems. <BR>
	It is on my list of things to do to improve my health. I am not saying<BR>
these make all people ill but those with weak immune systems are<BR>
particularly vulnerable to problems from amalgams.<BR>
 Take Care,<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;v01550101b0750c2edd3d@[206.40.74.48]&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Cut this out of the newdspaper this morning...attracted to it because one<BR>
quince cooked with honey has 31 g. of carbo! Haven't tried it yet, but<BR>
plan to look for quince in the store soon. I am not familiar with this<BR>
fruit but it is in season now in Northern California.<BR>
<BR>
Essentials of Quince Cokkery:<BR>
<BR>
avail mid-august thru nov, peaking in oct.<BR>
<BR>
Buying. look for pale golden-yellow fruit, sometimes tinged with green.<BR>
Even when ripe, they'll be hard, but fdon't squeeze them, because they<BR>
bruise easily.<BR>
<BR>
Storage. up to two weeks in fridge in plastic or paper bAg.<BR>
<BR>
Preparation. Wipe any fuzz briskly from quince with paper or cloth towel,<BR>
or under running water with a scrub brush.<BR>
<BR>
If the recipe calls for skin to be removed, peel with a veggie peeler.<BR>
<BR>
With a very sharp knife, carefully halve and then quarter the quince. Do<BR>
this slowly and deliberately, as the flesh is extremely hard; even experts<BR>
say it's easy to cut yourself.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, still slowly and carefully, remove the core from the quince quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Now, they're ready to cook.<BR>
<BR>
BAKED QUINCE<BR>
<BR>
Serve warm alone or topped with our &quot;jam&quot;, french creme, or with one of our<BR>
cookie recipes.<BR>
<BR>
INGREDIENTS:<BR>
<BR>
4 Med-size quinces<BR>
4 Tablespoons water<BR>
2 Tablespoons fresh lime juice<BR>
1/3 cup honey<BR>
<BR>
INSTRUCTIONS:<BR>
<BR>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Peel, quarter, and core the quinces. Place flat-side down in a glass<BR>
baking dish; add the water and lime juice. Sprinkle with the honey. Cover<BR>
with aluminum foil and bake for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours. Quinces are done<BR>
when the flesh is very tender (a butter knife will easily cut it) and they<BR>
have turned a rosy color.<BR>
<BR>
Serve warm, drizzled with the syrup from the baking dish.<BR>
<BR>
Serves 4.<BR>

Some norwegian doc's I know have cured CD in some patients simply by remove<BR>
amalgame (mercury) fillings. But this is only a very small subset of=<BR>
 patients.<BR>

Interesting survey.<BR>
<BR>
I have approximately 8 mercury amalgam fillings that I am very actively<BR>
pursuing having replaced.<BR>
<BR>
My doctor had a lot of blood work done and I have a very high amount<BR>
of mercury in my system.<BR>
<BR>
Just a side note, which may or may not have anything to do with the<BR>
amalgams,<BR>
but besides my intestinal problems, I have Fibromyalgia.<BR>

I am very interested to know how many you have dental mercury amlagams?<BR>
<BR>
How many have the newer copper amalgams?<BR>

How many have had root canals?<BR>

How many have had amalagams but have had them removed?<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
Please forgive the late response, as I have been working 10-13<BR>
hour days and have a week's worth of SCD reading to catch up on.<BR>
<BR>
I have noticed that I don't seem to get many colds/flus every<BR>
year. However I usually attributed it to taking more vitamin<BR>
&quot;C&quot; than the norm. When I do get a cold, it only seems to last<BR>
a 3-4 days.<BR>
<BR>
Now, throat infections are much harder to overcome (3 this year).<BR>
These knock me out for up to a week. Anyone else ?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Pat,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I have found the over the counter product called Equalactin to work very<BR>
&gt; well for me (It is primarily microcrystalline cellulose.) ....<BR>
<BR>
I'm surprised no one else caught this !<BR>
<BR>
Microcrystalline *cellulose* implies a complex sugar, and therefore not<BR>
permitted on the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
Although some of still require Pentasa for CD which has cellulose in it.<BR>
And others use Asacol for UC which has lactose in it. Like it says in<BR>
the book, sometimes you just don't have a choice.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the choice is always yours.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Jeff,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; thanks so much for your quick, clear and specific feedback. I greatly<BR>
&gt; appreciate it. I'm encouraged by your comments/experience. I'm also very<BR>
&gt; glad that YOU are doing so well w/ the SCD. If you don't mind, tell me,<BR>
&gt; what DID YOU EAT those first few months?!<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for the long delay.<BR>
<BR>
The beginning...<BR>
- home-made chicken soup (from book) for lunch (+L) and supper (+S)<BR>
 - I always include some DCCC just before microwaving it<BR>
	( I found this the best way to be able to eat it )<BR>
- cheesecake for breakfast (+B) +L +S<BR>
- hamburger patty with mustard +B +L (sometimes +S)<BR>
- sometimes canned tuna/salmon for +B or +L<BR>
- chicken, turkey, or fish +S<BR>
- yogurt and grape-gelatin (jello) for mid-morning, mid-afternoon snacks<BR>
	- later also include as nighttime snack<BR>
- I tried eggs and cheese, but found they caused problems. Although<BR>
 I have used eggs and honey in the cheesecake since day one.<BR>
<BR>
Introduced later...<BR>
- cookies and muffins after 1.5 - 2 months<BR>
- cooked spaghetti squash, zuchinni after 2 months<BR>
- ripe bananas after 2.5 - 3 months<BR>
- cheese after 2.5 - 3 months<BR>
- eggs after 3 - 3.5 months<BR>
<BR>
Currently... (same as the beginning except I now have)<BR>
- the soup at +L only<BR>
- the cheesecake at +L or +S, <BR>
- +B (and often +L) is a hamburger patty, 2 soft eggs, 2 slices cheddar cheese<BR>
- muffins are now made with bananas<BR>
- yogurt now includes honey with a banana mixes together<BR>
- occacionally eat cooked apples<BR>
<BR>
The muffins, cookies, grape-gelatin, and yogurt mixture I have 3 times a day<BR>
for my snacks (in between meals). So I guess you can call this food combining<BR>
since I keep the fruit stuff together. This works well for me.<BR>
<BR>
I still have not gotten around to making the nut bread, as I believe in<BR>
introducing only one new food at a time. I then judge how my body reacts to it.<BR>
<BR>
This way of eating seems bland and boring, however it is working for me. And<BR>
besides to me it's just food, no need to get fancy.<BR>
<BR>
Hope that helps. Keep with it, &quot;little steps allow you to climb the mountain&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

I'm having trouble understanding what &quot;colemas&quot; are ... it's not a word I'm<BR>

Does anyone know why this diet works for so many people, but not for<BR>
everyone? Even Elaine said in her book, and her post the other day, that if<BR>
you have severe UC, and have tried the diet for one month with no<BR>
improvement, then it probably will not work for you. I'm very<BR>
discouraged...have been on the diet for 23 days, and my bleeding, pain, gas,<BR>
constipation/diarrhea, are all worse! I eat fish, some chicken (white,<BR>
boneless, skinless), no nut bread (can't tolerate it), some homemade yogurt<BR>
(didn't really seem to set well with me), cooked veggies, peanut butter<BR>
(natural), eggs (every now and then), only acceptable cheeses (shredded),<BR>
drink water and fruit juice (unsweetened). I'm baffled, and I am getting<BR>
scoped again November 13 if the bleeding hasn't stopped. Bummer.<BR>
<BR>
I'm on 40 mg. prednisone per day, and switched from Azulfadine to 6 Asacol<BR>
per day in approximately February 1997. I do not believe the minute amount<BR>
of lactose in the Asacol is the problem, as I was never this &quot;bad&quot; before.<BR>
 The only other different thing is that I've added fish and chicken to my<BR>
diet; I was a vegetarian for six years but felt the need to get some protein<BR>
incorporated into my diet. But again, somehow I just don't feel the meat is<BR>
the problem. I guess I'm going to look into food combining next. <BR>
<BR>
If you've gotten this far, thanks for listening! Any suggestions are truly<BR>
welcome.<BR>

Hi group,<BR>
<BR>
Without any intent to offend anyone...<BR>
<BR>
I agree with Dietmar that a lot of the messages are more personal<BR>
to one person only, and these should be taken &quot;offline&quot; (mailed<BR>
to them directly). Some people go back and forth when the original<BR>
message for the group may have already been answered, and the<BR>
conversation has gone off on a tangent.<BR>
<BR>
Another pet peeve I have are the *excessive* use of replies. If you<BR>
are responding to a message which was just posted, don't bother using<BR>
reply because you want everyone to know what you are referring to.<BR>
If they just got a message from &quot;Joe&quot;, and you comment on what they<BR>
&quot;Joe&quot; said, people on this list are smart enough to know what message<BR>
you are talking about.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that the subject line (RE: blah, blah) pretty much tells<BR>
you what the topic of your response is.<BR>
<BR>
If you are responding to a specific point made by someone, only include<BR>
one or two lines as necessary. We will get the point of your response.<BR>
<BR>
If a few days have passed, then yes it could be appropriate to include<BR>
more of the original message. It's ok to hit the reply button, but please<BR>
remove the un-necessary lines.<BR>
<BR>
I get the digest version of the SCD list. Sometimes one day can have up<BR>
to 2000 lines. I forward them to myself and strip out the useless reply<BR>
lines. This new message I received is often 25-50% smaller in length.<BR>
<BR>
I am not upset at anyone, this has just been annoying for a vey long time.<BR>
I hope newer computer users will learn the accepted protocol.<BR>
<BR>
Usually you include the couple of lines of the original message preceded<BR>
with &quot;&gt; &quot; and then your message. For example...<BR>
<BR>
----	example 1<BR>
Hi Joe,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I discovered a great recipe last night<BR>
<BR>
What was it ?<BR>
Paul<BR>
----<BR>
 OR<BR>
----	example 2<BR>
Hi Joe,<BR>
<BR>
What great recipe was that ?<BR>
Paul<BR>
----<BR>
<BR>
Notice how example 2 never needed the original message :) My 2 cents.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, if this sounds petty to some. Perhaps I've just been working too<BR>
hard (long hours) and I am a bit cranky.<BR>
<BR>

A new Crohn's diagnosee - one month now. But this was after two months of<BR>
diarrhea, a colonoscopy, thus the diagnosis. I've read the SCD list with<BR>
enormous interest, because I've had no pain, never did, but have been on<BR>
Asacol (six daily) for one month and cut out all dairy products and<BR>
chocolate. Using ghee (clarified butter) now and also have no gluten<BR>
problems, have been eating collard greens, kale, broccoli, beans and eggs<BR>
and wheat products, honey, popcorn rice cakes, grits and even dared a<BR>
zucchini muffin recipe that used brown sugar! Now I learn Asacol had<BR>
lactose!<BR>
<BR>
From this I am beginning to believe that I don't have Crohn's, despite my <BR>
doctor's diagnosis (his reputation is super-stellar) which was UC but after<BR>
tests he called to say it was Crohns. Before I confront him with this on<BR>
Nov.4, I would like to hear from some of you about the following:<BR>
<BR>
1. How many of you with UC and CD have had periodontal problems and how<BR>
severe? I have recently read somewhere about gum disease and colon<BR>
problems.<BR>
<BR>
2. How many of you have cats, dogs, birds or other animals? There is a<BR>
reason for this question: Two weeks after obtaining a puppy in July, the<BR>
diarrhea started - pup had been diagnosed first with coccidia (a parasite)<BR>
and immediately after, with giardia (usually from a bad water source). Vet<BR>
thought I had giardia from pup. Stool tested, no parasites, colonoscopy<BR>
then ordered. This is just so coincidental because I have never had this<BR>
problem and am not experiencing the problems I reas about on this list. I<BR>
WAS diagnosed in January with diabetes, went on a diet and lost 40 pounds<BR>
and blood sugar has never been over 119 since. The diet for diabetes and<BR>
the SCD or CD diets are at dagger points with each other. I do not connect<BR>
my weight loss with Crohns, because I strenuously dieted, to LOSE THIS<BR>
WEIGHT, cutting out all meats except chicken and salmon, no butter, cheese<BR>
or animal fats, and it wasn't easy., but lived on good salads, crudities,<BR>
all veggies, peanut butter and popcorn rice cakes.<BR>
<BR>
The mention of parasites in the SCD list today caused me to finally write.<BR>
I have the book and am ready and willing to use the SCD diet at any moment.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, since the medical world has discovered what causes stomach ulcers,<BR>
why hasn't this discovery been related to colon problems? I think all SCd<BR>
people have made this connection, but has the medical world? Sorry for the<BR>
length, will not write this much again, but will so appreciate replies. We<BR>
have to find answers about cause and cure and I am researching like mad.<BR>

Dan, <BR>
<BR>
thx for pointing this out. I thought though that cellulose is the<BR>
undigestible part of vegetables etc. and is simply a fiber/bulking<BR>
agent, not a sugar as the &quot;lose&quot; would certainly imply. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I only used it for about 10 days and it got my D under control<BR>
and then was able to quit and use psyllium as I usually do. Psyllium<BR>
though did not work for me when I was having bad D, it only seemed to<BR>
make things work better once I got the D under control.<BR>

&gt; Hi Pat,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; I have found the over the counter product called Equalactin to work<BR>
&gt; very<BR>
&gt; &gt; well for me (It is primarily microcrystalline cellulose.) ....<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I'm surprised no one else caught this !<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Microcrystalline *cellulose* implies a complex sugar, and therefore<BR>
&gt; not<BR>
&gt; permitted on the SCD.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Although some of still require Pentasa for CD which has cellulose in<BR>
&gt; it.<BR>
&gt; And others use Asacol for UC which has lactose in it. Like it says in<BR>
&gt; the book, sometimes you just don't have a choice.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Nonetheless, the choice is always yours.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Dear Deanna,<BR>
I'm sorry to hear you haven't been responding to the diet. <BR>
<BR>
I noticed peanut butter on the list of foods you are eating. I have<BR>
found that it can cause bloating, etc. Personally, I would avoid it <BR>
during the beginning stages.<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the diet for 4 years, and there are 2 foods that I have <BR>
to be very careful with: peanut butter and beans. For the most part <BR>
I avoid them.<BR>
<BR>
Lucy<BR>
<BR>
PS. The other thing I would go easy on is fruit juices. Are you buying <BR>
commercial juices? You might reread what Elaine says about them in <BR>
the book.<BR>

&gt;isnt an overactive immune system tied in with AUTOIMMUNE problems? in other<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Only if there is an outside (i.e. coming from outside the body) factor<BR>
(such as a bacteria, or, more specifically, a protein segment of a<BR>
bacteria's coat or DNA or whatever) that enters the body, is an irritant to<BR>
the body so that the body cranks up its defense systems, and if this &quot;alarm<BR>
trigger&quot; is SIMILAR to some body component so that the body attacks not<BR>
only the &quot;outside insult&quot; but also its (deceptively similar) own parts.<BR>
<BR>
So just because your immune system is &quot;hyper&quot; active (maybe some folks are<BR>
simply &quot;tuned to be more high-powered&quot;?) doesn't mean it'll start<BR>
attacking its own tissues. <BR>
<BR>
Things are not always so simple in biological systems ... one wishes they<BR>
WERE as simple as pie, but if that were the case we'd all be healthy as<BR>

Would be nice if we could get some more replies but so far 9 out of 9<BR>
replied that they have mercury amalgam fillings and several have<BR>
additional root canals. <BR>
<BR>
I have just finished reading a book called &quot;It's All in Your Head&quot; by<BR>
Dr. Hal Huggins. It is very intriguing and quite convincing that<BR>
mercury is not something we should have in our mouths or body. In fact,<BR>
overwhelmingly convincing. This Dentist has been at the forefront of<BR>
studying the affects of Mercury Amalgams on the entire body including<BR>
the GI tract. And he has paid a dear price for it from other dentists<BR>
and the ADA. Why are these associations so closed minded? Money,<BR>
inertia and the fear of being shown that they are wrong it seems. Very<BR>
similar to the typical response Elaine gets from the various GI<BR>
associations.<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, he also gets into Blood Chemisty tests and shows what<BR>
happens to peoples Blood chemistry when they have their amalgams removed<BR>
using the correct extraction protocal that he has painstaking learned<BR>
through trial and error over the past 25+ years. I have never learned<BR>
so much useful info from any other book I have ever read. He also<BR>
recommends to his mercury toxic patients a diet that is amazingly close<BR>
to SCD. <BR>
<BR>
I can highly recommend this book as being both an interesting read and<BR>
extremely informative. It can be gotten through Amazon.com or his own<BR>
web site hugnet.com. You decide whether or not this could be a<BR>
significant issue for you and for other people trying to recover from<BR>
lots of different things, especially auto-immune kind of diseases.<BR>
Enjoy!<BR>

&gt;	Dear Dietmar,<BR>
&gt; But last year it prevented me from getting a very nasty<BR>
&gt;flu. So I think it is a toss up. <BR>
&gt; Take Care,<BR>
&gt; Kay<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
OK, so that's your conclusion. That was the point of the survey: to find<BR>
the facts.<BR>
<BR>
Hoever, if we leave out all the people who have a stake in pushing flu<BR>
shots (i.e. the doctors &amp; companies &amp; bureaucracies in the<BR>
medical-industrial complex who make money off having you say &quot;yes&quot;), there<BR>
appears to be a concensus amongst medically-trained people, (and even among<BR>
fully &quot;orthodox&quot; physicians OUTSIDE Canada &amp; the US) that flu shots in fact<BR>
WEAKEN your body's defense systems &amp; that taking them develops a life-long<BR>
reliance on them by the body. <BR>
<BR>
Isn't that what all drug companies &amp; paid practitioners want? The ideal<BR>
&quot;drug&quot; is one that keeps the patient hooked all their life!<BR>
<BR>
If you have contacts in medical circles in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, or<BR>
other continental European countries, you might be surprised to discover<BR>
that they don't buy into this American-style &quot;flu shot&quot; or &quot;give 'em a shot<BR>
for every illness coming down the pike&quot; method of medicinal &quot;care&quot;. But,<BR>
hey, it's your body. And, sure, if it seems to work great, people always<BR>
love that kind of &quot;pill&quot; ... when prednisone or the polio vaccines first<BR>
came out, they too were the greaest thing since sliced bread; the real<BR>
story of how they fucked up the body only trundled along a few decades later.<BR>

&gt;Does anyone know why this diet works for so many people, but not for<BR>
&gt;everyone? Even Elaine said in her book, and her post the other day, that<BR>
if<BR>
&gt;you have severe UC, and have tried the diet for one month with no<BR>
&gt;improvement, then it probably will not work for you. I'm very<BR>
&gt;discouraged...have been on the diet for 23 days, and my bleeding, pain,<BR>
gas,<BR>
&gt;constipation/diarrhea, are all worse! I eat fish, some chicken (white,<BR>
&gt;boneless, skinless), no nut bread (can't tolerate it), some homemade yogurt<BR>
&gt;(didn't really seem to set well with me), cooked veggies, peanut butter<BR>
&gt;(natural), eggs (every now and then), only acceptable cheeses (shredded),<BR>
&gt;drink water and fruit juice (unsweetened). I'm baffled, and I am getting<BR>
&gt;scoped again November 13 if the bleeding hasn't stopped. Bummer.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm on 40 mg. prednisone per day, and switched from Azulfadine to 6 Asacol<BR>
&gt;per day in approximately February 1997. I do not believe the minute amount<BR>
&gt;of lactose in the Asacol is the problem, as I was never this &quot;bad&quot; before.<BR>
&gt; The only other different thing is that I've added fish and chicken to my<BR>
&gt;diet; I was a vegetarian for six years but felt the need to get some<BR>
protein<BR>
&gt;incorporated into my diet. But again, somehow I just don't feel the meat<BR>
is<BR>
&gt;the problem. I guess I'm going to look into food combining next.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;If you've gotten this far, thanks for listening! Any suggestions are truly<BR>
&gt;welcome.<BR>

 Hi Deanna :<BR>
<BR>
How can you be sure there is no sugar in either the peanut butter or the<BR>
juices if you did not make them yourself?<BR>
DO NOT TRUST LABELS EVER untill you are in some state of remission. To<BR>
trust a label at the beginning of the diet is extremely dangerous.<BR>
<BR>
Hope you can find the answers to better health.<BR>

It boils down to if a bacteria is causing stomach inflammation and<BR>
ulcers, why should it be such a leap of faith to think that a bacteria<BR>
could be doing the same thing in the intestines?<BR>
 <BR>
Possibly what the SCD does is keep the bad bacteria under control, <BR>
which would expain why so many people end up right where they started<BR>
if they go back to eating the way they used to. Hopefully someone is<BR>
working on finding the bacteria that might be causing IBD. A 2 week<BR>

Yep; except I'm not ... I said (if I remember correctly) something to the<BR>

medicine is practiced, so to take it with a grain of salt &amp; not to think<BR>
there aren't other ways of doing things, but in the end YOU have to decide. <BR>
<BR>

the sugar content, although the peanut butter is pretty obvious due to the<BR>
difference in taste and texture from &quot;regular&quot; peanut butter, and the fact I<BR>
buy it at a health food store specializing in a lot of no sugar type stuff<BR>
makes me pretty confident it is acceptable. <BR>
<BR>
As for the fruit juice, the two I've been drinking are Dole, unsweetened<BR>
pineapple juice, and orange juice (although I've pretty much cut out<BR>
OJ...hurts almost immediately after drinking). I think I'll follow up with<BR>
the makers on the sugar content as Elaine suggests. But, I still don't<BR>
understand why I am worse. You think all the stuff I have cut out would be<BR>
helping, at least somewhat. <BR>
<BR>
Sorry if I sound so negative--working on my attitude! :)<BR>

I have many mercury fillings and 2 root canals. So that makes it 10 of 10. Haven't looked into<BR>

watch out for health food stores, Whole Foods told me that all their<BR>
beef was range fed, when i asked why the beef fat didn't have a yellowish<BR>
tint (white fat means corn fed) the butcher quickly responded that it<BR>
wasn't all range fed, and then he said it was only free of anti-biotics<BR>
and hormones. in another instance their bulk protein powder was (is still) labeled<BR>
as two tablespoons equals 25g of protein, i bought an accurate scale and<BR>
measured two level tablespoons at about 18 g, no way it there could<BR>
be 25g of protein in 18 g of protein powder, it took three heaping tablespoons<BR>
to get 25g of protein in 28g of powder. the store manager weighed this out for<BR>
himself and agreed that the bin label was wrong.<BR>

&gt; OK, so that's your conclusion. That was the point of the survey: to find<BR>

&gt; <BR>
&gt; Hoever, if we leave out all the people who have a stake in pushing flu<BR>
&gt; shots (i.e. the doctors &amp; companies &amp; bureaucracies in the<BR>
&gt; medical-industrial complex who make money off having you say &quot;yes&quot;),<BR>
there<BR>
&gt; appears to be a concensus amongst medically-trained people, (and even<BR>
among<BR>
&gt; fully &quot;orthodox&quot; physicians OUTSIDE Canada &amp; the US) that flu shots in<BR>
fact<BR>
&gt; WEAKEN your body's defense systems &amp; that taking them develops a<BR>
life-long<BR>
&gt; reliance on them by the body. <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Isn't that what all drug companies &amp; paid practitioners want? The ideal<BR>
&gt; &quot;drug&quot; is one that keeps the patient hooked all their life!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; If you have contacts in medical circles in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland,<BR>
or<BR>
&gt; other continental European countries, you might be surprised to discover<BR>
&gt; that they don't buy into this American-style &quot;flu shot&quot; or &quot;give 'em a<BR>
shot<BR>
&gt; for every illness coming down the pike&quot; method of medicinal &quot;care&quot;. But,<BR>
&gt; hey, it's your body. And, sure, if it seems to work great, people always<BR>
&gt; love that kind of &quot;pill&quot; ... when prednisone or the polio vaccines first<BR>
&gt; came out, they too were the greaest thing since sliced bread; the real<BR>

&gt; I bought some blueberries at Whole Foods last night(dried) and made your<BR>

&gt; sucrose which isn't allowed on the SCD diet. Correct me if I am wrong. I<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;199710241756.MAA24747@b01d04.exu.ericsson.se&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi, I've just received my first 25-lb shipment of almond<BR>
flour and am wondering how to store it. I want to put it<BR>
in the freezer. I can fit in the whole box as is, but<BR>
wonder how easy it would be to scoop out 3 cups at a time <BR>
for a recipe if it's been frozen. I could put it in individual<BR>
plastic bags, but don't want to really do that if I can easily<BR>
scoop out the frozen stuff.<BR>
<BR>
What have others done?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks so much,<BR>

I've been on the diet almost 3 months and just recently determined that I<BR>
was intolerant of nut flour. As for unsweetened juices, I can only drink<BR>
unsweetened pineapple juice, but only about one glass full a day. I can't<BR>
drink any other unsweetened juices even when they are diluted. Some of the<BR>
people in this group say they can tolerate the juices if they are diluted 1<BR>
to 1 with water. You might try that.<BR>
<BR>
I've been on asulfidine for years with no ill effects, but twice I tried<BR>
going on asacol and all-### broke loose each time. Although there isn't much<BR>
lactose in asacol, it really does a number on me.<BR>
<BR>
For vegetables, I can only eat broccoli; the others create problems for me.<BR>
I'm also able to eat all meats with no problem. Peanut butter gives me a bad<BR>
case of gas.<BR>
<BR>
Although my diet is very limited (more so than what Breaking the Viscous<BR>
Cycle calls for), I've found the combination that works for me. My gut has<BR>
been in great shape for the last two weeks. The foods I just mentioned may<BR>
be causing your continued problems.<BR>
<BR>
It might help for you to go to the bare basics mentioned in the book for a<BR>
while. If this helps start adding one different allowable food at a time to<BR>
see how you react to it. Then go for at least three days without adding<BR>
other different foods.<BR>
<BR>
It may take awhile to find out what combination works for you, but once you<BR>
find it, life will become more bearable. It's rough being your own test<BR>
subject, but you don't really have any other alternatives. Don't give up on<BR>
the SCD too quickly. I found that this diet was worth sticking to even<BR>
though it took sometime for me to find what worked for me.<BR>

&gt;Does anyone know why this diet works for so many people, but not for<BR>
&gt;everyone? Even Elaine said in her book, and her post the other day, that<BR>
if<BR>
&gt;you have severe UC, and have tried the diet for one month with no<BR>
&gt;improvement, then it probably will not work for you. I'm very<BR>
&gt;discouraged...have been on the diet for 23 days, and my bleeding, pain,<BR>
gas,<BR>
&gt;constipation/diarrhea, are all worse! I eat fish, some chicken (white,<BR>
&gt;boneless, skinless), no nut bread (can't tolerate it), some homemade yogurt<BR>
&gt;(didn't really seem to set well with me), cooked veggies, peanut butter<BR>
&gt;(natural), eggs (every now and then), only acceptable cheeses (shredded),<BR>
&gt;drink water and fruit juice (unsweetened). I'm baffled, and I am getting<BR>
&gt;scoped again November 13 if the bleeding hasn't stopped. Bummer.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm on 40 mg. prednisone per day, and switched from Azulfadine to 6 Asacol<BR>
&gt;per day in approximately February 1997. I do not believe the minute amount<BR>
&gt;of lactose in the Asacol is the problem, as I was never this &quot;bad&quot; before.<BR>
&gt; The only other different thing is that I've added fish and chicken to my<BR>
&gt;diet; I was a vegetarian for six years but felt the need to get some<BR>
protein<BR>
&gt;incorporated into my diet. But again, somehow I just don't feel the meat<BR>
is<BR>
&gt;the problem. I guess I'm going to look into food combining next.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;If you've gotten this far, thanks for listening! Any suggestions are truly<BR>

Hi Liz,<BR>
What works for me is to bag up the flour in gallon size freezer<BR>
bags. It seems like you end up with about 6 bags. Keep one bag <BR>
in the refrigerator and the rest in the freezer. As soon as you are<BR>
running low, bring another bag down from the freezer.<BR>

Mix eggs with the honey. Add the vanilla and salt. Mix well. Gradually=<BR>
<BR>
add<BR>
the almond flour. Mix well. Blend in the blueberries and lemon rind.<BR>
 Finally add the baking soda*. Fill muffin cups about 1/2 full. Bake at=<BR>
<BR>
350<BR>
for about 20 minutes. Makes 1 dozen muffins. About 220 calories, 15g<BR>
carbohydrate, and 75 mg calcium in each muffin.<BR>
<BR>
I add the baking soda last because it begins to react immediately when<BR>
mixed<BR>
with wet ingredients. It's rising power is a timed reaction. (Baking<BR>
powder<BR>
rises twice--first it reacts with wet ingredients and then it has a risin=<BR>
g<BR>
reaction to heat. We don't have the advantage of two reactions when usin=<BR>
g<BR>
only baking soda.)<BR>

FYI<BR>
<BR>
it appears that UC sufferers are mostly non-smokers, has anyone tried nicotine gum or transdermal<BR>
patches. according to one study the nicotine and predisone act the same way, with nicotine<BR>
be about 50% effective compared to predisone. i dont know where MD's are on this, but<BR>
it may be a choice between UC and nicotine for maintaining remission. there are about<BR>
57 articles on PubMed that discuss the use of nicotine in various colitis applications,<BR>
either as a patch/gum/enema, with and without the use of 5-ASA drugs. it is interesting.<BR>

Smoking sometimes seems effective for my colitis. My last ND wasn't too<BR>
thrilled about the patch idea, but he was willing to perscribe it for me<BR>
(this was before it was OTC). His experience with patients was that it<BR>
wasn't very effective. <BR>
