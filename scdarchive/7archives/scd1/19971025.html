Hi Rachel -- everyone else too I guess, I'd originally intended to mail<BR>
this post directly to you, Rachel, but it appears I sent it to the<BR>
entire list :) --<BR>
<BR>
About the dosages for the magnesium and malic acid for fibromyalgia, it<BR>
depends on what brand of supplements you take. The ones I have, I take<BR>
three pills a night before going to bed. This roughly amounts to the<BR>
higher dose that is quoted here.<BR>
&gt;300 - 600 mg. magnesium<BR>
&gt;1200 - 1400 mg. malic acid<BR>
<BR>
By the way, the other thing I am currently taking is supplements of the<BR>
amino acid, ornithine. It's supposed to boost human growth hormone<BR>
production, which can help in stimulating the body's immune response. <BR>
It's also supposed to help metabolize extra ammonia, which tends to be<BR>
produced by the bad bacteria we tend to have if our bowels are out of<BR>
whack. That's just an FYI.<BR>

&gt;Let's not blast each other over the net.<BR>

I'll agree with that, EXCEPT if someone attacks me in public, I consider it<BR>
fair to retaliate by the same avenue. When I originally replied to the flu<BR>
shot item, I didn't have the intention to launch a specifically-targeted<BR>
PERSONAL &quot;attack&quot;, I sent the response publically because I felt another<BR>
perspective needed to be publically aired.<BR>
<BR>
As of now, I'm not going to respond to any more correspondence, public or<BR>
private, on this topic ... someone else is welcome to get their ass shot<BR>
off from the hyper-sensitives whining about imaginary injustices.<BR>

Once again, thanks for your response, and again for your accurate and<BR>
clear ,answer.<BR>
I'm one month into this &quot;thing&quot; and find ups and downs,probably like<BR>
most of us.<BR>
<BR>
Last 3 days doing much better. Did 2 different things that I am aware<BR>
of. 1-stopped nuts and nut flour breads, and 2-added homemade yogurt.<BR>
<BR>
However, sometimes I wonder if our ups and downs are purely/mostly a<BR>
function of the 'healing process' and that perhaps, has little to do<BR>
with what we eat; that maybe we attribute &quot;the last food eaten&quot; to be<BR>
the offending/objectionable food. I think we may do this more than we<BR>
realize. Do we know for example, how long it takes for an offending to<BR>
affect us negatively&quot; i.e. couldn't yesterday's chicken for lunch cause<BR>
problems for us today, and NOT the nut flour we had for breakfast today?<BR>
<BR>
Yes, there are foods most of us wouls swear caused us grief;I don't<BR>
doubt that.<BR>
But, maybe there are other times we are just guessing, or wanting to<BR>
believe or not believe in a given food at a given time.<BR>

I agree with you entirely. I also just started the diet and have come to the<BR>
conclusion that if I follow it 100%, I'm going to stop trying to analyze &quot;ups<BR>
and downs&quot; to the last food eaten. Well, I do admit I think fruit juices,<BR>
even welch's grape cut in half, is a problem. Oh well, I'm trying! Take<BR>
care, Jane<BR>

Dan, <BR>
All I know how to do is read a message and if there is something I want to<BR>
say about that message - I hit reply, type my message, then hit send. I do<BR>
not see how to cut and paste ( I've only done that when word processing). I<BR>
also don't understand the part about including, or not including, a piece of<BR>
a message that I'm responding too. Sorry I'm so computer illiterate, but I<BR>
like participating and want to do it correctly. I'm on AOL if that makes a<BR>
difference. Maybe someone could send me &quot;baby step&quot; directions. Thank-you,<BR>
Jane<BR>
P.S. I'll save the directions for the next idot who comes along. That way<BR>
this group will have SOP for correct computer response!<BR>

<BR>
Ok, we already know that AOL mail sucks. <BR>
<BR>
I don't use that awful service for mail. But I do have it for other stuff.<BR>
 I have version 3.0 for windows 95. See the &quot;Help-About American Online&quot;<BR>
menu selection to check your version.<BR>
<BR>
To reply without including anything: hit reply.<BR>
To include a portion of the message you are replying to:<BR>
<BR>
1. Move the cursor to the begining of the passage you want to quote.<BR>
2. Hold down the shift key and use the down arrow to &quot;highlight&quot; what you<BR>
want to quote.<BR>
----or----<BR>
Press CTRL-A -- this highlights the whole damn message<BR>
3. Press reply. Now everthing that is highlighted will be in the new<BR>
message.<BR>
4. Now edit the e-mail -- use the technique in #2 and press delete to<BR>
delete large portions of text -- especially if the message you are replying<BR>
to is very large. <BR>
5. Type your reply anywhere you want to in the body of the message.<BR>
6. Check your &quot;To:&quot; line -- are you sending to the correct people -- is it<BR>
a personal message and the list address is in there. Just click on it and<BR>
use arrow keys to delete the extra address or type in the address that you<BR>
want.<BR>
<BR>
So far every time I've wanted to cut or copy and paste I've been able to do<BR>
it. AOL stinks but you can absolutively posilutely use cut/copy/paste. <BR>
However, when highlighting stuff in the original message, you can only<BR>
copy, not cut -- in the edit menu, only copy is enabled, cut is not<BR>
enabled.<BR>
<BR>
Keys -- or use the edit menu:<BR>
<BR>
Copy	Ctrl-C<BR>
Cut	Ctrl-X<BR>
Paste	Ctrl-V<BR>
Highlight All	Ctrl-A<BR>

I think this is very good observation. I think often we are guessing<BR>
and blaming our distress on the last thing we ate when it may not have<BR>
been that at all. That's what makes this so much fun :-(<BR>
<BR>
Also, with myself when I have a major flare up, I fire a lot of<BR>
different kinds of &quot;bullets&quot; and I I can tell that I am hitting<BR>
something. The problem is knowing which bullets hit and which ones<BR>
missed entirely. Those of us with a more patient personality probably<BR>
do better identifying what really helps and what does not, through slow<BR>
patient observation etc. I wish I was more like that. <BR>
<BR>
Give me a machine gun so I can fire more bullets! I am learning though!<BR>

Hi Deanna<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I eat .... peanut butter (natural), eggs (every now and then),<BR>
&gt; only acceptable cheeses (shredded), ... and fruit juice (unsweetened).<BR>
<BR>
Dont' be discouraged just yet, everyone prgresses at a different<BR>
rate ...&quot;your mileage may vary&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Peanut butter should wait until later.<BR>
<BR>
As mentioned in one of my earlier posts, I found eggs and cheese<BR>
to be a problem in the beginning. I was able to re-introduce them<BR>
after 3 months. Eggs seemed ok in recipes at the beginning.<BR>
<BR>
I use Welch's grape juice and had no problem with IF I duluted it<BR>
with an equal amount of water. As well, try making the &quot;Jello&quot;<BR>
with unflavored gelatin.<BR>

Well said Glenn.<BR>
<BR>
Although I am going to say this for list....<BR>
Dietmar, and anyone else, who feels the need to use<BR>
inappropriate language, your opinion means nothing when<BR>
you can't express yourself without using offensive words.<BR>
I am sure may others feel this way.<BR>
<BR>
Sure I occasionally use such words in private, however<BR>
I don't use them at inappropriate places. And this *support*<BR>
list is such a place. There are parents on this list who<BR>
have kids with IBD, and I am sure they would like to be able<BR>
to let their kids read messages from this list, without<BR>
needing to censor things.<BR>
<BR>
It's always a good thing to read over your own message<BR>
before sending it out.<BR>
<BR>

As far as I understand, no ... the fermentation of the milk sugar changes<BR>
its characteristics, so (from personal experience) it stays good for at<BR>
least 1 month inthe fridge (we make it by the gallon bucket, so that takes<BR>
some time to get used up, and have never had a spoilage problem).<BR>

Hi Jeff -<BR>
<BR>
i agree wholeheartedly. no sense in trying to figure out if something you ate<BR>
gave you a reaction. there is so much going on at one time i think alot of it<BR>
is cleansing. at least this is what i have found. <BR>
<BR>
your welcome for the yogurt tips.<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;01BCE192.03040080@max7-24.ghg.net&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I have really enjoyed the recipes that are posted so I thought I would =<BR>
add one I just found. It is from a book called &quot;Fast and Delicious =<BR>
Cookbook&quot; by Rose Grant:<BR>
<BR>
Swiss Sole Roll-up<BR>
<BR>
2 lbs sole or flounder (6 fillets)<BR>
salt and pepper<BR>
1/2 tsp each tarragon and dill<BR>
6 slices of swiss cheese<BR>
8 oz tomato-mushroom sauce<BR>
Parmesan cheese<BR>
<BR>
Season fillets with salt and pepper, tarragon and dill. Place slice of =<BR>
cheese on fillet and roll up. Place seam side down in buttered baking =<BR>
dish just large enough to hold fish (the rolls should be packed tightly =<BR>
together). Top with tomato sauce. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. =<BR>
Do not overcook. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and bake 3 minutes =<BR>
longer. Serves 6. =20<BR>
<BR>
This is a really quick recipe and very tasty. I didn't have either =<BR>
tarragon or dill so I used thyme. Also, the recipe calls for =<BR>
tomato-mushroom sauce, but I just used tomato juice. I am sure you =<BR>
could make your own thicker, tomato- mushroom sauce from the juice.<BR>
<BR>
Second subject: Pumpkin season!! I highly recommend the pumpkin =<BR>
cookies and the pumpkin pie recipes in the Book. I actually got a =<BR>
pumpkin from the store and cooked it and made my own mashed pumpkin. It =<BR>
really wasn't that hard. The pumpkin cookies are very light and =<BR>
delicious. The pie recipe is good (if you don't mind eating it without =<BR>
crust or a spoonful or CoolWhip). At first the seasonings tasted very =<BR>
strong, but after the pie was refrigerated for a day, all the flavors =<BR>
seemed to mellow a bit. So for a bit of variety try some pumpkin =<BR>
recipes while the pumpkins are plentiful. =20<BR>

My incidence of colds and flus is about the same now as it was before I was<BR>
diagnosed with IBD-- one in the fall, one in the spring; sometimes I luck<BR>
out and miss one. I haven't had the flu since the Hong Kong flu around<BR>
1969; I've been getting flu shots for the last 5 years (I work with a high<BR>
risk population); been an IBD-er for about 3 years.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I wouldn't waste my time theorizing with such a small sample -- a<BR>
handful of respondents out of thousands with IBD. Concluding, even<BR>
tentatively, that &quot;it appears&quot; that we get less colds and flus than the<BR>
general population is way premature! (&lt;&lt;if (as it appears) IBD'ers have<BR>
the ability to decrease / prevent getting colds &amp; flues&gt;&gt;) For more<BR>
responses, why not try the IBD list, and the CCFA forum?<BR>

Hi Jeff, Jane and Pat,<BR>

Jeff wrote...<BR>
&gt; However, sometimes I wonder if our ups and downs are purely/mostly a<BR>
&gt; function of the 'healing process' and that perhaps, has little to do<BR>
&gt; with what we eat; that maybe we attribute &quot;the last food eaten&quot; to be<BR>
&gt; the offending/objectionable food.<BR>
<BR>
Jane wrote...<BR>
&gt; I agree with you entirely. I also just started the diet and have come<BR>
&gt; to the conclusion that if I follow it 100%, I'm going to stop trying<BR>
&gt; to analyze &quot;ups and downs&quot; to the last food eaten.<BR>
<BR>
Pat wrote...<BR>
&gt; I think this is very good observation. I think often we are guessing<BR>
&gt; and blaming our distress on the last thing we ate when it may not have<BR>
&gt; been that at all. That's what makes this so much fun :-(<BR>
<BR>
You are all correct. I also believe (as I have mentioned on this list)<BR>
that even when following the diet 100%, offending foods can be found<BR>
by only introducing one new food at a time. If you stick to the same<BR>
foods, doing well with them, introduce a new food for 1-3 days, you<BR>
will notice if there is a difference ...positive or negative.<BR>
<BR>
This is why I have taken a long time to vary what I am eating (as my<BR>
previous message to Jeff showed). And why I have said that eggs and<BR>
cheese did not do well in the beginning, however after getting better<BR>
on the diet, they were successfully introduced after 3 months. I can<BR>
now enjoy them daily.<BR>
<BR>
This is my experience on the matter. Hope it helps...<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Jane (and any other new people ...)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; All I know how to do is read a message and if there is something I want to<BR>
&gt; say about that message - I hit reply, type my message, then hit send.<BR>
<BR>
That's fine. You can then delete the lines which are not necessary.<BR>
Either pointing your mouse to the end of where you want to delete and<BR>
continously press 'backspace' key...not recommended, very slow.<BR>
Or as Bill said...<BR>
&gt;&gt; 1. Move the cursor to the begining of the passage you want to quote.<BR>
&gt;&gt; 2. Hold down the shift key and use the down arrow to &quot;highlight&quot;<BR>
&gt;&gt; what you want to quote.<BR>
<BR>
Bill also mentions &quot;hot&quot; keys for cut and paste.<BR>
&gt;&gt; Keys -- or use the edit menu:<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Copy		Ctrl-C<BR>
&gt;&gt; Cut		Ctrl-X<BR>
&gt;&gt; Paste	Ctrl-V<BR>
<BR>
I find that most all windows programs also accept the following,<BR>
which I find these easier to remember.<BR>
	Copy	Ctrl-Insert<BR>
	Paste	Shift-Insert<BR>
	Cut	Shift-Delete<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Sorry I'm so computer illiterate, ...<BR>
<BR>
Don't worry about it, we all had to start sometime. My message was<BR>
not intended to make anyone feel illiterate, simply to help<BR>
understand. In a few months I am sure you will have the hang of this<BR>
&quot;computer stuff&quot;, and be teaching others how to do it ;)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Maybe someone could send me &quot;baby step&quot; directions. Thank-you,<BR>
<BR>
If you (or anyone else) need more on this subject, email me directly.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

P.S. Thanks Bill for your response to help Jane.<BR>

<BR>
I guess &quot;not THAT much&quot; is a relative term, relative to how healthy one is. <BR>
If his stool is truly orange, not yellow-ish, well, there are no other<BR>
sources I can think of for that colour, and the body does not produce that<BR>
colour as far as I know. So that leaves ...?<BR>
<BR>
In my own experience, juicing is tricky: are you diluting it at least half<BR>
with clean water? Juice &quot;straight up&quot; is too harsh &amp; concentrated for the<BR>
system to handle, esp. when one has active IBD. <BR>
<BR>
And are you using ice or very-cold water from the fridge? Don't!<BR>
<BR>
You might want to switch to making carrot soup insted of juicing: it's warm<BR>
(which is better on the system), and it will have the fibre instead of<BR>
being stripped-down &amp; dumping a lot of pure, concentrated carbo's into the<BR>
system.<BR>

Apple. But I'd really, honestly, not make juicing a great part of the SCD<BR>
program. Better to eat them cooked &amp; pureed, esp. at the start.<BR>

&gt;VIRUS WARNING!!! VIRUS WARNING!!! VIRUS WARNING!!! VIRUS WARNING!!!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Dear Internet user,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;It seems that the destructive minds who like to invent computer viruses<BR>
&gt;have<BR>
&gt;struck again. A new virus, popularly known as INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0, has<BR>
&gt;been propogating the Net for several weeks now. MILLIONS of computers have<BR>
&gt;been infected by this insidious virus (mostly PCs, and a few Macintoshes as<BR>
&gt;well.) This virus is one of the MOST DANGEROUS yet unleashed on the<BR>
&gt;computing<BR>
&gt;public!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0 is known to have the following horrible effects on<BR>
&gt;infected computers:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It WASTES an incredible amount of HARD DISK SPACE, space which<BR>
&gt;could<BR>
&gt; otherwise be used for productive applications<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It causes the infected computer's performance to be DRASTICALLY<BR>
&gt; REDUCED--Pentium machines which are stricken are known to slow down<BR>
&gt; to the speed of a 486<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It surreptitiously MODIFIES the underlying operating system,<BR>
&gt;causing<BR>
&gt; the CORE FUNCTIONALITY of the instrument to change RADICALLY<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It, through the use of Trojan-like ALTERATIONS to the core Java<BR>
&gt; APIs, may cause Java applets to MALFUNCTION. These effects are so<BR>
&gt; SEVERE that the designers of Java, Sun Microsystems, are taking<BR>
&gt;LEGAL<BR>
&gt; ACTION against the inventors of this terrible virus<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It, once installed, is VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE for the average user to<BR>
&gt; remove from the system<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It is known to create SECURITY HOLES, which can allow unknown users<BR>
&gt; to DELETE or DESTROY files on your hard drive<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It is known to cause many popular and reliable Internet browsers,<BR>
&gt; such as NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR and NETSCAPE COMMUNICATOR, to not<BR>
&gt;function<BR>
&gt; correctly<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It is even known to infect NEWLY PURCHASED computers coming from<BR>
&gt; repuatable manufacturers like COMPAQ and DELL. These companies<BR>
&gt;have<BR>
&gt; so far been POWERLESS to prevent this virus from being installed on<BR>
&gt; the computers they sell.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; * It is known to be UNDETECTABLE by most virus-checking software<BR>
&gt; packages<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The good news is that the JUSTICE DEPARTMENT is currently investigating the<BR>
&gt;rogue hackers who CONCOCTED this destructive virus. They have been traced<BR>
&gt;to<BR>
&gt;a Seattle suburb, and may face fines of ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER DAY for the<BR>
&gt;pernicious manner in which this virus is being distributed. The bad news<BR>
&gt;is<BR>
&gt;that millions of computers have ALREADY BEEN INFECTED. The inventors of<BR>
&gt;this<BR>
&gt;virus even have the gall to gleefully BOAST about this terrible fact on<BR>
&gt;their<BR>
&gt;web site!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Here's what YOU can do:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1) If you see a website with the &quot;Internet Explorer&quot; logo, do **NOT**<BR>
&gt; click on the logo. This can cause this virus to be DOWNLOADED and<BR>
&gt; INSTALLED on your system!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2) If your computer is ALREADY INFECTED, and it's a Windows-based PC,<BR>
&gt; call the technical support hotline at Microsoft (the company which<BR>
&gt; wrote Windows), and ask them for instructions on how to DISABLE and<BR>
&gt; REMOVE this virus. They should have instructions to do so.<BR>
&gt;<BR>

&gt; SCD MAILING LIST<BR>

&gt; Hi group,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; Chide in private and praise in public.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well said Glenn.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Although I am going to say this for list....<BR>
&gt; Dietmar, and anyone else, who feels the need to use<BR>
&gt; inappropriate language, your opinion means nothing when<BR>
<BR>
Personally, I feel that the most inappropraite language ever displayed on<BR>
this list had no four letter words in it at all. Remember the break up of<BR>
the maelstrom list? The childish behavoir of the leaders of the old and<BR>
new lists was far more insulting to me than any for letter words I've ever<BR>
heard. Kids hear four letter words every day. I'd rather let them read<BR>
the occassional 4 letter word and know that is it clearly inappropriate,<BR>
but in reality harmful to no one. <BR>
<BR>
The childish bickering and insults thrown during the breakup is an example<BR>
of a social situation that cannot be easily defined as right or wrong to a<BR>
child. The language was injurious, but it is more difficult to say why. <BR>
What parent stood up in that situation? None did. I guarantee that a<BR>
great many adults carry permanent scars from their childhood where some<BR>
person criticized them without uttering a single four letter word. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, where are all these so-called children? I've never seen them write<BR>
to the list. How many are out there? <BR>
<BR>
Why don't we just recognize that there are some young adults out there, and<BR>
that none of them are offended by swearing, but their prudish parents are? <BR>
So for their sakes, the young human beings who need our support, we should<BR>
watch our language. <BR>
<BR>
Bill<BR>

<BR>
Hi Bill,<BR>
 <BR>
Yes, I agree that the bickering which occurred on the old list was<BR>
a bigger problem. The reason I sent the post was not so much for<BR>
Dietmar, but to make sure that others did not think it was<BR>
acceptable behaviour on the list. I like the list as it is and<BR>
no one should feel the need to express themselves that way.<BR>
If I am wrong on this issue, I'd gladly bow to the majority.<BR>
People can email me direct about this issue (good or bad).<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Kids hear four letter words every day. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, however how many parents let them use the language<BR>
in front of them ? If a child uses such language and a parent<BR>
says nothing, does that not tell the child it is acceptable ?<BR>
I am not saying that anyone on the list is childish, but I think<BR>
you get the point ;) (I hope).<BR>
<BR>
On this list it is acceptable to talk about D. and BM, etc.<BR>
Of course it is common practice that we use these short forms<BR>
instead of the long form, mostly out of convenience. If we<BR>
used them on a different type of support list, some could<BR>
be offended. Living with IBD has forced many of us to get<BR>
over our skirmish attitudes towards this private issue.<BR>
I lived with D. for a year and lost weight before I would<BR>
finally go see a doctor.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Why don't we just recognize that there are some young adults<BR>
&gt; out there, and that none of them are offended by swearing,<BR>
&gt; but their prudish parents are?<BR>
<BR>
Just for the record, I have an 18 month old and another on the<BR>
way. So the message I wrote was not intended to apply to me<BR>
(at this point anyways). And as I mentioned in my post, I do<BR>
occasionally use those words in private... so I am by no<BR>
means prudish. I simply restrain myself from using them in public.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this clarifies what I wrote. :)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Annie, Welcome! I've only been here a few weeks myself and am still<BR>
tinkering with the scd diet in hopes it will work for me. In that light, re:<BR>
your question about enzymes, I can tell you they are by a company named<BR>
Vitamost, out of Ontario, Canada and the specific one I take is their<BR>
&quot;Dygest&quot; formulation, which is a mix of hydrocloric acid, bile and some other<BR>
&quot;natural&quot; digestive enzymes. But you can get such enzymes at just about any<BR>
healthfood store. I got mine from Vitamost simply cuz I'm working with a<BR>
nutritionist who knows their products and recommended them. I don't know yet<BR>
whether they're helping me or not; only been on them a few days. I'll keep<BR>
you posted.<BR>

Hi Pat, I have several amalgams and three or four crowns (porcelain, I<BR>
think, but they might be porcelain-covered gold). My amalgams are quite old.<BR>
 I am being tested for heavy metals because they are a concern. None removed<BR>
yet. But my M.D., who is a specialist in Environmental Medicine, told me<BR>
he's aware of about a group of about 400 patients who had their amalgams out.<BR>
 About 33% were &quot;significantly&quot; improved in health as a result, but the other<BR>
2/3'rds were only marginally so or reported no discernible improvement.<BR>
 Interesting...<BR>

Dear David,<BR>
This is a forum where people who are on, or who wish to attempt the SCD can<BR>
come for support. By writing to this address, your letter reaches<BR>
approximately 130 people and a lot of us share ideas for coping with the<BR>
illnesses described in the book. Please feel free to ask any questions or<BR>
to contribute any ideas on this subject. We are here to learn from, and to<BR>
support each other in our quest for good health. Occasionally, the subject<BR>
strays because you can't have this many people and not have conflicting<BR>
veiws, but cool heads usually bring the subject back to it's purpose.<BR>
Welcome &amp; good luck.<BR>

I agree it is interesting but perhaps not suprising. Mercury builds up<BR>
in the tissues of the body including the brain. Some people have<BR>
greater ability to excrete mercury than others. Dr. Hal Huggins, in his<BR>
book, &quot;It's all in Your Head&quot; talks a lot about why some people recover<BR>
quickly after having their mercury amalgams out, and others much more<BR>
slowly. Mostly, it has to do with differences in body chemistry. He<BR>
actually has gotten to the place where he can pretty well predict who<BR>
will recover rapidly and who will recover slowly just by looking at<BR>
someones blood work.<BR>
<BR>
I had my amalgams out 10 years ago. I had many amalgams. I did feel<BR>
some better but not dramatic improvement. Now, after reading Huggins<BR>
book and comparing my blood chemistry to what he talks about in his<BR>
book, I see why. I fit his profile for slow recovery pretty much dead<BR>
on. Until the body is helped to get rid of the mercury built up in the<BR>
tissues, people will not feel all that much better.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, as a result of reading Hal Huggins book, I was introduced<BR>
to another book called, &quot;Root Canal Cover Up&quot; by Dr. George Meinig, who<BR>
was a founder of the Association of Endodontists who specialize in doing<BR>
root canals. This book is extremely enlightening. It covers a ton of<BR>
research showing conclusively how root canals can actually be the cause<BR>
of many degenerative diseases including GI diseases. This research has,<BR>
unfortunately, been sucessfully covered up for decades. Dr. Meinig,<BR>
discovered this info in the associations library and was stunned, as he<BR>
had been doing root canals for many decades. To his credit, he actually<BR>
studied this research and was convinced that what he had been doing was<BR>
wrong. He is now dedicated to informing the public and the medical,<BR>
dental communities about this information.<BR>
<BR>
If you have root canals, or have had a lot of dental problems in the<BR>
past, I highly recommend that you read this book and at least consider<BR>
the research that was done by over 60 researchers including the now<BR>
famous Dr. Mayo. The book can be found at Hugnet.com or perhaps<BR>
Amazon.com.<BR>

 Hi there Miroslav,<BR>
<BR>
 Baking Soda is different to baking powder.<BR>
<BR>
 Baking Soda is Sodium Bicarbonate alone.<BR>
<BR>
 Baking Powder is a mixture of 1 part Sodium Bicarbonate and 2<BR>
 parts Cream of Tartar.<BR>
 You can mix up your own and avoid harmful additives and<BR>
starches that are also added to<BR>
 make it free-running. mix together and store in an airtight<BR>
glass jar.<BR>

creamy it reminds me of sour cream, but quite tart like yogurt. Would that<BR>

Dear Joan,<BR>
What are cavitations? I work as an office manager for a dental practice.<BR>
All the information I've gotten points to this whole amalgam thing being a<BR>
hoax which is additionally perpetrated by unscrupulous dentists who can<BR>
turn a quick buck by replacing them with more expensive composite (white)<BR>
restorations which are fine on anterior (front, non chewing) teeth, but<BR>
leak and don't stand up well to chewing and eventually become sensetive.<BR>
I've also been told that disturbing old amalgam fillings by removing them<BR>
causes dormant mercury to actively enter the system. Of course since my<BR>
source of information is primarily the american dental association, I take<BR>
this information with a grain of salt and beleive the truth to lie<BR>
somewhere in the middle of this controversy. Before you all start chewing<BR>
me up, let me just say that all I'm doing, is passing along information<BR>
I've been given, that should be evaluated before you all go ripping old<BR>
fillings out of your face.<BR>
Peace, Rachel<BR>

Don't know the answer to your questions except to say that for me it is<BR>
too early to tell as the dentist only did a DMPS challenge test to try<BR>
to determine the level of mercury in the body tissues. that test is not<BR>
yet back. I do know that I have read that there can be side affects (<BR>
why do there always have to be side affects?) to the use of DMPS and<BR>
DMSA, another mercury chelating drug (amino acid).<BR>
<BR>
I know that Dr. Hal Huggins, in his book, &quot;It's All in Your Head&quot;, does<BR>
not mention once the use of DMPS. I don't know why this is?? I do hope<BR>
to find out today though as I have a phone consultation scheduled with a<BR>
Dr. from his clinic. I also know that he does recommend the use of DMSA<BR>
on his web site as a great way to get mercury out of the brain, but not<BR>
in the high dosages-short durations, usually prescribed, but rather in<BR>
low dosages over long durations (1-2 years). He says this is more<BR>
effective and much easier on the patient!<BR>
<BR>
I have never read where mercury causes cavitations? Where did you learn<BR>
this?? I would think that if you have both then both need to be dealt<BR>
with??<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps I'll have some answers later. If so, you can be sure I'll let<BR>
you and the group know.<BR>

Dear Rachel and List,<BR>
<BR>
There is a discussion list called AMALGAMS which discusses this topic, I<BR>
heard about it from Vicki Westlund, I'd love to get on that list. <BR>
<BR>
BTW, do you guys take enzymes on the SCD diet, and if so, do you take<BR>
vegetarian or other types??<BR>
<BR>
Also, do you take psyllium for fiber?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
Don't want to rip you as I appreciate info from both sides of the issue.<BR>
<BR>
However, this is the standard ADA response that all dentists have ben<BR>
taught to respond with. Usually, they have a brochure that they can<BR>
hand out from the ADA that has this response in it. If mercury was, in<BR>
fact, conclusively found and admitted by the ADA to be toxic, imagine<BR>
the litigation that would result. Might make the tobacco litigation<BR>
look small. In fact, the ADA's response sounds surprisely similar to<BR>
tobacco's claims that nicotine isn't addictive and that smoking does not<BR>
cause cancer. They, until just recently, have been saying this for many<BR>
decades!!<BR>
<BR>
It shocked me to learn that when the ADA assures us that it is safe,<BR>
they never point to a single study that it is in fact safe. There has<BR>
never been one &quot;double blind&quot; scientific study done or reported by the<BR>
ADA proving mercury amalgams safety. Mercury Amlagams were<BR>
grandfathered by the FDA because it has been used since the late 1800's.<BR>
There is, however, a wealth of data, both scientific and anecdotal, that<BR>
points to mercury amalgams as a significant health risk. The ADA never<BR>
comments on this data.<BR>
<BR>
I suggest you get further info as suggested before here. &quot;It's All In<BR>
Your Head&quot; Dr. Hal Huggins. BTW, all dentists remove old mercury<BR>
amalgams all the time and replace them with new mercury amalgams. How<BR>
do they prevent &quot;dormant mercury&quot; from entering the system then? And if<BR>
mercury amalgams are safe, why do you and your dentist have to follow<BR>
very strict guidleines for the handling of, and disposal of, this highly<BR>
toxic substance.<BR>
<BR>
Oh well, enough. I am not trying to rip you, only trying to encourage<BR>
you to dig a little deeper. Keep it quiet with your Dentist/Employer<BR>
though, as it could cost you. If you are sick though, and don't have a<BR>
rational explanation for why you are, I believe our amalgams is one<BR>
place to at least consider.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps you are right, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Fact is,<BR>
that many people with strong healthy immune systems handle mercury<BR>
amalgams and root canals just fine. Lots of people smoked 3 packs a day<BR>
and lived to be a hundred too! It comes down to an individuals ability<BR>
to handle toxic substances. Some can, some can't.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your post,<BR>
<BR>

I don't remember the name of the yogurt I used. I will get the name for you<BR>
and let you<BR>
know. I bought it at the Whole Foods Market.<BR>
<BR>
This process has worked for me. My husband and I attend a meeting every<BR>
Thursday<BR>
night, so when I get home from work I boil the milk. Then I put the milk in<BR>
the refrigerator<BR>
while we are at our meeting, which lasts an hour. So when I get home about<BR>
8:45 pm I<BR>
put the mixture in the Yogourtmet and let it run until I get home from work<BR>
on Friday.<BR>
<BR>
I was using a regular saucepan to heat the milk, but I have scalded the<BR>
milk before<BR>
so I just bought a nice double boiler at Ikea. I haven't used it yet but I<BR>
hope it will make<BR>
the heating process not so tedious.<BR>
<BR>
My next project is to purchase some 8oz containers with reusable lids that<BR>
I can dish<BR>
up the prepared yogurt into with some fruit on the bottom. Maybe raisins,<BR>
nuts and<BR>
honey for instance. Then these can easily be packed in our lunch bags.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

FYI<BR>
<BR>
it appears that UC sufferers are mostly non-smokers, has anyone tried nicotine <BR>
gum or transdermal<BR>
patches. according to one study the nicotine and predisone act the same way, <BR>
with nicotine<BR>
be about 50% effective compared to predisone. i dont know where MD's are on <BR>
this, but<BR>
it may be a choice between UC and nicotine for maintaining remission. there <BR>
are about<BR>
57 articles on PubMed that discuss the use of nicotine in various colitis <BR>
applications,<BR>
either as a patch/gum/enema, with and without the use of 5-ASA drugs. it is <BR>
