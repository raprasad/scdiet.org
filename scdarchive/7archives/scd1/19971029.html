Hi Jeff,<BR>
After your recent letter about timing the yogurt making, I did just that.<BR>
From the time I took the 2 quarts of 1/2 &amp; 1/2 out of the refrigerator,<BR>
to being completely finished- yogurt in yogourmet: 35 min.! <BR>
27 min. to heat milk on med-low heat with lid on, with an occasional<BR>
stir. <BR>
7 min. to cool (putting pan in large metal bowl with water and ice<BR>
cubes). <BR>
1 min. to stir yogurt starter into small amount of the cooled 1/2 &amp; 1/2,<BR>
then stir all together. Put in yogurt maker, and WAIT patiently for many<BR>
hours. <BR>
Lucy<BR>
PS. During most of the time I was doing other kitchen duty, so it really<BR>
only took a few minutes of focusing on the yogurt. <BR>

Hello. My name is Teddy Haduong, and I'm a graduate student at Michigan State.<BR>
What you folks say about the scd diet interests me. My copy of the book should<BR>
be arriving any day now. I have what I would call moderate IBS. I get cramps,<BR>
bloating, and constipation. I eat a high-carb, high-refined sugar, high fiber<BR>
diet loaded with lots of starches. I'm open to the possibility that this is my<BR>
problem. My questions are as follows. How much does food cost per week? What<BR>
equipment would I have to buy? I don't have a car and therefore have little<BR>
access to a health food store (if there are any in Lansing) so is there a mail<BR>
order health food store I could order from? How much would that cost? How<BR>
long does it take to cook? I've never cooked in my life but am willing to try.<BR>
As you can see, my biggest concerns are money, time, and availability of the<BR>
stuff I would need to buy. If these questions are addressed elsewhere, please<BR>
direct me to them. What equipment would you recommend, how much is it, and<BR>
where can I buy it? Thanks, Teddy<BR>

To avoid burning the milk, it helps to stand there and stir the milk as<BR>
it's heating. I stir it with the candy thermometer I use to keep track of<BR>
the temperature. Yes, this is tedious, especially if you do a gallon at a<BR>
time as I do. What also helps is to heat the milk in a hot water bath<BR>
before cooking it. I put the (unopened) milk container in the sink and<BR>
fill the sink with hot water. Do this a couple of times and the temp you<BR>
start cooking the milk at will be up over 100 F (which means you cook it<BR>
over the burner a lot less time to get it to 180, so a lot less time to<BR>
burn the pot). To cool it down, do the opposite: a cold water bath in the<BR>
sink (just put the pot in the sink, and fill the sink around it with cold<BR>
water). Stirring as you go with the candy thermometer shortens the cooling<BR>
time. The whole process takes me about 45 minutes, start to finish.<BR>
<BR>
A double boiler sounds like a great idea, if you could find one big enough<BR>
to cook a gallon of milk at a time. The ones I've seen are only a quart or<BR>
so capacity. <BR>
<BR>
I also got a much better result when I started using the yogourmet starter.<BR>

<BR>
Hi Jeff,<BR>
I do use a thermometer to make sure the milk has cooled down to the<BR>
temperature recommended for adding Yogourmet powdered starter (under 44<BR>
C). If you are using commercial yogurt as a starter, Elaine recommends in<BR>
the book to let it cool down to room temperature or below. <BR>

A double boiler is a pan that nests on top of another pan. You put water in<BR>
the bottom<BR>
pan and the milk in the top pan. This way you are indirectly heating the<BR>
milk by the<BR>
boiling water instead of directly heating it on the stove's electric<BR>
element or gas flame.<BR>
This helps eliminate scalding. It is also useful for other hard to heat<BR>
items, such as chocolate,<BR>
which we can't have on SCD!<BR>
<BR>
Like I said before, I had a hard time finding a double boiler. I finally<BR>
found one at a store named<BR>
IKEA. I don't know if you have them where you live. The nice thing about<BR>
the one I got is that it<BR>
has a third pan insert that has holes in it for steaming vegetables. So<BR>
really the pan has 3 uses,<BR>
a regular sauce pan (the one that holds the water when using as a double<BR>
boiler or steamer, the<BR>
double boiler, and the steamer. Good deal for the money ... it was 39.95<BR>
USD.<BR>
<BR>
And yes, I have been taking the temperature of the milk before adding the<BR>
starter. Since I put<BR>
the milk in the refrigerator for about an hour I haven't had any problem<BR>
getting the milk cool<BR>
enough.<BR>

I would think it would be hard to find a gallon double boiler. The one I<BR>
just bought,<BR>
just barely holds 2 quarts.<BR>

My son is on the SCD diet and so far it is working so well, I cannot believe<BR>
it. I am almost afraid to speak about it, the diarrhea is gone, the first<BR>
time in 5 years, and the autistic like symptoms are slowly ameliorating! We<BR>
have a long way to go, but no doubt about it, there is progress. For the<BR>
first time in I don't know how long, I am not washing 2 or 3 pairs of<BR>
underwear per day!<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I am taking him out for Halloween, am planning to &quot;plant&quot; some<BR>
home-made SCD treats at my closest neighbors' houses, things he could have. <BR>
<BR>
So far, we are on very strict SCD, he does not tolerate nuts well as yet,<BR>
nor fruits. He tolerates almost all vegetables well.<BR>
<BR>
Any ideas, I am desperate! I just don't see how meat/vegetables translate<BR>
into a Halloween treat!!!<BR>
<BR>
Moira<BR>
<BR>
I was thinking of making the zucchini muffins, then giving him some alka<BR>
selzer gold for the allergic reaction he has to the nuts. So far, that's all<BR>
I can come up with. I don't want to even give a sucker, as it would feed his<BR>
candida, but may have to. I think he would be appeased by even one sucker,<BR>
as he never gets sweets at all. How much damage would one sucker do?<BR>

Hi Moira,<BR>
<BR>
Have you tried the pumpkin pie recipe in the book? Maybe your neighbors <BR>
would let you hide pumpkin pie in their refrigerator to surprise your <BR>
son? You could scoop small servings of the pumpkin pie into little <BR>
containers and wrap them in Halloween-colored cellophane to be festive.<BR>
<BR>
If you don't have time to cook your own pumpkin to use in the recipe, you <BR>
can buy frozen winter squash (2 packets) and make it with that. The pie <BR>
is a sweet, tasty treat. <BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps. :)<BR>

I use a candy thermometer with a large metal clip that I attach to the rim<BR>
of the stainless-stell pot (we make a 1-gallon / 4-liter batch at one go);<BR>
you can buy them in any cookware store. I feel most comfortable if I can<BR>
see the actual reading instead of just guessing, esp. when one first brings<BR>
the temp. up to near-boiling (the cooling-down temp of &quot;room-temp&quot; is good<BR>
enough if you want to wing it, but for that I also use the thermometer).<BR>

You DON'T need a double boiler: simply get yourself a good-quality<BR>
stainless-steel pot (we use one that hold about 2 gallons so there's lots<BR>
of room left after dumping a 1-gallon (4-liter) amount of milk into it.<BR>
<BR>
KISS: &quot;Keep it simple, stupid&quot;, right?<BR>
<BR>
Besides, most cheap double boilers are aluminum, and alu is bad for you<BR>
(causes Alzheimer's, they think,a mong other problems).<BR>

I have been making a sort of candy that is based on the almond crisp recipe.<BR>
Stir about 4 T melted butter into about a cup of honey and heat it in a pan<BR>
in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes until the mixture is bubbly brown.<BR>
Then take it out of the oven, stir it again and let it cool. It will be a<BR>
firm carmel-like consistency when completely cool. You could scoop it out<BR>
by the spoonful and wrap it in wax paper or plastic wrap and call it<BR>
caramels. I think it tastes great with apples, but I haven't figured out if<BR>
I could actually get it to stick to a whole apple. I can't eat any dairy,<BR>
but this seems to be fine.<BR>
<BR>
This mixture can be heated for a longer time to get a harder caramel that<BR>
might be used as a sucker, but it's tricky not to burn the mixture as it<BR>
approaches the hardening stage.<BR>

Dear FANTASTIC list members,<BR>
Today you all receive a GIANT hug and kiss from a very grateful sister<BR>
of a CD sufferer.<BR>
Karen is 30 yrs old and was diagnosed with CD at age 18. She has had 5<BR>
operations,<BR>
bowel resections, fistula problems, etc. You all know the score. And she<BR>
puts up with<BR>
at least 5 to 6 hospital stays per year. However, this past June, her CD<BR>
became worse<BR>
than ever (terrible D, joint pain that could not be controlled, etc.)<BR>
Her doctors<BR>
decided their only course of action was to up her predinisone levels<BR>
considerably to <BR>
stop the D and then cut the dosage in half. This brought on severe<BR>
migraine headaches<BR>
that not even Demerol or morphine could stop. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, my sister has always tried to deny the existence of her<BR>
disease and<BR>
blindly follow whatever her doctors prescribed. But I was tired of<BR>
seeing the pro-<BR>
fessionals use her as their prime guinea pig, and went to work on my own<BR>
seeking out<BR>
new info on the net (somehow that sounds rather Star-Trek like, doesn't<BR>
it?) Luckily,<BR>
I stumbled onto this group and ordered Elaine's book. <BR>
<BR>
Karen is currently without-computer, so I sent her &quot;THE BOOK&quot; and have<BR>
been bombarding<BR>
her ever since with copies of your postings via snail-mail. I ordered a<BR>
yogurt maker<BR>
from Williams Sonoma, ordered the almond nut flour from Hughsons and<BR>
found sources for<BR>
the dry curd cheese. <BR>
<BR>
After two months, she has finally started the SCD and I'm anxiously<BR>
awaiting word of<BR>
how it is going for her. I will keep you posted and also pass on any<BR>
questions she has.<BR>
<BR>
FINALLY, I must thank you all again!!! It was not my &quot;nagging&quot; that<BR>
convinced her to<BR>
take back her own health and try something new, but all the messages<BR>
from people who<BR>
have &quot;been there&quot;. I think she's always felt so alone with her CD, she<BR>
has never<BR>
talked with other people who have it. The change in her attitude has<BR>
been remarkable.<BR>
<BR>
P.S. I'm sure you get tired of being asked this, but any words of<BR>
encouragement you could offer Karen would be GREATLY appreciated. You<BR>
are all my Heroes!! Thanks!!<BR>
<BR>
A sincerely grateful sister,<BR>

I have found that initially there seemed to be some extra expense, with<BR>
buying nuts in abundance and such. However, it all evens out. I find<BR>
that I save a lot of money on this diet since I don't eat out in<BR>
restaurants anymore unless I have to. Also, principle food items for me<BR>
are now homemade split pea soup and cooked lima beans, which I love. <BR>
They are really inexpensive. But ultimately, having my health (and<BR>
life) back are what make it all worth it.<BR>

&gt; My son is on the SCD diet and I am planning to &quot;plant&quot; some<BR>
&gt; home-made SCD treats at my closest neighbors' houses, things he could<BR>
&gt; have....<BR>
<BR>
Maybe those fruit rolls (dried fruit that is pressed) - I suspect this<BR>
may cause D... or might have unlabeled sucrose or other nasties. Usually<BR>
you can find them in natural food stores.How about money? That way, he<BR>
can go out and buy himself a toy, or some cool clothes. I'd love to get<BR>
money. Tell him that candy rots your teeth, and will make him sick, but<BR>
the money won't! He'll probably appreciate that (I would).<BR>

Message-ID: &lt;971030095711_160241872@emout06.mail.aol.com&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hi Rachel -<BR>
<BR>
i will quote what cavitations are:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;during the early 1950's some european physicians and dentists reported the<BR>
sockets of numbers of old tooth extraction sites had not filled in<BR>
completely, thereby leaving thin holes in the bones of the jaw and at times,<BR>
larger areas. these cavitations result when the periodontal ligament (the<BR>
tough fibrous tissue) that holds the root of a tooth to its bony socket,<BR>
fails to break down and disappear during the healing process. thus, as the<BR>
socket heals and fills in with new bone, this thin strip of fibrous tissue<BR>
prevents the growth of new bone in that area, causing a narrow space to<BR>
remain. whatever bacteria and toxins were trapped in the periodontal membrane<BR>
remain in the jaw as a CHRONIC INFECTION.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Rachel, because you are &quot;up front&quot; in the office and not in back with your<BR>
fellow employees, let me &quot;clue you in&quot; on your employees safety precautions<BR>
in handling mercury:<BR>
<BR>
in the mid 1980's all dentists were sent a copy of a list of recommendations<BR>
for their protection against mercury and scrap amalgam. It was published by<BR>
the council on dental materials and devised by the ADA. it warned of the<BR>
severe hazards of the vapor coming from scrap amalgam. scrap amalgam is the<BR>
part of the filling left over when you have a filling placed. the scrap is<BR>
put into a can or a box and saved to be returned for reclamation. the proper<BR>
handling of this dangerous material that emits such harmful vapors is<BR>
considered such a problem that it is recommended that dental students be<BR>
taught about these hazards as well. here are the councils recommendations:<BR>
<BR>
1. store mercury in unbreakable, tightly sealed containers.<BR>
2. perform all operations involving mercury over areas that have impervious<BR>
and suitably lipped surfaces so as to confine and facilitate recovery of<BR>
spilled mercury or amalgam.<BR>
3. clean up any spilled mercury immediately. droplets may be picked up with<BR>
narrow tubing connected to the low-volume aspirator of the dental unit.<BR>
4. use tightly closed capsules during amalgamation while it is being mixed.<BR>
5. use a NO TOUCH technique for handling the amalgam.<BR>
6. salvage all amalgam scrap and store it under water.<BR>
7. work in well ventilated spaces.<BR>
8. avoid carpeting dental operatories as decontamination is not possible.<BR>
9. eliminate the use of mercury-containing solutions<BR>
10. avoid heating mercury or amalgam.<BR>
11. use water spray and suction when grinding dental amalgam<BR>
12. use conventional dental amalgam compacting procedures, manual and<BR>
mechanical, but do not use ultrasonic amalgam condensers.<BR>
13. perform yearly mercury determinations on all personnel regularly employed<BR>
in dental offices.<BR>
14. have periodic mercury vapor level determinations made in operatories.<BR>
15. alert all personnel involved in handling mercury, especially during<BR>
training or indoctrination periods, of the potential hazard of mercury vapor<BR>
and the necessity for observing good mercury hygiene practices.<BR>
<BR>
if mercury is so safe, why these rules? its a hazard for the dentist to<BR>
handle it, but its ok to put it in our mouths???<BR>
<BR>
as for what Pat has said on certain people being able to tolerate it - yes<BR>
and no. in other words mercury is probably THE cause for ALL our problems<BR>
WHETHER THEY HAVE HAPPENED YET OR NOT. because the immune system is down, and<BR>
you cant seem to get back up, people need to look at ALL areas keeping their<BR>
system down. this is one of those areas and possibly THE major one. very<BR>
quickly, i had blood work done. the lab said &quot;the infection is coming from<BR>
the mouth&quot;. why would they say this? they could have said anything. theres no<BR>
money here to be made from this lab. then i went to the dentist and he<BR>
checked for cavitations - which is basically dead bacteria. what i am tying<BR>
in is this: i have been in detox for 3 years. i have made alot of progress<BR>
but there is SOMETHING in the way. i cant tell you what it is but the lab<BR>
sure has refocused my perspective. there is a fence in front of me and i cant<BR>
jump it. thats the only way i can explain it. i knew this BEFORE the results<BR>
came back. by now, my system should be responding. i have taken one heck of a<BR>
load off of it.<BR>
<BR>
common sense is ANYTHING that doesnt belong in the body and that includes bad<BR>
food (God just didnt make the system to process this stuff), will have an<BR>
effect on that body - sooner or later. let alone a metal! arent they now<BR>
admitting to aluminum causing alzheimers?<BR>
<BR>
hope this answers your question but i would seriously consider checking it<BR>
out. i apologize for the length of this post.<BR>
<BR>
take care -<BR>

&gt;I have found that initially there seemed to be some extra expense, with<BR>
&gt;buying nuts in abundance and such. However, it all evens out. I find<BR>
&gt;that I save a lot of money on this diet since I don't eat out in<BR>
&gt;restaurants anymore unless I have to. Also, principle food items for me<BR>
&gt;are now homemade split pea soup and cooked lima beans, which I love. <BR>
&gt;They are really inexpensive. But ultimately, having my health (and<BR>
&gt;life) back are what make it all worth it.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Yes, I agree, the expense is definitely there. <BR>
<BR>
However, my friends are taking their autistic kids back east for prednisone<BR>
treatments, how much does that cost? Think of putting 2, 3, 4, 5 year old<BR>
children through intensive prednisone treatments.<BR>
<BR>
The behavioral mod therapy our autistic kids get costs 3000 per month or more. <BR>
<BR>
The seizure medications, the sleeping pills, the ritalin, the psychotropic<BR>
drugs, the Prozac, the Zoloft, all are being given to autistic kids, at what<BR>
cost???<BR>
<BR>
Our Autistic Society of America, Dr Bernie Rimland, the most famous autism<BR>
researcher, none of these people mention Elaine's diet, why?????????<BR>
<BR>
Because it cures the many of the kids of their so-called autism!!! And<BR>
then, what would these people do for a living?????<BR>

I make my yogurt the same way. I have a temperature probe with my microwave.<BR>
I put the probe in the milk, code in 199 degrees, hit the start button, then<BR>
forget about the cooking until the microwave tells me the cooking is done,<BR>

<BR>
Even though I code in 199 degrees, the milk has never burned.<BR>

&gt; To avoid burning the milk, it helps to stand there and stir the milk as<BR>
&gt; it's heating. I stir it with the candy thermometer I use to keep track of<BR>
&gt; the temperature. Yes, this is tedious, ...<BR>
<BR>
The process that I use for making the yogurt is to put 2 cups half/half and<BR>
2 cups homo milk in a regular pot. Rinse out the measuring cup to (just in<BR>
case) avoid contaminating the yogurt starter (later step). Turn stove on high,<BR>
stirring slowly and constantly for about 7-9 minutes. Take off the stove just<BR>
when it is boiling and just before it starts to boil upwards. I then put it<BR>
in the sink (no lid) and surround with cold water until pot starts to float.<BR>
Walk away for 20-30 minutes (TV or whatever). By then a simple &quot;pinky&quot;<BR>
(little finger) test will confirm that the milk is cooled. Finish process<BR>
with 1/4 cup yogurt starter mixed with 1/2 cup milk from pot (into measuring<BR>
cup already used to measure the milk), stir with wisk.<BR>
<BR>
I don't bother with a thermometer, and I've had no problems this way. I also<BR>
tend to make it at night, and leave it until the morning 36 hours later. Empty<BR>
containers, put containers and pot into dishwasher. Make more yogurt that<BR>
night. I make a quart (8 containers) every 2 days (that's how much my yogurt<BR>
maker holds) and eat 3-4 containers/day.<BR>
<BR>
Not necessarily the best way, however it works well for me.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks...Dan.<BR>

Hi all, I have been on the scd since late August and on this list-server<BR>
the same length of time. My gut problems are just IBD or maybe IBS -<BR>
certainly need to be dealt with but not at &quot;serious&quot; critical care stage<BR>
(thank the powers!). However, my 85 year old uncle, who has had what his<BR>
doctors call &quot;diverticulitis&quot; (sp?) for over 40 years, has had very serious<BR>
medical problems in the last three years. Had several partial colon removals<BR>
and finally, in Sept. , had the rest of it out. Question: Is anyone out<BR>
there on the SCD who has had a total colon removal? Is it worth my trying to<BR>
tell him about the SCD at this stage? As you all can well imagine, not a<BR>
single one of the MD's he's seen over the years has ever once suggested his<BR>
diet may be the problem. In fact, they've told him he can eat whatever he<BR>
wants! Any info/comments on this wd be appreciated. Thanks,<BR>

So you're saying smoking did NOT prevent, nor resolve, your Crohn's? <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the study that I've seen was very specific: smoking<BR>
(according to this study, which I can't refer you to right now, maybe<BR>
someone else can search for it) relieves COLITIS, but NOT Crohn's! They<BR>
were VERY clear on that. Strange, eh?<BR>
<BR>
So that would tie in with you: you have CD, and smoking neither improved<BR>
nor prevented it, right? Of course, this does not mean that if you STOP<BR>
smoking, this will stop the Crohn's! (unfortunately).<BR>

Hi Jeff and the group.<BR>
<BR>
Someone in a past post once mentioned they didnt appreciate spending alot of<BR>
time making yoghurt.<BR>
I have been making it near five years now. A more recent post claimed a<BR>
time of thirty five minutes to make a batch of yogurt .<BR>
So being curious I timed myself. From start to finish 29 minutes and two<BR>
more to clean up the kettle I heat the milk in. That gives me three litres<BR>
of good yogurt.<BR>
Now if I can just locate a larger blow torch to heat the milk faster.<BR>

I would think there are many slightly different ways to successfully make<BR>
yogurt. However I am rather doubtful about putting anything into the yogurt,<BR>
that has not been sterilized including my fingers. Any bacteria on the<BR>
finger is going to be incubated along with the yogurt.<BR>

I guess in the world of microwaves fax machines and e-mail, thirty<BR>

During a visit to a local poultry production facility (a.k.a. chicken<BR>

to the water of the birds &quot;as needed&quot;.<BR>
What got my attention was the skull and crossbones symbol on the<BR>
packets! I picked one up and found that it contained potassium<BR>
permangenate and arsenic! The manager of the place said that it is<BR>
addded to water for all birds from 3 weeks until harvest. It is supposed<BR>
to control intestinal parasites and increase appetitie of the birds.<BR>
I have no idea what the concentration of As is in the water, what amount<BR>
each bird ingests, etc. But...maybe that explains the As which we all<BR>
seem to find in analyses.<BR>

Very interesting that you mention seasonal variations may have an effect on<BR>
UC or CD. I have seen some study results that show this to be the case.<BR>
 This time of year, in fact, is often among the worst for UC/CD sufferers.<BR>
<BR>
Might this be related to M. Paratuberculosis levels in dairy shown to be<BR>
elevated during the spring and fall seasons when cows are under more stress<BR>
in northern climates.<BR>

Those of you looking for an inexpensive place to buy almonds,<BR>
Costco sells a 2 pound bag for under $5.00 which is a lot <BR>
less than the grocery store sells them for. The Corona grain<BR>

Initially it does seem that you spend more money on this diet. I<BR>
also save by not going to restaurants (nice or junk). As well,<BR>
when I go to the grocery store, I tend to bypass all the middle<BR>
aisles since I only get meat, dairy, veggies and fruits, which<BR>
saves time too ;) . Have you ever noticed that all the expensive<BR>
stuff are in the middle aisles (and tax is charged on them).<BR>
I spend less on medication, vitamins, ... Feeling good means no<BR>
downtime from work (by using up vacation days if necessary).<BR>
I look for bargains... large quatity of honey, case of Welch's<BR>
grape juice, case of almond flour, ...<BR>
<BR>
In the long run, the cost is not much different.<BR>
<BR>

effort and I hope you just continue on, no matter what little set backs you<BR>
have. I made the chicken soup which my kids will not ordinarly eat because it<BR>
has vegetables in it, but because the scd soup had the carrots grated up and<BR>
the broth turned orange, I told them it was halloween soup and they all ate<BR>
it! Even my eighteen year old son and his friends (well, they'll eat<BR>
anything) so now I have to make more. You just keep plugging away, Moira -<BR>

&gt;Very interesting that you mention seasonal variations may have an effect on<BR>
&gt;UC or CD. I have seen some study results that show this to be the case.<BR>
&gt; This time of year, in fact, is often among the worst for UC/CD sufferers.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
OK, can you pin it down? (Like: give a specific source?)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Might this be related to M. Paratuberculosis levels in dairy shown to be<BR>
&gt;elevated during the spring and fall seasons <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
OK #2, can you pin THIS down, too?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
when cows are under more stress<BR>
&gt;in northern climates.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Good hypothesis. I like it. Now, if you could find actual ref's for the<BR>
above 2 statements, that would be great!<BR>
<BR>
(By the way, Keith/Odd/Barb et al, is anyone making note of this, or we're<BR>
just letting it mill our in our minds? I'm not too good on note-keeping<BR>
myself)<BR>

&gt;&gt; I too am very interested in the technical paper you have on &quot;Intestinal<BR>
&gt;&gt; Dysbiosis and the Causes of Disease&quot;. I have had a problem with<BR>
&gt;&gt; overgrowth of klebsiella and have had various auto-immune problems. I<BR>
&gt;&gt; realize it could get very expensive for you if a lot of people are<BR>
&gt;&gt; interested, I would be happy to reimburse you for copying and postage<BR>
&gt;&gt; costs. Otherwise, if you could tell me where I might come across it on<BR>
&gt;&gt; my own, I'd greatly appreciate it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Hello Denise,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You're near CA's capital city, Sacramento, aren't you?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I sent you the paper today. I hope it arrives okay. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Don't worry about reimbursing me ... it cost me about $2.10 but if you<BR>
&gt;send cash, I can't spend it here in Europe, and if you send a check, the<BR>
&gt;bank will charge more than the face value to deposit it. Anyways, it's<BR>
&gt;not going to put me in the poor house :?)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;To tell true, I doubt very much that there will be a large demand for<BR>
&gt;this document. It's very technical so I don't suppose many other people<BR>
&gt;will want it. Only you, Odd, and Dietmar have asked for it so far but<BR>
&gt;maybe if there are a couple other requests, could I ask one of you to<BR>
&gt;copy your paper and mail it please?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
1) As Keith writes, it IS quite technical (ie. you have to really be<BR>
conversant with medical lingo to get anything out of it ... i.e. if you<BR>
don't know what &quot;dysbiosis&quot; means right off the batthen don't even bother<BR>
asking for it, that's your first clue that you won't understand much in it)<BR>
<BR>
2) Anyone living in Canada who wants a copy, you can ask me. <BR>
<BR>
3) I would suppose (speaking for Denise here without having asked her<BR>
permission) that she'd be OK with sending a coopy to anyone in Yankeeland<BR>
once she receives her own?<BR>
<BR>
... &quot;Ask, and it shall be gotten unto you&quot;, or something like that?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Best wishes,<BR>

&gt;&gt;High incidence of Smoking CD sufferers and Low incidence of Non-smoking UC<BR>
&gt;&gt;sufferers. <BR>
<BR>
Who said that? I missed it; I thought what I'd written was along the lines<BR>
of &quot;a study I've come across said that smoking resolves / reduces UC but<BR>
does NOT make any improvement with CD ... you're saying the opposite (sort<BR>
of, though not exactly)?<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I have heard the theory that the pathogen responsible for the<BR>
&gt;&gt;initial damage in UC and CD is identical. The bodies reaction to this<BR>
&gt;&gt;pathogen (the immuno-response) differs based on the presence of nicotine in<BR>
&gt;&gt;the system.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
That's one I'd not heard before, about the nicotine difference.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;I have been a smoker for 10 years. Diagnosed with CD 1 year ago today.<BR>
&gt;&gt;Resection 4 weeks ago. SCDiet started this week. Ex-smoker for 28 days.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;To the Ex Smoker:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Congratulations on the 28 days smoke free . The most difficult days are<BR>
&gt;behind you. The most treacherous days lies ahead.<BR>
&gt;I was 25 years a smoker, now 29 years EXsmoker. The best thing I ever did<BR>
&gt;was stop smoking. (Other than marrying my good wife. I had to say that.<BR>
&gt;She monitors these posts)<BR>
<BR>
Good for you!<BR>

Dear Jeff,<BR>
I remember hearing your initial resistance and thinking you wouldn't last<BR>
long. So I'm glad to hear you are adjusting to the new routine. I also<BR>
didn't spend much time in the kitchen before scd. I can credit the diet<BR>
for breaking my long standing restaurant habit. I was truly addicted to<BR>
going out to dinner. So besides changing what I was eating, changing<BR>
where I was eating was tough. Now I'm glad I enjoy eating at home. Your<BR>
cooking skills should improve with time so you won't be needing to spend<BR>
so much time in the kitchen.<BR>
Congratulations!<BR>
Lucy<BR>

&gt;I guess in the world of microwaves fax machines and e-mail, thirty<BR>

&gt;needed so be it.....<BR>
&gt;You are hearing what I think is my initial resistance to a new time<BR>
&gt;consuming thing in my life (I've been averaging 10 hours in the <BR>
&gt;kitchen<BR>
&gt;each week on the SCD, compared to half an hour before diet)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Anyway, I know it's worth the effort; I am seeing results, and am <BR>
&gt;quite<BR>
&gt;satisfied and hopeful with things thus far......<BR>

&gt;I left my son with a respite worker who is from a company that specializes<BR>
&gt;in special needs.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I left very detailed written instructions and all the food was prepared,<BR>
all<BR>
&gt;on one special shelf in the fridge, etc.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I came home and *none* of his SCD diet food was eaten.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;She gave him wheat cereal, milk, and two unripe bananas.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I could have cried!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I feel I can never leave him, not even for an hour.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;How much damage would this one incident do?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I know he was making so much progress on the diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;When I came out he was zoned, off in his own world again completely.<BR>

Dear William,<BR>
<BR>
He is horribly allergic to dairy, I have held off so far on doing any of the<BR>
yogurt or dry curd foods so far. Also, he does not tolerate nuts or eggs<BR>
well. So far, we have been eating lots of fish, meat, veggies, etc. very<BR>
little fruit, he has candida from years of antibiotics.<BR>
<BR>
Moira<BR>
<BR>
Also, I am already cooking/food processing it seems 24 hours a day. I have<BR>
to do things one step at a time, like I would like to know how to make<BR>
pemmican, for example, a very easy protein to digest. This is an all day<BR>
project in itself. I can only do so much, I have two other kids. Already I<BR>
am spending all my time in the health food store, buying veggies without<BR>
pesticides. Then I come home and my neighbor has hired a pesticide service<BR>
to spray his yard for 20 minutes, spewing out toxins all over my yard as<BR>
well. Sometimes I get discouraged.<BR>
<BR>
Why do you think yogurt is so important???<BR>
<BR>
Also, my own health is bad as I have spent 3 years at least chasing down<BR>
therapies for my son, I am hoping this is going to get him better, it looks<BR>
like it will. But I am very fatigued from years of stress over this.<BR>

&gt;effort and I hope you just continue on, no matter what little set backs you<BR>
&gt;have. I made the chicken soup which my kids will not ordinarly eat because it<BR>
&gt;has vegetables in it, but because the scd soup had the carrots grated up and<BR>
&gt;the broth turned orange, I told them it was halloween soup and they all ate<BR>
&gt;it! Even my eighteen year old son and his friends (well, they'll eat<BR>
&gt;anything) so now I have to make more. You just keep plugging away, Moira -<BR>
&gt;because I think it will be worth it. Take care, Jane.<BR>

Thanks, Jane.<BR>
<BR>
The two therapists who worked with my son noticed a difference in him. I<BR>
found out that the respite worker had given him not only 2 ripe bananas, but<BR>
as much cereal and milk as he wanted. He was totally spacey and started<BR>
spacing out on fans again. Gosh! Anyway, the good news is, he is back on the<BR>
diet. I have a new respite worker for next Thursday and am praying she can<BR>
just feed him what I have already prepared for him in the refrigerator. I am<BR>
literally afraid to leave this house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>

My son is helping me in the kitchen. His favorite task is helping with green<BR>
beans, he cuts off the ends (with a dull knife!) He also loves helping when<BR>
I do the food processor, I let him turn it on for me.<BR>
<BR>
Somewhere I read that the average housewife used to spend 2 to 3 hours per<BR>
day on food preparation. Now it is under 20 minutes.<BR>

I think I am up to about 8 hours per day of food preparation--just<BR>

I'm in San Jose. I had a nearby PW store order me baker's cheese, which<BR>
is another name for dry curd cottage cheese. I think most stores can<BR>
order it for you.<BR>

&gt;carrots, celery, and kale, diluted at least 50% with water.<BR>
