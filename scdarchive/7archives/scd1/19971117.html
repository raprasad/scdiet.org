Hello all,<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whey&quot; is what's left over after the &quot;curds&quot; are taken out, when you<BR>
culture milk. It has nothing to do with wheat. Remember your nursery<BR>
rhymes? E.g., the liquid in our yoghurt is a type of whey. Whey from milk<BR>
has protein in it (casein). It may have other stuff in it that we can't<BR>
use, such as lactose -- depending on what the fermentation process is.<BR>

Dear Joan,<BR>
<BR>
Well, I made the Lt. version of bread last Friday. I made it in the small<BR>
set of 4 baking pans, putting about 1/4 batter in each (really not quite<BR>
enough for those loaf pans) so next time will just put all the batter into<BR>
only 3 pans. I baked an hour (it just wouldn't get brown!) and when the<BR>
knife was inserted into one of the little loaves, it came out clean as a<BR>
whistle!<BR>
<BR>
I have tried the bread...don't like the smell of it at all, however, it<BR>
ain't bad sliced very thin and toasted in my small countertop oven. I<BR>
tried almond butter smeared on the top of one of the slices<BR>
toasted...didn't like it...just too much almonds...bread and top. But,<BR>
cheddar cheese slices on top with a little mustard tasted pretty good,<BR>
along with olives on the side. Nice little snack. Don't see myself<BR>
toasting this for breakfast...will stick to my muffins for that.<BR>
<BR>
I just wonder if you made the bread in a large loaf pan, or the 4 small<BR>
ones? Like she suggested in the given recipe?<BR>
<BR>
What I find with these recipes, is that they are such an exercise in<BR>
putting my intuition to good use! I find I have to be really present when<BR>
mixing the ingredients to see if the amounts are &quot;enough&quot; and I've never<BR>
been much into baking...until now! But, I keep adjusting, altering,<BR>
feeling the mixture as I prepare it and I am really coming up with food<BR>
that is pretty good. I have been on the diet 5 months now and have gained<BR>
back all the weight I had lost! Hope I don't gain anymore! But, this half<BR>
and half yogurt, pumpkin cookies, banana bread, pecan/honey crisps,<BR>
muffins, wouldn't have anything to do with that, would they?<BR>
<BR>
Joan, let us know how your banana bread experiment comes out. I made<BR>
banana bread recently, putting in pecans and using the small loaf pans and<BR>
it turned out really wonderful...one of the best things on the diet! Hard<BR>
to restrain myself from eating a loaf at a time!<BR>

&gt;&lt;&lt; &gt;I also miss bread and today after being on the diet 5 months, will<BR>
&gt; &gt;experiment with the Lt. Bread verson of Lois Lang's Luscious Bread.<BR>
&gt; &gt;Someone on the internet group gave us this recipe several weeks ago.<BR>
&gt; &gt;Supposedly, it's best when toasted.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Let's give it a try, huh?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;Prateeksha<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;im sticking with the original recipe! this bread fell apart all to hell! what<BR>
&gt;i would also like to try is the banana bread recipe OMITTING the bananas and<BR>
&gt;the sweet stuff and see if a regular bread would turn out just as soft. may<BR>
&gt;have to add another egg? dont know but want to try getting a softer bread and<BR>
&gt;the banana bread would be perfect.<BR>

No, but I have a ton of mercury amalgams in my mouth! and his hair analysis<BR>
shows high mercury/low calcium for example. Anyway, do you have ideas for my<BR>
questions? And also, couldn't it have been the SBOs that got rid of the<BR>
candida???<BR>
<BR>
I thought no SBOS on this diet?<BR>

&gt;&gt; Dear Pat,<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Thanks SO MUCH for the info about calcium lactate, I read in Elaine's<BR>
&gt;&gt; book<BR>
&gt;&gt; that children/babies may need extra calcium, so I gave him this, never<BR>
&gt;&gt; even<BR>
&gt;&gt; thinking about lactose! Thanks so much. [Pat Sullivan] Your welcome! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; I think now that you mention it she recommends calcium AEP in the<BR>
&gt;&gt; book, will<BR>
&gt;&gt; look for it. [Pat Sullivan] Actually, I don't see where she mentions<BR>
&gt;&gt; AEP specifically. This is something I read elswhere and don't<BR>
&gt;&gt; remember where. <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; I need some advice on vitamins/minerals. Should I get the vitamins<BR>
&gt;&gt; from<BR>
&gt;&gt; Freeda, or is there a brand available at the health food store? Also,<BR>
&gt;&gt; do<BR>
&gt;&gt; most of you find you need a B12 shot, as in the book she mentioned<BR>
&gt;&gt; that some<BR>
&gt;&gt; people do need a boost of their B12. Does anyone have any brands of<BR>
&gt;&gt; calcium<BR>
&gt;&gt; (AEP) that they recommend. [Pat Sullivan] Personally, I am currently<BR>
&gt;&gt; using vitamins and minerals called Matrix which I get from Peak Energy<BR>
&gt;&gt; 1-800-331-2303. Like Elaine recommends, these are low dosage but are<BR>
&gt;&gt; supposed to be extremely well absorbed and are all in the &quot;active&quot;<BR>
&gt;&gt; forms, expecially the minerals. This company focuses on dealing with<BR>
&gt;&gt; Mercury Toxic individuals and thus they recommend very low dosages of<BR>
&gt;&gt; B12 since it is supposed to &quot;methylate&quot; mercury which in their minds<BR>
&gt;&gt; is bad since methyl mercury is 50 - 100 times more toxic than straight<BR>
&gt;&gt; mercury. I am not aware that I need more b12 as I have not been<BR>
&gt;&gt; tested. <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; How do you know if you need a B12 shot? [Pat Sullivan] There are<BR>
&gt;&gt; tests that a doctor can do to determine levels of b12 and whether or<BR>
&gt;&gt; not you need injections. They also look for anemia as low b12 is one<BR>
&gt;&gt; of the causes of anemia <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; As far as soil based and olive leaf extract, it was my understanding<BR>
&gt;&gt; that<BR>
&gt;&gt; Elaine was NOT for them. It was my feeling she was very strongly<BR>
&gt;&gt; against them. [Pat Sullivan] If so, it is not in her book and I don't<BR>
&gt;&gt; remember reading it here. I've only been on this list for about 45<BR>
&gt;&gt; days so it could be previous to that.She obviously highly recommends<BR>
&gt;&gt; Yoghurt which carries lots of these types of bacterias into the<BR>
&gt;&gt; intestinal tract. In my case, I still cannot yet tolerate Yoghurt or<BR>
&gt;&gt; cheese and thus am missing out on this important element unless I take<BR>
&gt;&gt; them in capsule or powder form, which I do.<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Some of the parents of autistic kids are having great results with<BR>
&gt;&gt; soil<BR>
&gt;&gt; based organisms, they replace the yeast and bad bacteria in the<BR>
&gt;&gt; intestine,<BR>
&gt;&gt; so I am very torn on this issue. My best friend up in Washington is<BR>
&gt;&gt; having<BR>
&gt;&gt; great results, as are others. She gave her son SBOs and then tested<BR>
&gt;&gt; his<BR>
&gt;&gt; urine and his yeast and bad bacteria were nearly gone. [Pat Sullivan]<BR>
&gt;&gt; I would go with this if I were you! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; I am wondering if our kids have had SO MANY antibiotics that they may<BR>
&gt;&gt; need a<BR>
&gt;&gt; boost from the soil based to get rid of the dysbiosis, and then<BR>
&gt;&gt; MAINTAIN the<BR>
&gt;&gt; new flora with Elaine's diet. What does the List think? [Pat<BR>
&gt;&gt; Sullivan] I think you are correct and unless Elaine has a contrary<BR>
&gt;&gt; opinion I would go with what is working for others in the treatment of<BR>
&gt;&gt; your son. <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Do you think it is ok to give him some garlic, I tried some raw garlic<BR>
&gt;&gt; myself and wow, talk about die off, I only took about half a clove and<BR>
&gt;&gt; had<BR>
&gt;&gt; MAJOR die off the next day! [Pat Sullivan] Small amounts and then<BR>
&gt;&gt; gradually build up! Garlic is extremley effective as you discovered.<BR>
&gt;&gt; I would certainly recommend it for you but start slow and then<BR>
&gt;&gt; gradually add more! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; I read in a book on garlic that aged garlic is better for candida, do<BR>
&gt;&gt; you<BR>
&gt;&gt; know what kind to get? [Pat Sullivan] Kyolic Aged Garlic is usually<BR>
&gt;&gt; the one recommended. Most non-liquid garlic, including Kyolic powders<BR>
&gt;&gt; have non SCD allowed stuff added to it! I use a lot of Kyolic Liq.<BR>
&gt;&gt; Garlic and notice a difference when I forget to take it or when I<BR>
&gt;&gt; travel and forget it at home. The Liquid can be hidden in foodstuffs<BR>
&gt;&gt; to, or put in capsules for your son. Raw garlic in caps is also very<BR>
&gt;&gt; effective and cheap! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; His stomach is distended and hard like a balloon, even though he is<BR>
&gt;&gt; very<BR>
&gt;&gt; thin. My other kids have soft stomachs/abdomens. Would this be an<BR>
&gt;&gt; indication<BR>
&gt;&gt; of yeast or bad bacteria or both?? [Pat Sullivan] Yes, from<BR>
&gt;&gt; everything I have read. This is common symptom of major dysbiosis<BR>
&gt;&gt; including candida, bacteria and parasites all of which both garlic and<BR>
&gt;&gt; olive leaf extract deals with. I use both! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; I KNOW my son is not autistic, he has incredibly bad dysbiosis due to<BR>
&gt;&gt; yeast,<BR>
&gt;&gt; bacteria, or, some research is showing, the MMR vaccine invading the<BR>
&gt;&gt; lymph<BR>
&gt;&gt; nodes of the colon and damaging it. In any case, I need to get to the<BR>
&gt;&gt; bottom<BR>
&gt;&gt; of this dysbiosis. Soil based organisms are also curing Crohns<BR>
&gt;&gt; disease, so<BR>
&gt;&gt; my friend in Washington State said. [Pat Sullivan] Go with it! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; In case you guys did not know this, the so called &quot;autism&quot; diagnosis<BR>
&gt;&gt; is<BR>
&gt;&gt; absolutely booming, some say as a result of very early and very<BR>
&gt;&gt; intensive<BR>
&gt;&gt; vaccinations., which disrupt the normal immune system,which then<BR>
&gt;&gt; predispose<BR>
&gt;&gt; the baby to infections, which lead to antibiotics, which lead to<BR>
&gt;&gt; dysbiosis,<BR>
&gt;&gt; which leads to toxins in the blood affecting the brain, etc. [Pat<BR>
&gt;&gt; Sullivan] Great desciption. Our kids are being hurt at a very early<BR>
&gt;&gt; age. Consider the tremendous increase in ADD which also usually<BR>
&gt;&gt; responds very well to Diet and dysbiosis treatment! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; If anyone has any advice, I am kind of desperate, my son is stimming<BR>
&gt;&gt; (obsessing) on fans again.<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; Could my giving him calcium lactate have screwed up the diet enough to<BR>
&gt;&gt; make<BR>
&gt;&gt; him worse?? [Pat Sullivan] Absolutely! Lactose is very bad! DON'T<BR>
&gt;&gt; beat yourself up over it though. You did not know and now can quickly<BR>
&gt;&gt; get back on track. Mistakes are part of the process of learning! <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;	[Pat Sullivan] <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;	Moria, just out of curiosity, does your son have any mercury<BR>
&gt;amalgams??<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; What happened to the article on dysbiosis, is it coming?<BR>

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;Dear SCDers,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have continued doing a lot of research on mercury amalgams and the<BR>
&gt;possible affect that it may be having on my own health problems. The<BR>
&gt;following are some results and thoughts about this that may be of<BR>
&gt;interest to you.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1.) I have had a hair mineral analysis done showing very high levels of<BR>
&gt;mercury in my system.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2.) I have had what is called a DPMS mercury challenge test confirming<BR>
&gt;once again that I have a very high level of Hg in my body.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;3.) I had my amalgams out over 10 years ago. The doctor who tested me<BR>
&gt;said that unless I have done a very determined &quot;detox&quot;, that mercury<BR>
&gt;exits the body very slowly.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;4.) It is likely that my consistent eating of fish (it is supposed to be<BR>
&gt;healthy and is, except for proven high levels of mercury) has continued<BR>
&gt;to regularly expose me to Hg keeping my levels very high in spite of<BR>
&gt;having my amalgams out.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;5.) There is no question that all amalgams leech Hg beginning the day<BR>
&gt;they are put in! Many, many (hundreds)of well documented studies on<BR>
&gt;this.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;6.) There are 2 very new studies, one done at the University of<BR>
&gt;Kentucky, clearly linking mercury amalgams to Alzheimers disease and<BR>
&gt;another done showing that intestinal bacteria exposed to Hg readily<BR>
&gt;develop resistance to antibiotics. It is felt by many researchers that<BR>
&gt;the heavy use of mercury amalgams is more responsible for antibiotic<BR>
&gt;resistance than is the over usage of antibiotics themselves.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;7.) Almost everything I read talks about mercury's affinity for the GI<BR>
&gt;tract and is considered as a causative agent in many GI tract diseases.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;8.) Hg also has a high affinity for the brain, kidney and liver and is<BR>
&gt;considered to be the most toxic metal of all the heavy metals! It is a<BR>
&gt;very strong immune depressant allowing for other opportunistic<BR>
&gt;infections to have a field day.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;9.) When I did the survey here a few weeks ago, 100% of us had amlagams,<BR>
&gt;or used to have them. Only about 60-70% of the general population have<BR>
&gt;amalgams in their mouth. Statistically then, THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;9.) I am NOT saying that amalgams are the cause of all our GI problems!<BR>
&gt;I am saying that this research is interesting and perhaps worth<BR>
&gt;considering for those of you who have not considered it before.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;10.) As I have mentioned before, Root Canals can be even more<BR>
&gt;devastating than mercury amalgams.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;11.) It is interesting to me that Elaine says in her book that she nor<BR>
&gt;anyone else knows exactly what starts the &quot;Vicious Cycle&quot; that we all<BR>
&gt;are treating so effectively with SCD. Is it possible that mercury is<BR>
&gt;one possible agent that starts it? Statistically, the growth of GI<BR>
&gt;diseases mirrors the growth in the usage of mercury amalgams. The same<BR>
&gt;is true with the growth of virtually all auto-immune diseases especially<BR>
&gt;MS, Lupus, Arthritis. When Hg gets into a cell the immune system<BR>
&gt;recognizes it as something foreign and then attacks it. If there is a<BR>
&gt;lot of Hg in the cells of the intestinal tract and the immune system no<BR>
&gt;longer recognizes it as &quot;self&quot; does it then attack it thus causing<BR>
&gt;damage to the GI tract as in &quot;leaky gut&quot; etc. This is just a theory,<BR>
&gt;but not one that I have developed all on my own. There is lots of<BR>
&gt;research suggesting what I say here.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I am not trying to push anything on anyone, simply trying to inform for<BR>
&gt;your further consideration!<BR>

&gt;thanks for the info. I might suggest that you use a brand of fish oil<BR>
&gt;that is labeled as containing no mercury. Usually ones that say<BR>

&gt;&gt; I have CD, three fistulas that had minds of their own and have been<BR>
&gt;&gt; following the SCD since March/97. I have continued pressure from my<BR>
&gt;&gt; GI to begin 6-MP therapy for the closure of fistulas. I refuse and<BR>
&gt;&gt; this drives him nuts :-) In my research on this drug and it's<BR>
&gt;&gt; successes for fistula closure I concluded that it works in approx. 50%<BR>
&gt;&gt; of the cases...not good enough for me...the 'Drug Chicken' Hehehe. I<BR>
&gt;&gt; continue to decline 6-MP.<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; In my personal experience, fistula activity begins when my <BR>
&gt;&gt; prostaglandin levels drop to nil. ( a woman thing ). I studied<BR>
&gt;&gt; prostaglandin and low and behold it is a cortisone like hormone<BR>
&gt;&gt; secreted from the the body to contol inflammation of the bodies<BR>
&gt;&gt; organs. This finding led me to an 'alternative' source of cortisone.<BR>
&gt;&gt; I tried Cat's claw.....nothing...tried Androsone.....nothing....tried<BR>
&gt;&gt; veggie juicing.....nothing....read a study on the use of Omega 3 fatty<BR>
&gt;&gt; acids ( Fish oil and Flax oil are good sources) as an assistant to the<BR>
&gt;&gt; bodies *natural* abilities to fight inflamation........Bingo!, eight<BR>
&gt;&gt; hours after trying plain ol' cheap brand fish oil I had a huge energy<BR>
&gt;&gt; increase. I did this last June and played around with the dosages and<BR>
&gt;&gt; as I continued the usage I also found the Omegas 3 acted well as<BR>
&gt;&gt; Prednisone would and the fistulas began to settle down.. <BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; I use 4000mg of deep sea cold pressed Fish Oil per day when fistulas<BR>
&gt;&gt; are not active, when they start to open up I immediately up the dose<BR>
&gt;&gt; to 6000mg per day and they settle down in two days. ( This dosage<BR>
&gt;&gt; suits *MY* height, weight, age and other lifestyle factors )<BR>
&gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt;&gt; In conclusion ( geez, I sound like a Professor of something-or-other!<BR>
&gt;&gt; ...I'm not...just a Mom with CD that is frightened of chemical drugs)<BR>
&gt;&gt; I know the fish oil did not *cure* the fistula, but I like having some<BR>
&gt;&gt; contol over the little buggers just the same. And in the long run the<BR>
&gt;&gt; toxins of 6-MP will not be in me to interfere in other ways.<BR>

I find it hard to define a fistula because of the many kinds and <BR>
because I can't create a mental picture of what they look like. Oh <BR>
well, here goes:<BR>
<BR>
A commonality of Crohn's is the spontaneous creation of fistulas. It <BR>
begins with a 'tract' that leads from the bowel wall, into the body <BR>
cavity and maturing until it connects with either another organ <BR>
(bowel, bladder, vagina) or out to the skin. There can be drainage <BR>
of an infectious nature, body fluid, blood or fecal matter depending <BR>
on the size and/or location of it. And as Monica stated, they are very <BR>
painful. Can anyone add more to this?<BR>

I noticed your comment on gaining back your weight. I lost only a few pounds<BR>
when I first started the diet (had been on celiac diet, so this was not a<BR>

the honey desserts and watch the cheese intake. Anyone else notice too much<BR>
weight gain? Also, yesterday was not a good day and I never got to cook<BR>
supper so we had chinese takeout! I was up at 4a.m. with diarrhea! I only<BR>
had steamed shrimp with veggies. It had no sugar, cornstarch, msg. or soy<BR>
sauce and it tasted very plain, But something bad had to be in there! I<BR>
think I'll starve next time. Take care, Jane<BR>

Dear Prateeska,<BR>
I probably should have warned you about the Lois Lang bread coming out of<BR>
the oven smelling like a pack of wet dogs! Once it cools down it loses<BR>
it's &quot;delightful aroma,&quot;and when toasted it smells fine. You are right<BR>
about not needing all 4 of the small loaf pans, just use as many as<BR>
needed to fill about 3/4 full. I now have 12 small pans and make large<BR>
batches of anything I bake, and freeze most of it. Also, just cook till<BR>
done, not brown. With the small loaf pans about 50 min at 340F. <BR>
This bread is not going to taste like the real thing, but it's not bad.<BR>
It gives you something to make a tuna, meatloaf or peanutbutter sandwich<BR>
with. The melted cheese is really good, and it can be topped with<BR>
avocado, thinnly sliced red onion, cilantro, tomatoes (vine ripened!) and<BR>
bacon, etc.Toast first, then top with cheese and melt. I usually spread a<BR>
little dijon mustard on the toast before melting the cheese. As I've<BR>
mentioned before this bread is best toasted. Untoasted it falls apart and<BR>
doesn't have much flavor. Even if I'm making a top and bottom sandwich,<BR>
I'll toast it first. <BR>

something that says Dry Curd Cottage Cheese in the refrig seciton, but it<BR>
also says contains 1/2% milkfat and looks like small curd cottage chess.<BR>
Is this what is ok to use?<BR>

Dear Lucy,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the helpful hints on the bread. I don't know exactly how long I<BR>
baked it, but I kept extending the time 'cause it wasn't brown so I figured<BR>
it wasn't &quot;done&quot;. Your comments help a lot. Thanks.<BR>
<BR>
I have noticed that when I talk about altering a recipe (don't do it often)<BR>
that I sometime overlook some of the things I do! I know in my head, but<BR>
to put down every little step I forget to do; and things when tried by my<BR>
fellow-SCD'ers don't come out the way I experience the altered recipe!!!<BR>
No wonder!!!<BR>
<BR>
So, I would like that each of us strive to be very thorough when we share<BR>
changes in a recipe so that when others try it, it works for them, too! We<BR>
each spend sooooo much time in the kitchen anyway, we don't need to spend<BR>
time with our hopes up about a recipe, make it, then find it to be a big<BR>
disappointment. I know Joan for one has found my zucchini bread muffins to<BR>
be a disaster for her while I continue to enjoy them made the way I do it.<BR>
So, this is an example of what I am talking about.<BR>
<BR>
For any inconvenience I have caused anyone with my &quot;overlooks&quot; I apologize.<BR>
Just still trying to get the hang of communicating recipes over the<BR>
internet!!!<BR>

we have to make sure we cover ALL ground on the mercury issue. NONE of my<BR>
hair analysis have showed levels of mercury YET there are cavitations worth<BR>
mentioning. People get confused and will go out and take a hair analysis test<BR>
and when it comes back negative (because metals DO NOT show up normally on<BR>
the first test at all, not to mention until you start mobilizing them), they<BR>
will think they don't have the problem or A problem. there are three things<BR>
that need to be addressed in the mercury-link: 1) mercury fillings (same as<BR>
silver fillings) 2) cavitations 3) root canals. If the whole issue isnt<BR>
addressed INCLUDING CHELATING IT OUT once it is removed, you cannot improve.<BR>
<BR>
mercury DOES NOT BELONG in the body and encourages cavitations and resistant<BR>
bacteria. why mess with it? im not even questioning tests - im just having<BR>
them removed.<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
I recently started tapering off prednisone for the first time in my life<BR>
(from 20mg down to 15mg for now) and I seem to be getting pretty bad<BR>
headaches almost every day. I was just wondering if this is normal and if<BR>
anyone knows when they might go away.<BR>

William,<BR>
I also noticed an increase in stool volume when I started the SCD. It seems<BR>
to have decreased back to normal volumes now although since I never paid as<BR>
much attention to my stool during the rest of my life as I have since being<BR>
diagnosed with SCD over 3 years ago, it's hard to say for sure if this is<BR>
the case.<BR>
I like to tell myself, since stool is about 50% bacteria, that the increase<BR>
is due to all the bacteria that are being killed off by the SCD, but I don't<BR>
know for sure if that is true.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

Studies have found that mucopolysaccharides (complex sugars found in<BR>
mucosal cells as well as plant cells, I believe) are probably healing to<BR>
IBD. Hoever, Elaine feels that aloe vera is &quot;no&quot; because it contains a<BR>
substance that is NOT good for you, and in my personal experience with it,<BR>
I agree.<BR>
<BR>
So yes to the first 2, no to aloe.<BR>

PARA-tuberculosis! Which I'd forgotten, and which (I just checked) is NOT<BR>
listed in my med. dictionary. So I don't know how much good the above info<BR>
really is? Well, ask your doctor, s/he'll probably have to look it up too,<BR>
so make sure she looks under the correct name ... PARA-tuberculosis.<BR>

I have had a problem with a swollen foot ever since I had surgery to<BR>
remove some of the my intestines and colon that was affected with<BR>
Chron's. I do not know why it is swollen. I have mentioned it to my<BR>
doctor and he really brushed it off. My foot hurts, especially on the<BR>
days I am on my feet a lot. Today it hurt almost all day (a burning<BR>
sensation). I plan on going to see another doctor about this, but I<BR>
was wandering if anyone else had this problem. Does anyone know why my<BR>
foot might be swollen or how I can eliminate this problem.<BR>

&quot;Don't hold back with the milk<BR>
=====================<BR>
Scientists in San Diego have found out that milk seems to prevent cancer in the<BR>
intestines.<BR>
Their research shows that among those men who drank two glasses of milk every<BR>
day, and who had done this for a longer period of years, less than a third were<BR>
having tendencies to develop cancer in colon, in comparison to those men who<BR>
had never drunk any milk.&quot;<BR>

&gt; Date: Monday, November 17, 1997 5:01 PM<BR>
&gt; 	Dear All, <BR>
  On the mercury testing , here is what I have learned<BR>
from a very knowledgeable friend . The hair testing for it is not very<BR>
accurate. A better test is called the Clifford Materials Reactivity Test.<BR>
This tests for materials used in dentistry and how you react to it<BR>
immunologically. The following is the information she shared with me.<BR>
<BR>
	The Clifford Materials Reactivity Testing program is based on serologic<BR>
precipitin procedures in microtiter environment for the detection of<BR>
systemic immunoglobulins.( IgG and IgM, with possible involvement of IgA)<BR>
against various offending chemical groups and families of compounds. These<BR>
chemical moieties are known to occur as corrosion byproducts, off- loading<BR>
or outgassing components and remnants of various restorative and prosthetic<BR>
materials as they break down in -vivo.<BR>
	The test kit can be ordered by calling 719 - 550 - 0008. All you need at<BR>
that point is a doctor or dentist address to have it sent to. When the kit<BR>
arrives you can have blood taken either by your doctor or at the local lab.<BR>
Special instructions about blood spinning have to be followed by the lab.<BR>
The blood work is sent overnight to the Clifford Consulting &amp; Research,<BR>
Inc. 3 days later you get the results.<BR>
<BR>
	The following is a list of things my friend showed a reaction to,<BR>
	   aluminum, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium,<BR>
cerium, chromium, formaldehyde, lanthanum, lead, manganese, mercury,<BR>
nickel, palladium, phenol, polyethimines, polyvinyls, rubidium, silver,<BR>
tannis and toluene. And then it showed a long list of materials that she<BR>
did not react to. <BR>
<BR>
	I have this on my list of things to do. If I recall correctly the cost is<BR>
around $125. On having them out you really need to be sure to have them<BR>
removed by a knowledgeable dentist or you can get in more trouble. You do<BR>
not want to replace them with yet another substance you would react to.<BR>
There are special procedures for removing the amalagam that prevent it from<BR>
flooding your system even more. Hope this helps.   <BR>
 <BR>
     Take Care,<BR>
       Kay<BR>

Here's a variation you might like and it's anything but light!<BR>
Instead of using a cup of Dry Curd Cottage Cheese I use two<BR>
bannanas. Then I put in a 1/4 cup of honey and 2 tablespoons of<BR>
rasins. That will make this taste like the banna bread that<BR>
my mother use to make. Those who try this I hope you like it.<BR>

&gt;Hi Tina,<BR>
 Re your headaches with prednisone tapering-last year melissa had the<BR>
worst ones of her 16 yr.old lfe when coming off pred.. She was on a very,<BR>
very slow tapering. Once the dosage was very low- 2.5-2 mg.alternating<BR>
days, they disappeared. We could track each headache with a dosage reduction.<BR>
 On another note, since you are in Canada as well, do you have a Bulk<BR>
Barn near? We were in Halifax recently and I cleaned them out of the ground<BR>
almonds-there was a special on -5.40/lb which was a low, low price for me to<BR>
pay. It's much more preferred by Melissa than the pecan meal.<BR>
 Hope this is of help---Cathy<BR>

How long have you been on the SCD diet? I thought that eventually most<BR>

Prateeksha, <BR>
Boy, you can't cheat on this diet! I don't even want to but incorporating<BR>
scd into the realities of everyday life situations takes planning and just<BR>
some getting use to it. When I go out I get plain fish and salad with oil &amp;<BR>
vinegar. It seems I can't trust anything else even if it sounds legal.<BR>
 Tomorrow we are taking our son to visit a college and the tour includes<BR>
food, but I'm packing my lunch! Occassions like this use to mean a break for<BR>
me from kitchen duty. Good thing I notice a difference because that makes it<BR>
worth all the effort. Take care, Jane<BR>

I just saw a message recommending a cheap source for the book Breaking the Vicious <BR>
Cycle. <BR>
<BR>
The book is available from many sources including just ordering it through your <BR>
neighborhood book store. Ordering through a book store will generally result in a cost <BR>
of $16.95 + tax. At a discount store it will be somewhat less.<BR>
<BR>
To contribute to helping people find out about the book and offer a mail order service, <BR>
I started the web site www.fwi.com/cmg/ This web site is solely supported by <BR>
revenues from selling the book and support from yours truly. I charge $16.95 + 3.50 <BR>
shipping and handling. This price was set at the same price that Elaine Gottschall was <BR>
charging (at the time) and I did not want to under cut her price. The web site has been <BR>
in existance for 1 1/2 years now and I have more money in it than it has returned (not <BR>
counting not paying anyone any wages).<BR>
<BR>
It would be appreciated that if you know someone who is interested in the book and would <BR>
like to find out more about it, the web site might be suggested. If there is a <BR>
financial problem, let me know and we will work it out.<BR>
<BR>
I do want to add, that the biography of Dr. Haas has been added to the web site.<BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I have been reading that a number of you have gained weight on this diet. I,<BR>
on the other hand, have lost almost 13 pounds ( from 120-something to 108-110<BR>
pounds) in a matter of 5-6 weeks. No celulite what-so-ever. I don't starve<BR>
myself, and eat lots of fattening stuff until I am full (none of which I used<BR>
to touch before in fear of gaining weight). Seems like eliminating starches<BR>
and sugar caused me to lose weight. I'm not complaning. No one outside this<BR>
diet believes I actually eat eggs, meat, butter, bacon, and nuts among<BR>
others, and yet be so skinny.<BR>

Another couple of questions as I begin this diet. <BR>
Elaine says to avoid the &quot;gourmet&quot; vinegars. Does anyone know if balsamic<BR>
vinegar is legal? The buyer at the store said there was no added sugar but<BR>
he wasn't sure if there was a yeast problem.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I found a fruit spread with no refined sugars, no pectin, etc., only<BR>
sweetened with juice concentrates. Would this be allowed?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to anyone who answers.<BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I noticed some exchange of recipe information on breads and muffins. I just<BR>
started eating nuts and nut flour without problems, so I made some cookies<BR>
 (with lots of raisins and walnuts instead of pecans). I can't believe, they<BR>
taste almost identical to oatmeal cookies. They're the best cookies I have<BR>
EVER eaten ( other than chocolate-chip. Yum.). Life on SCD is not so bad<BR>
afterall.<BR>

Hi Prateeksha -<BR>
<BR>
were the small loaf pans you used metal? i WILL NOT use aluminum or metal. i<BR>
use glass. also, what i do with ANY bread i do not like is french toast it<BR>
and put nut butters on it. i just keep the bread in refrigerator and its a<BR>
great snack<BR>

I know its really tough for a lot of people, but OTC medications are still<BR>
bad for you. I have not taken anything for colds (including fever<BR>
reducers) for over 4 years. Last time I was seriously sick I had a 103<BR>
degree temperature and just rode it out. I was on my feet by the next day.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
Colds are the bodies way of eliminating wastes and poisons from your body<BR>
-- at least that's what the alternative people say. <BR>
<BR>
I strongly feel that from my experience, OTC medication is a scam, and I<BR>
swear it makes the symptoms last longer. Also, the last time I thought I<BR>
needed something like an antibiotic, my doctor wouldn't give it to me. He<BR>
said that there where studies that showed that there was no significant<BR>
difference in recovery times between antibiotics, echanatia (you know what<BR>
I'm trying to spell), and nothing. <BR>
<BR>
I agree though, the homeopathics are kind of a bummer. Maybe instead of<BR>
getting OTC (which are mixes that may or may not be right for you) a<BR>
homeopathic doctor that mixes their own might be better. The stuff I got<BR>
was in little hard pellets and they dropped so many drops in the bottle to<BR>
make the strength, but it was different from those instant dissolving<BR>
lactose type. Maybe they didn't have lactose -- I'm not sure, and I can't<BR>
find out now.<BR>
<BR>
I'm sorry I didn't directly answer your question. But using nothing, IS a<BR>
good substitute for OTCs. There are probably a few different remedies in<BR>
the health stores, but once again ingredients are going to be a problem. I<BR>
believe extract of euchlypis under the nose will clear out the sinuses in a<BR>
hurry -- that might be helpful for sinus problems anyway.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this isn't taken as a personal attack, this is a lifestyle issue we<BR>
all must decide on, and everyone should make an informed decision. <BR>
Hopefully someone will post reasons on why you should take OTCs.<BR>

Thanks to everyone who responded about the headaches I've been getting since<BR>
I started coming off prednisone. Even though I may not be able to get rid<BR>
of the headaches right away it's comforting to know what the cause of them<BR>
is. Today I actually feel a little bit better.<BR>

Cathy,<BR>
I didn't realize that the Bulk Barn was a cross Canada chain or I would have<BR>
let everyone know about the sale. I actually went last week and stocked up,<BR>
and then this week I just happened to walk into one in the Toronto area and<BR>
they had the ground almonds on for $4.50/lb. I couldn't believe it, so I<BR>
stocked up as much as I could. I usually buy the whole almonds for $4.99/lb<BR>
and grind them myself, but the cheapest I've been able to find the blanched,<BR>
ground almonds is $7.99/lb, so this sale was great.<BR>
<BR>

&gt; we have to make sure we cover ALL ground on the mercury issue. NONE of<BR>
&gt; my<BR>
&gt; hair analysis have showed levels of mercury YET there are cavitations<BR>
&gt; worth<BR>
&gt; mentioning. People get confused and will go out and take a hair<BR>
&gt; analysis test<BR>
&gt; and when it comes back negative (because metals DO NOT show up<BR>
&gt; normally on<BR>
&gt; the first test at all, not to mention until you start mobilizing<BR>
&gt; them), they<BR>
&gt; will think they don't have the problem or A problem. there are three<BR>
&gt; things<BR>
&gt; that need to be addressed in the mercury-link: 1) mercury fillings<BR>
&gt; (same as<BR>
&gt; silver fillings) 2) cavitations 3) root canals. If the whole issue<BR>
&gt; isnt<BR>
&gt; addressed INCLUDING CHELATING IT OUT once it is removed, you cannot<BR>
&gt; improve.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; mercury DOES NOT BELONG in the body and encourages cavitations and<BR>
&gt; resistant<BR>
&gt; bacteria. why mess with it? im not even questioning tests - im just<BR>
&gt; having<BR>
&gt; them removed.<BR>

Not really. I recommennd however that anyone wanting to do this they<BR>
follow the protocol recommended in Hal Huggins book. It's All in your<BR>
Head. There is a right way to do it, and definitely a wrong way. when<BR>
I had mine out 10 years ago I did not even know the correct way to do it<BR>
and it definitely has affected the slowness of getting Hg out of my<BR>
body!<BR>

&gt; &gt;Dear SCDers,<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;I have continued doing a lot of research on mercury amalgams and the<BR>
&gt; &gt;possible affect that it may be having on my own health problems. The<BR>
&gt; &gt;following are some results and thoughts about this that may be of<BR>
&gt; &gt;interest to you.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;1.) I have had a hair mineral analysis done showing very high levels<BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; &gt;mercury in my system.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;2.) I have had what is called a DPMS mercury challenge test<BR>
&gt; confirming<BR>
&gt; &gt;once again that I have a very high level of Hg in my body.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;3.) I had my amalgams out over 10 years ago. The doctor who tested<BR>
&gt; me<BR>
&gt; &gt;said that unless I have done a very determined &quot;detox&quot;, that mercury<BR>
&gt; &gt;exits the body very slowly.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;4.) It is likely that my consistent eating of fish (it is supposed to<BR>
&gt; be<BR>
&gt; &gt;healthy and is, except for proven high levels of mercury) has<BR>
&gt; continued<BR>
&gt; &gt;to regularly expose me to Hg keeping my levels very high in spite of<BR>
&gt; &gt;having my amalgams out.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;5.) There is no question that all amalgams leech Hg beginning the<BR>
&gt; day<BR>
&gt; &gt;they are put in! Many, many (hundreds)of well documented studies on<BR>
&gt; &gt;this.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;6.) There are 2 very new studies, one done at the University of<BR>
&gt; &gt;Kentucky, clearly linking mercury amalgams to Alzheimers disease and<BR>
&gt; &gt;another done showing that intestinal bacteria exposed to Hg readily<BR>
&gt; &gt;develop resistance to antibiotics. It is felt by many researchers<BR>
&gt; that<BR>
&gt; &gt;the heavy use of mercury amalgams is more responsible for antibiotic<BR>
&gt; &gt;resistance than is the over usage of antibiotics themselves.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;7.) Almost everything I read talks about mercury's affinity for the<BR>
&gt; GI<BR>
&gt; &gt;tract and is considered as a causative agent in many GI tract<BR>
&gt; diseases.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;8.) Hg also has a high affinity for the brain, kidney and liver and<BR>
&gt; is<BR>
&gt; &gt;considered to be the most toxic metal of all the heavy metals! It is<BR>
&gt; a<BR>
&gt; &gt;very strong immune depressant allowing for other opportunistic<BR>
&gt; &gt;infections to have a field day.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;9.) When I did the survey here a few weeks ago, 100% of us had<BR>
&gt; amlagams,<BR>
&gt; &gt;or used to have them. Only about 60-70% of the general population<BR>
&gt; have<BR>
&gt; &gt;amalgams in their mouth. Statistically then, THIS IS VERY<BR>
&gt; SIGNIFICANT!<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;9.) I am NOT saying that amalgams are the cause of all our GI<BR>
&gt; problems!<BR>
&gt; &gt;I am saying that this research is interesting and perhaps worth<BR>
&gt; &gt;considering for those of you who have not considered it before.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;10.) As I have mentioned before, Root Canals can be even more<BR>
&gt; &gt;devastating than mercury amalgams.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;11.) It is interesting to me that Elaine says in her book that she<BR>
&gt; nor<BR>
&gt; &gt;anyone else knows exactly what starts the &quot;Vicious Cycle&quot; that we all<BR>
&gt; &gt;are treating so effectively with SCD. Is it possible that mercury is<BR>
&gt; &gt;one possible agent that starts it? Statistically, the growth of GI<BR>
&gt; &gt;diseases mirrors the growth in the usage of mercury amalgams. The<BR>
&gt; same<BR>
&gt; &gt;is true with the growth of virtually all auto-immune diseases<BR>
&gt; especially<BR>
&gt; &gt;MS, Lupus, Arthritis. When Hg gets into a cell the immune system<BR>
&gt; &gt;recognizes it as something foreign and then attacks it. If there is<BR>
&gt; a<BR>
&gt; &gt;lot of Hg in the cells of the intestinal tract and the immune system<BR>
&gt; no<BR>
&gt; &gt;longer recognizes it as &quot;self&quot; does it then attack it thus causing<BR>
&gt; &gt;damage to the GI tract as in &quot;leaky gut&quot; etc. This is just a<BR>
&gt; theory,<BR>
&gt; &gt;but not one that I have developed all on my own. There is lots of<BR>
&gt; &gt;research suggesting what I say here.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;I am not trying to push anything on anyone, simply trying to inform<BR>
&gt; for<BR>
&gt; &gt;your further consideration!<BR>

&gt; &gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Pat,<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks SO MUCH for the info about calcium lactate, I read in<BR>
&gt; Elaine's<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; book<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that children/babies may need extra calcium, so I gave him this,<BR>
&gt; never<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; even<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; thinking about lactose! Thanks so much. [Pat Sullivan] Your<BR>
&gt; welcome! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I think now that you mention it she recommends calcium AEP in the<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; book, will<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; look for it. [Pat Sullivan] Actually, I don't see where she<BR>
&gt; mentions<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; AEP specifically. This is something I read elswhere and don't<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; remember where. <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I need some advice on vitamins/minerals. Should I get the vitamins<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; from<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Freeda, or is there a brand available at the health food store?<BR>
&gt; Also,<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; do<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; most of you find you need a B12 shot, as in the book she mentioned<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that some<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; people do need a boost of their B12. Does anyone have any brands of<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; calcium<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (AEP) that they recommend. [Pat Sullivan] Personally, I am<BR>
&gt; currently<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; using vitamins and minerals called Matrix which I get from Peak<BR>
&gt; Energy<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1-800-331-2303. Like Elaine recommends, these are low dosage but<BR>
&gt; are<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; supposed to be extremely well absorbed and are all in the &quot;active&quot;<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; forms, expecially the minerals. This company focuses on dealing<BR>
&gt; with<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Mercury Toxic individuals and thus they recommend very low dosages<BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; B12 since it is supposed to &quot;methylate&quot; mercury which in their<BR>
&gt; minds<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; is bad since methyl mercury is 50 - 100 times more toxic than<BR>
&gt; straight<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; mercury. I am not aware that I need more b12 as I have not been<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tested. <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; How do you know if you need a B12 shot? [Pat Sullivan] There are<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tests that a doctor can do to determine levels of b12 and whether<BR>
&gt; or<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; not you need injections. They also look for anemia as low b12 is<BR>
&gt; one<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the causes of anemia <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; As far as soil based and olive leaf extract, it was my<BR>
&gt; understanding<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Elaine was NOT for them. It was my feeling she was very strongly<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; against them. [Pat Sullivan] If so, it is not in her book and I<BR>
&gt; don't<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; remember reading it here. I've only been on this list for about 45<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; days so it could be previous to that.She obviously highly<BR>
&gt; recommends<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yoghurt which carries lots of these types of bacterias into the<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; intestinal tract. In my case, I still cannot yet tolerate Yoghurt<BR>
&gt; or<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; cheese and thus am missing out on this important element unless I<BR>
&gt; take<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; them in capsule or powder form, which I do.<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Some of the parents of autistic kids are having great results with<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; soil<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; based organisms, they replace the yeast and bad bacteria in the<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; intestine,<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; so I am very torn on this issue. My best friend up in Washington is<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; having<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; great results, as are others. She gave her son SBOs and then tested<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; his<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; urine and his yeast and bad bacteria were nearly gone. [Pat<BR>
&gt; Sullivan]<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I would go with this if I were you! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am wondering if our kids have had SO MANY antibiotics that they<BR>
&gt; may<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; need a<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; boost from the soil based to get rid of the dysbiosis, and then<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; MAINTAIN the<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; new flora with Elaine's diet. What does the List think? [Pat<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sullivan] I think you are correct and unless Elaine has a contrary<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; opinion I would go with what is working for others in the treatment<BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; your son. <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you think it is ok to give him some garlic, I tried some raw<BR>
&gt; garlic<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; myself and wow, talk about die off, I only took about half a clove<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; had<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; MAJOR die off the next day! [Pat Sullivan] Small amounts and then<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; gradually build up! Garlic is extremley effective as you<BR>
&gt; discovered.<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I would certainly recommend it for you but start slow and then<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; gradually add more! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I read in a book on garlic that aged garlic is better for candida,<BR>
&gt; do<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; you<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; know what kind to get? [Pat Sullivan] Kyolic Aged Garlic is<BR>
&gt; usually<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the one recommended. Most non-liquid garlic, including Kyolic<BR>
&gt; powders<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; have non SCD allowed stuff added to it! I use a lot of Kyolic Liq.<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Garlic and notice a difference when I forget to take it or when I<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; travel and forget it at home. The Liquid can be hidden in<BR>
&gt; foodstuffs<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to, or put in capsules for your son. Raw garlic in caps is also<BR>
&gt; very<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; effective and cheap! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; His stomach is distended and hard like a balloon, even though he is<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; very<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; thin. My other kids have soft stomachs/abdomens. Would this be an<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; indication<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of yeast or bad bacteria or both?? [Pat Sullivan] Yes, from<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; everything I have read. This is common symptom of major dysbiosis<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; including candida, bacteria and parasites all of which both garlic<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; olive leaf extract deals with. I use both! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I KNOW my son is not autistic, he has incredibly bad dysbiosis due<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; yeast,<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; bacteria, or, some research is showing, the MMR vaccine invading<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; lymph<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; nodes of the colon and damaging it. In any case, I need to get to<BR>
&gt; the<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; bottom<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of this dysbiosis. Soil based organisms are also curing Crohns<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; disease, so<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; my friend in Washington State said. [Pat Sullivan] Go with it! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; In case you guys did not know this, the so called &quot;autism&quot;<BR>
&gt; diagnosis<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; is<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; absolutely booming, some say as a result of very early and very<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; intensive<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; vaccinations., which disrupt the normal immune system,which then<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; predispose<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the baby to infections, which lead to antibiotics, which lead to<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; dysbiosis,<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; which leads to toxins in the blood affecting the brain, etc. [Pat<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sullivan] Great desciption. Our kids are being hurt at a very<BR>
&gt; early<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; age. Consider the tremendous increase in ADD which also usually<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; responds very well to Diet and dysbiosis treatment! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; If anyone has any advice, I am kind of desperate, my son is<BR>
&gt; stimming<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (obsessing) on fans again.<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Could my giving him calcium lactate have screwed up the diet enough<BR>
&gt; to<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; make<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; him worse?? [Pat Sullivan] Absolutely! Lactose is very bad!<BR>
&gt; DON'T<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; beat yourself up over it though. You did not know and now can<BR>
&gt; quickly<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; get back on track. Mistakes are part of the process of learning! <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;	[Pat Sullivan] <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;	Moria, just out of curiosity, does your son have any mercury<BR>
&gt; &gt;amalgams??<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; What happened to the article on dysbiosis, is it coming?<BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Again thanks,<BR>

&gt;I have had a problem with a swollen foot ever since I had surgery to<BR>
&gt;remove some of the my intestines and colon that was affected with<BR>
&gt;Chron's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There can be 3 reasons that I can think of:<BR>
<BR>
1) they hit a nerve during the surgery<BR>
2) they cut off some lymphatic pathways<BR>
3) (most likely) you're getting some trigger point referrals from muscular<BR>
trigger points that set themselves up while you were under (they tend to<BR>
manhandle &quot;dead&quot; patients plus put you into weird positions cause they<BR>
figure you can't feel it anyway! idiots!). Try to find a really<BR>
competent, experienced (perhaps by word of mouth) medically-trained massage<BR>
therapist who knows about trigger points as well as &quot;muscle energy&quot;<BR>
therapy; it'll be hard to find someone who knows both, but that's what I<BR>
see as your best option.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I do not know why it is swollen. <BR>
<BR>
The swelling can be either from lymph blockage, or from muscle spasm<BR>
(usually a muscle in the bum called the Piriformis). If you have trouble<BR>
sitting, or turning your leg in/out, then I'd get the muscle checked out<BR>
... BUT NOT by a doctor, they don't know f***-all about muscles &amp;<BR>
muscle-pain referrals, never mind knowing how to treat them. Osteopaths<BR>
might also be able to help, though I'm not sure how they work in your area.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I have mentioned it to my<BR>
&gt;doctor and he really brushed it off. <BR>
<BR>
That's their standard response when they don't have solutions. Wait for<BR>
his next response: &quot;It's all in your head, my dear&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;My foot hurts, especially on the<BR>
&gt;days I am on my feet a lot. Today it hurt almost all day (a burning<BR>
&gt;sensation). <BR>
<BR>
Yep, sounds more &amp; more like some back/bum muscle with referral and<BR>
possible nerve compression from the spasm. You need to find someone who<BR>
knows muscles, and gives GENTLE treatment. Let me reapeat that: GENTLE<BR>
treatment, not what you've been led to expect via Hollywood films. That's<BR>
why you need a &quot;muscle energy&quot; trained therapist.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;I plan on going to see another doctor about this, but I<BR>
&gt;was wandering if anyone else had this problem. Does anyone know why my<BR>
&gt;foot might be swollen or how I can eliminate this problem.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I hope that explaind it. All the best. If you can't dig up a competent<BR>
therapist, get a hold of &quot;90 Seconds to Muscle Pain Relief&quot; by Dale<BR>
Anderson MD or &quot;Osteopathic Self-Treatment&quot; by Leon Chaitow DO ... you'll<BR>
need to practice a bit what they teach you, but if you stick with it you<BR>
might be able to figure it out &amp; solve it yourself.<BR>

I use only yogurt instead of DCCC in making the famous Lois Lang nut bread<BR>
and I also reduce the honey to taste.... It works out great for me. But I<BR>
will try putting in two bananas nex time.. Banana nut bread taste sounds<BR>

&gt;Here's a variation you might like and it's anything but light!<BR>
&gt;Instead of using a cup of Dry Curd Cottage Cheese I use two<BR>
&gt;bannanas. Then I put in a 1/4 cup of honey and 2 tablespoons of<BR>
&gt;rasins. That will make this taste like the banna bread that<BR>
&gt;my mother use to make. Those who try this I hope you like it.<BR>

I was just reading a couple of posts having to do with aloe vera and<BR>
poly-saccharides, and now I'm wondering about a drink I've been getting<BR>
Matthew as a treat lately. I thought it was o.k, but now I'm not so sure.<BR>
Maybe someone can straighten me out. Odwalla makes a limeade type of drink<BR>
which is sweetened with agave. This is the cactus which is used to make<BR>
tequila and pulque. It is very sweet. As a matter of fact, the juice that,<BR>
when fermented, is the alchoholic drink pulque is called agua de miel, or<BR>
honey water. I've been assuming that the sweetness is from fructose, but<BR>
now I worried that it might be a more complex sugar. Does anyone know<BR>
anything about this?<BR>
Thanks,<BR>

Hi,<BR>

Some asked about what sort of bacteria Pro Symbioflor and SymbioLact <BR>
consist of, so I will list it here:<BR>
<BR>
SymbioLact Comp:<BR>
Lactobacillus acidophilus 5x10^8 bacteria<BR>
Lactobacillus casei 5x10^8 bacteria<BR>
Bifidobacterium bifidum 5x10^8 bacteria<BR>
Streptococcus lactis 5x10^8 bacteria<BR>
Daily dose 2x above.<BR>
Notice: No lactose.<BR>
<BR>
Pro Symbioflor:<BR>
Eschericha coli<BR>
Enterococcus faecalis<BR>
Total per ml: 1,5-4,5x10^7<BR>
Daily dose: 4x above<BR>
<BR>
Company Name: <BR>
SymbioPharm GmbH<BR>
D-35745 Herborn<BR>
Fax 02772/51268<BR>
<BR>
I am not sure why these bacteria works so good, but they certainly do <BR>
more for me than more than 1/2 year of 100% serios SCD did. <BR>

<BR>
Very normal! Please don't let it stop you. Just rest alot, don't push<BR>
yourself. They will eventually subside, along with all the nasty side<BR>
effects from the prednisone, and soon you will be back to your normal<BR>
self before you took the prednisone. I feel that the prednisone changed<BR>
me into a different person. After going through &quot;withdrawal&quot;<BR>
by tapering off, I have found my old self again!<BR>

Dear Pat, <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your response, I don't know how I missed it the first time, maybe<BR>
mercury brain fog.&lt;grin&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I think my son may have gotten mercury in utero, remember, I had cancer when<BR>
he was in utero. Also, I have lots of mercury amalgams in my molars.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, being on antibiotics for so long, and having dysbiosis for so long,<BR>
his body could not move out any toxic metals.<BR>
<BR>
Not only that, remember, we live next door to a neighbor who has been doing<BR>
heavy pesticide spraying every 2 weeks for the past 20 plus years, do<BR>
pesticides contain mercury??<BR>
<BR>
Would mercury toxicity cause his tactile defensiveness?? He can't stand it<BR>
if you touch his head, it is painful to him.<BR>
<BR>
I finally got the spraying stopped, after I told the neighbor my son had<BR>
seizures from it.<BR>

want to be losing weight. What can I add (to my diet) that will increase<BR>
weight gain. Any suggestions?<BR>

Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I have been reading that a number of you have gained weight on this diet. I,<BR>
on the other hand, have lost almost 13 pounds ( from 120-something to 108-110<BR>
pounds) in a matter of 5-6 weeks. No celulite what-so-ever. I don't starve<BR>
myself, and eat lots of fattening stuff until I am full (none of which I used<BR>
to touch before in fear of gaining weight). Seems like eliminating starches<BR>
and sugar caused me to lose weight. I'm not complaning. No one outside this<BR>
diet believes I actually eat eggs, meat, butter, bacon, and nuts among<BR>
others, and yet be so skinny.<BR>

hi,<BR>
<BR>
sounds like your'e in the ZONE, low levels of insulin (the key to un-locking fat)<BR>
are causing the weight loss, zone man barry sears recommends adding monosaturated fat<BR>
to your diet to prevent further weight loss, the dr's mary and dan eades recommend<BR>
adding carb's (favorable low glycemic carbs) until you start to gain weight, this is hard<BR>
to do when eating mostly meat\vegatables, according to all three, fat don't make<BR>
you fat. in fact JAMA just published an article that concluded that 30% fat<BR>
was better than lower levels of fat, its slow, but soon everyone will be eating<BR>
the way you are. (p.s. fat is supposed to slow the rate of entry of carb's into<BR>
the blood, thus keeping insulin low.)<BR>
<BR>
ted<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
   Dr. Robert Knopp and his colleagues took 444 male<BR>
   patients with high lipid levels and put them on<BR>
   various levels of fat, ranging from 30 percent to<BR>
   18 percent for a one-year period. Patients with<BR>
   both high cholesterol and high triglycerides did<BR>
   best on the 30-percent fat diet. More<BR>
   interestingly, the more aggressively the fat<BR>
   content of the diet was lowered, the worse the<BR>
   results became. On the lowest-fat diets,good<BR>
   cholesterol dropped and triglycerides increased.<BR>
   This is a good indication that insulin levels were<BR>
   becoming elevated. In addition, very low density<BR>
   cholesterol increased, and reduction of bad<BR>
   cholesterol decreased.<BR>
<BR>
   These results led Dr. Knopp to state, &igrave;these<BR>
   observations indicate that the extra effort of<BR>
   aggressive fat restriction may be not only less<BR>
   beneficial but also counterproductive, since<BR>
   elevated triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol<BR>
   levels are all cardiovascular risk predictors in<BR>
   their own right<BR>

Dear Mike,<BR>
<BR>
First 2 months on SCD I lost weight, about 15 pounds (5'3&quot;, that's a lot of<BR>
weight for me) ... but when I began to be able to expand what I was eating<BR>
(from the &quot;getting started on the diet&quot; diet, I slowly introduced muffins,<BR>
and cookies and supplemented 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whole milk to the<BR>
yogurt recipe; all this in addition to the cheesecake ( was eating from the<BR>
beginning of the diet) and I began to notice that I was putting on the<BR>
pounds I had lost.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I'm beginning to want to cut back the &quot;fat&quot; so that I won't gain anymore!<BR>
<BR>
But, I do love those pumpkin cookies, banana nut bread, nut muffins, honey<BR>
crisps...goodies that I feel are important ... they are such &quot;comfort&quot;<BR>
foods and I do sometimes feel &quot;deprived&quot; so it's nice to be able to eat<BR>
them...maybe I'll just cut down! Can you eat these &quot;comfort&quot; foods? If<BR>
you can, go for it and have a good time while you're at it!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Love, Prateeksha<BR>

My understanding is that there is something in the aloevera leaf that is a<BR>
purgative, i.e., causes diarrhea, even violently so. However, this<BR>
ingredient is removed in the juice that we get in the stores.<BR>
<BR>
There's a lot of controversy about aloe vera as to which preparations<BR>
really have those antiinflammatory ingredients in them. Some clinical<BR>
studies I've seen indicate helpfulness in IBD, but these weren't controlled<BR>
studies. Rumors are that there are controlled studies under way. The<BR>
company which is making the biggest claims for aloe vera -- Mannatech -- is<BR>
a grand royal pain-in-the-distal-colon to deal with, especially trying to<BR>

Mannatech was doing controlled studies last year for UC<BR>
patients. They quit the testing early on because none<BR>
of the patients were being helped. Their honesty caused<BR>
their stock to go down the tubes, at least at that time.<BR>
This was all in the newspapers, but I can't remember the<BR>
exact date.<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt; &gt; 	Dear All, <BR>
  On the mercury testing , here is what I have learned<BR>
 from a very knowledgeable friend . The hair testing for it is not very<BR>
 accurate. A better test is called the Clifford Materials Reactivity Test.<BR>
 This tests for materials used in dentistry and how you react to it<BR>
 immunologically. The following is the information she shared with me.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
well, you guys, its just like everything else. Huggins disagrees with<BR>
Clifford and Clifford disagrees with Huggins. just another circle. I had my<BR>
test done thru Huggins. My doctor doesnt trust this test so HE had me spend<BR>
MORE money (and by the way, the test is $225) to be tested by Clifford. well,<BR>
i dont play these games. i had two tests done and I AM TELLING MY DENTIST he<BR>
will use something compatible from BOTH tests. i am not coming back here ever<BR>
again in my life because i dont have the right material in my mouth and have<BR>
to spend MORE money on redoing them. they are ALL nuts.<BR>

Hi.<BR>
<BR>
I have had swelling in my feet for over 2 months. I never had any<BR>
surgeries, and I think I had CD for a couple of years (diagnosed 6 weeks<BR>
ago).<BR>
<BR>
My feet swell in the heel and the ball of the feet (usually under the 2nd<BR>
toe, along with the toe). It often burns much like wearing very tight high<BR>
heel shoes while running a 10K marathon (if you can imagine how that would<BR>
feel). The pain and swelling went away for a week or so, but as soon as I<BR>
did some extended walking, I became literally crippled again. <BR>
<BR>
My doctor told me it's due to CD, and I also read over and over that<BR>
arthritis is a syptom of CD. I don't know how similar this is to arthritis<BR>
since I never had arthritis. I didn't think 26-year olds had arthritis.<BR>
 Also, through blood tests, I tested negative for rheumatoric disease or<BR>
lupus. So it has to be the CD. Even Elaine agreed that arthirtis can and<BR>
often accompany IBD. Not everyone is afflicted with this blessed pain. But<BR>
what can I do? I refuse to take prescription NSAIDS. I just wait patiently.<BR>
 I have to, I can't go anywhere far.<BR>

Simone,<BR>
<BR>
The condition you describe with your feet, sounds very similar to a<BR>
condition called &quot;plantar fascitis&quot; (PF) The PF is a band of connective<BR>
tissue/muscle along the bottom of the foot. Like the string portion on a<BR>
bow (and arrow), It attaches form from the heel to the balls of the<BR>
feet. It can become inflamed and irritated by overuse, like in running<BR>
or other weight bearing exercise. It's quite common. It can be treated<BR>
by health care providers who are familiar with it (podiatrists,<BR>
chiropractors, and others)<BR>
<BR>
In other words, your condition, MAY BE UNRELATED to IBD.<BR>
