<BR>
Dear Partridge family,<BR>
<BR>
In response to your post:<BR>
&lt;&lt; 1)    Has anyone had a similar experience? where one day you are fine the<BR>
 next the symptoms are worse? (major flare-up)<BR>
<BR>
My son, after two years on the diet and no drugs, had a major flare - out of<BR>
the blue.  One day he was fine the next he was passing pure blood 4-5 times a<BR>
day.  I couldn't believe it! <BR>
 <BR>
 2)    If so, how long did it last?<BR>
 <BR>
The symptoms lasted for about a week to a week and a half.  He had cramps,<BR>
increased frequency, blood in stools and by itself, decreased appetite but no<BR>
nausea or mucus.<BR>
<BR>
 3)    Any comments on how long the mucus lasted?<BR>
<BR>
He did not have any mucus to speak of but then he never really had that<BR>
symptom to begin with.  By the way, my son is 13 and has Crohn's that affects<BR>
his entire digestive tract.<BR>
<BR>
 4)    Did anyone have to increase meds? or were they able to get over it<BR>
 without increase to the meds?<BR>
<BR>
Since he wasn't taking any meds at the time, and  hasn't taken any for at<BR>
least 1 1/2 years, we put him on 40 mg. of prednisone for a week and then<BR>
started weaning him down.  The doctor wants to do it really slowly, much more<BR>
slowly than other doctors I have dealt with, so I am using my own weaning<BR>
schedule and currently have him down to 5 mg./day.  So far so good, no<BR>
symptoms.  Now if we can get him completely off the drug with no symptoms we<BR>
will be doing great.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't change his SCD diet any during the flare, which may be an option<BR>
rather than going the drug route.  They were talking hospital if we didn't get<BR>
things under control so I went with the drugs to get a more immediate response<BR>
to avoid the hospital.  I also knew I would wean him down as quickly as<BR>
possible (and safe).  <BR>
<BR>
Although I'm not really sure what caused his flare, I think it may have been a<BR>
combination of a little cheating on the diet on our family vacation (although<BR>
we always stay where I have cooking facilities to try and stay as true the<BR>
diet as possible), school was starting the next week and his sister was moving<BR>
away from home to go to college, so maybe some stress there.<BR>
<BR>
Don't know if this helps any.  Hope Martine can overcome her flare and return<BR>
to a more normal SCD state.<BR>

Concerning relapses - I started the diet two Augusts ago, and<BR>
each of the last two winters during the flu season I had short<BR>
episodes of terrible flu-like attacks.  The main symptoms were<BR>
achiness, severe shaking, and a fever of 103.  The first year it was <BR>
accompanied by a couple of bouts of very black D and so my GI put <BR>
me in the hospital for a couple of days.  (With black D they fear <BR>
upper GI tract bleeding)  Nothing was ever found in both cases.  Each <BR>
time I hurried home from work and fell into bed and shook uncontrollably<BR>
in the fetal position.  If I had been feeling better I would have <BR>
laughed it was so severe!  After a few days I was fine again.<BR>
<BR>
I recall others with IBD have also reported this kind of flu.  I <BR>
certainly never had such attacks before getting UC in the first place.<BR>
