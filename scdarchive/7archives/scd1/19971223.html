<BR>
&gt;Can the yogurt be a coincidence that you had a migraine headache.  I would<BR>
&gt;try the diet without the yogurt for a couple of weeks and then try the<BR>
&gt;yogurt.  Hopefully it was a coincidence.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Good Luck!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Happy Holidays<BR>

Unfortunately, this wasn't a coincidence.  I didn't mention it but I tried<BR>
the 24 yogurt twice - same result, migraine.  I'm now trying an experiment -<BR>
making regular 4 hour yogurt then treating it with lactase drops to see if<BR>
this causes a headache.  If so, then I will conclude that it is something<BR>
about the Yogoumet brand of starter and will try something else as a<BR>
starter.  If it doesn't cause a headache, then I will conclude that it is<BR>
the long brewing time, and something about the yogurt being &quot;super-cultured&quot;<BR>
that caused the problem.  In this case, I'm not sure what else to try.   <BR>
Is there anyone else out there who has gotten a headache from the 24 hour<BR>
yogurt, but has no problem with lactose-free milk?  I'd be interested to<BR>
know how you dealt with the problem.  I'd sure like to be able to eat this<BR>
yogurt.  I know I need the Lactobacillus!!!!   <BR>
<BR>
It may be that I should try the diet without the yogurt, as you suggested,<BR>
for awhile and see if my system will heal enough to be able to tolerate the<BR>
yogurt later.<BR>

Hi Becky<BR>
<BR>
Sorry to hear of your migraine.<BR>
I have used the Yogormet on a few occations, but donot care for the =<BR>
taste of it.<BR>
For over four years I have used the &quot;rosell&quot; yogurt starter and find it =<BR>
smoother and more paletable.<BR>
I do like one litre of  1/2 and 1/2  to 2 litres of  2%  with a 1/2 =<BR>
package of starter, for a nice creamy and smooth yogurt.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;rosell&quot; is made in Montreal and sold throughout Canada as is the =<BR>
Yogourmet.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this will be of some benifit to you. When trying any new food I =<BR>
always try small amounts untill I see how it may effect the system.<BR>
<BR>
good luck to you and Seasons Greetings.<BR>
<BR>
William<BR>

My husband and I have consulted our doctor regarding the control of blood<BR>
sugar.  He recommends having protein with each meal - and about half as much<BR>
volume of carbs as of proteins, and then double the volume of protein in<BR>
veggies.  The protein is utilized more slowly than carbs and evens out blood<BR>
sugar levels, and the veggies give us vitamins and all that good stuff.<BR>
(Eating more carbs, such as fruit or juice, to raise blood sugar levels<BR>
helps in the moment, but keeps the cycle of uneven blood sugar going.)<BR>
<BR>
If your interested in learning more, check out the book &quot;Your Body Knows<BR>
Best&quot; by Ann Louise Gittleman, M.S.  I ordered it from a bookstore, but I<BR>
have seen it in health food stores also.<BR>

&gt;Yesterday I felt like I was almost going to faint - 3 times.  Same thing this<BR>
&gt;morning after I had eaten bananna and egg mixture topped with honey.  Could<BR>
&gt;this be low blood sugar?  Happen to anyone else?  Maybe I'm not eating enough<BR>
&gt;fruit or veggies, though of course I eat them, maybe just not enough?  Thanks<BR>

I tried the crock-pot on low and it got too hot to make the yogurt and it<BR>
was a total failure. Very few electrical appliances will go down to 100-110<BR>
degrees F. My daughter has an old wok that will so when I visit her, I use<BR>
it, otherwise, I make it in the oven using the light bulb and make 1 gallon<BR>
at a time; 2x/month.<BR>

I'm unsubscribing for a holiday week. Prateeksha<BR>

Today is one year to the day that I started the SCD Diet.  Lets see I<BR>
weighed 125lb, my waist was -27, my blood count was 5, I couldn't stop<BR>
going to the bathroom (average 10 times a day), I had no appetite, my<BR>
fistula was inflamed and bleeding, and my stomach was killing me.  I was on<BR>
medication;  Prednisone, Ciprofloxacin, Previcid, Flagyl, and Asacol.<BR>
<BR>
Today one year later!  My weight today is 176lb, my waist is now 33+, my<BR>
blood count is 12, I am going to the bathroom once maybe twice a day, my<BR>
appetite I just can't stop eating, my fistula it's like as if it's not even<BR>
there, and my stomach NO PAIN!  I am also not taking any medication only a<BR>
couple of vitamins.<BR>
<BR>
THANK GOD!<BR>
<BR>
This diet was one of the best things that happened to me.  I have had<BR>
Crohns for 71/2 years and not one day went by that I didn't have pain in my<BR>
gut. <BR>
<BR>
GOD BLESS EVERYONE!  I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday and a healthy<BR>
and happy New Year!<BR>
<BR>
PS  Thanks for each and everyone's support on this group and the previous 2<BR>
groups.<BR>

&gt;Hi! My name is Jim and I recently started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.<BR>
I am also taking medication. I &gt;believe the diet is helping me a great<BR>
deal. I gain weight every day. However, my gastroenterologist &gt;doesn't<BR>
believe in the diet, he believes in medication and surgery. My current<BR>
doctor [Dr. Hoffman] wrote &gt;the forward to the Elaine Gottschall book<BR>
&quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle.&quot; He said I was one of the top &gt;worst patients<BR>
he saw in 1996. <BR>
&gt;During the six months before the diet I experienced a lot of stress and<BR>
ate poorly. Since I started the &gt;diet (Christmas Eve) I have gained one<BR>
pound a day! I am 5'11 and weighed 158 pounds &gt;but after the flare up my<BR>
weight dropped to 125. My doctor said he cannot believe how quickly I am<BR>
&gt;recovering. I am also very surprised considering my health at the time. <BR>
&gt;He said he soon expects to see me drug free. He treats me holistically<BR>
while my gastroenterologist just &gt;gives me medication. I can't wait to get<BR>
off the medication, because I now believe you are what you eat. &gt;I am very<BR>
grateful to Elaine and my doctor (Dr. Hoffman). They are heaven sent. So<BR>
far 1997 is great!<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Thanks,<BR>

Dear Jim,<BR>
What a great letter at a time of year that I think gratitudes are<BR>
especially meaningful. Having been one of the blessed ones, I know exactly<BR>
how you feel when you reflect on life pre-SCD and today. To those still<BR>
struggling with IBD, I want you to know that there's a bunch of us cheering<BR>
you on and praying for your health. You are not alone, and in a disease<BR>
that is so damn solitary, this has to hold some weight.<BR>
As an update on my own struggle with IBD/smoking, for now I've had to<BR>
relinquish some power and give in to smoking. The day after I went back to<BR>
smoking, my bleeding stopped. This in no way means I encourage anyone to<BR>
smoke, but for me, the cessation of smoking must have caused some kind of<BR>
major trauma to my system. When I decide to try it again, I will remain on<BR>
the patch longer (maybe forever). While I was bleeding and went to the<BR>
patch, it didn't work because, I think I'd already caused too much damage<BR>
to return from, without just going back to smoking. I would be more careful<BR>
in the future. As much as I'd like to beleive that my mind is stronger than<BR>
my body, (as in, I can will my way back to health) I've once again been<BR>
proven wrong. UC has it's own agenda and as tough an old broad as I<BR>
consider myself to be, for now I'm just going to have to listen to my body<BR>
and give it what it wants.<BR>
I wish you all the most joyous and healthy of holidays and deeply hope that<BR>
1998 brings us all the love, health and peace that there is to be had.<BR>
Love, Rachel<BR>

&gt; &gt; To all my fellow Bowel Buddies,<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I've been on this diet since beginning of '95.  Strictly!!!!  I too have had<BR>
&gt; &gt; relapses.  I have been hosptialized twice since I started this diet with<BR>
&gt; &gt; severe flare ups of ulcerative colitis.  The diet has helped me, but I've<BR>
&gt; &gt; continued my search for a 'cure' as I continue eating the SCD, because<BR>
&gt; &gt; although it's helped it's not cured it.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I've had this disease for 14 years. I've researched health for as long as I've<BR>
&gt; &gt; been sick.  During my quest for my health I've  shared openly and generously<BR>
&gt; &gt; with people who have bowel disease anything I come across that is of some help<BR>
&gt; &gt; to me.   As I have with Elaine's Diet. I've shared it with many , many people.<BR>
&gt; &gt; I absolutely adore Elaine. Due to my support,  she has spoken many times in my<BR>
&gt; &gt; hometown . They always went over very well.  I too have done talks regarding<BR>
&gt; &gt; this diet and bowel disease as well.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; As my health continues to challenge me my search continues.  I thought I had<BR>
&gt; &gt; turned over every stone as far as diets go.  I thought Elaine's hit it right<BR>
&gt; &gt; on the head.  It's made so much sense.  But, I continued to suffer with flare<BR>
&gt; &gt; ups even after three years being on her diet very strictly.   I have had<BR>
&gt; &gt; allergy tests done and removed those foods from my diet as well.  I have been<BR>
&gt; &gt; under the care of a naturopath, etc.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Being sick has cost me thousands of dollars, aside from how it's affected my<BR>
&gt; &gt; quality of life and relationships with friends and family.  I want to healthy<BR>
&gt; &gt; so bad so I can live a normal, wonderful life like others are who are healthy.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; In June of 97, I was hospitalized again after trying to heal at homw for 5<BR>
&gt; &gt; months and for the life of me could not understand why I couldn't get better.<BR>
&gt; &gt; Then when I got out of the hospital I could not come down on the prednisone<BR>
&gt; &gt; without having the extreme symptoms come back.  I started to contemplate<BR>
&gt; &gt; surgery in Novermber because I was so sick of being sick and the side effects<BR>
&gt; &gt; of being on such high doses of steroids were just as bad as the disease<BR>
&gt; &gt; itself.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Then my prayers were answered...<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I came across someone who had 'cured' themself from this very disease,<BR>
&gt; &gt; ulceritive colitis,  and has been free of symptoms for over 8 years.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I checked into it and found others just like him who had 'cured' themselves of<BR>
&gt; &gt; the disease as well as chron's and other bowel diseases...with no relapses and<BR>
&gt; &gt; it's been years for them. Even colon cancer!!!   I was crying I was so excited<BR>
&gt; &gt; to hear this news.  It's been like a message from God for me.  There is light<BR>
&gt; &gt; at the end of this very dark tunnle after all.  I have been inspired to have<BR>
&gt; &gt; hope again.  I want to pass this on to you.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I am for the first time since June down to 5 mgs of prednisone and in two<BR>
&gt; &gt; weeks I plan to be off completely.  Previous to my switch in diet I had not<BR>
&gt; &gt; been able to reduce my dose of 60 mgs for 6 months.  I feel this new path is<BR>
&gt; &gt; helping me like never before.  I want to share it with those of you on this<BR>
&gt; &gt; board, but you'll have to write to me separately as It's too long to put on<BR>
&gt; &gt; this list.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I totally support people doing Elaine's diet if it's working for them on the<BR>
&gt; &gt; level they want.  But for those who are continuing  to get relapses or for<BR>
&gt; &gt; those who want to 'heal and cure' their disease ...I invite you to just check<BR>
&gt; &gt; this out.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I was going to wait a few months to share this info with you people.  I wanted<BR>
&gt; &gt; to be off the prednisone and doing REALLY well,  but I am getting better and<BR>
&gt; &gt; feel so much more vitality then I have in a year AND I'm getting bombarded<BR>
&gt; &gt; with e-mails from this list that people are suffering still and I feel selfish<BR>
&gt; &gt; keeping this info to myself.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I'm exploring as you all are and feel it only supportive of me to share this<BR>
&gt; &gt; with you.  I have not completely healed yet...but I am no longer feeing like<BR>
&gt; &gt; I'm going to have to face surgery.  And I have been in touch with those who<BR>
&gt; &gt; have healed completely and their teaching me how to do it.  That's good enough<BR>
&gt; &gt; for me to try it and pass on the good news!<BR>

Dear Val,<BR>
I have an appliance called a Chef's Pot model DCP6 made by Dazey. It has<BR>
variable thermostat that can be set between 0-400F. The lowest<BR>
temperature the control shows is 200F, so what I did was find 105F and<BR>
marked it on the control with a line. This thing holds 105F day or night,<BR>
and it makes up to a gallon. A good way to locate the proper temperature<BR>
is to fill the pot with water, adjust the control, and measure the water<BR>
a few hours later. I did this off and on for a day or two until I found<BR>
the exact temperature. <BR>
I'm really liking making a gallon all at once, since I go through that<BR>
much in about a week. <BR>
Good luck!<BR>
Lucy<BR>

This is regarding Partridge's question on where my Crohn's is (was) in<BR>
relation to my intestines.  It is (was) in my iliem.  Maybe you should try<BR>
to take away the cheese for a week or so.  If that doesn't help then bring<BR>
back the cheese for a week or so and see if there is any difference.  If<BR>
that doesn't help then try the yogurt in the same manner.  Quick question,<BR>
are you taking any fish oil or eating nuts? <BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>

This is in response to PI5DA.  I was in really bad shape pre SCD.  I think<BR>
that I was in such bad shape at the time that if I didn't take the<BR>
medications at that time I don't think I would have felt as good as quick<BR>
as I did.  I am not saying the diet didn't help, but everything I did at<BR>
the time helped.  I did not want to go on 6MP either.  My GI doctor wanted<BR>
me to go on the 6MP once I started feeling better.  I did nothing of the<BR>
sort instead I was taking away each medication slowly.  I am not telling<BR>
anyone to do the same.  I am the type of person who doesn't even like<BR>
taking aspirin.  I believe that you are what you eat.  Before I had all my<BR>
problems with Crohn's 7 1/2 years ago I was eating poorly &quot;Fast Food<BR>
Junky&quot;.  I now think that it contributed to bringing out my Crohn's.  Maybe<BR>
I am wrong for thinking that, but that is never the less the way I feel. <BR>
So, what I am saying take it one day at a time.  At this time your<BR>
arthritis is not as bad and you do feel better.  Not everyone is the same,<BR>
and it just may take a little help from the Pharmacist.<BR>
<BR>
 Good Luck!<BR>

Dear Becky,<BR>
<BR>
In time, the diet will help you re-balance the flora of your intestine. <BR>
Often, when there is a bacterial imbalance (or paracites) it will be<BR>
tough to build of your lactobaccilus count.  I know, I have been there<BR>
too.  Hang in there though.  By the way, my impression is that it is<BR>
hardly worth a migraine to get the lactobaccilus of yogurt if you do not<BR>
tolerate it.  In my opinion, you may as well continue with your<BR>
supplements.  There really is no big difference between the<BR>
lactobaccilus you get in good quality supplements or from fresh yogurt. <BR>
In time, you will probably better tolerate the yogurt, that's my guess.<BR>

 Dear All,<BR>
	This is just a thought for a holiday gift idea for someone who has<BR>
devoted her life to passing along a diet that has helped so very many of us<BR>
over the years. In speaking to Elaine yesterday, I came to realize how<BR>
important the feedback that trickles back to her about how those of us on<BR>
the diet are managing, is to her. I purpose that we all take a minute to<BR>
write a few words to Elaine about how the diet has impacted our lives. If<BR>
you don't have it her fax # it is (905) 349-3420. If you don't have access<BR>
to a fax and think that this is a good idea, send it to me &amp; I'll be happy<BR>
to fax it to her myself. Just a thought. Hope your holidays were all that<BR>
you hoped for.<BR>
Love, Rachel<BR>

Thank you for the information about CD location.  We have presently stopped<BR>
the cheese and yougurt to see if this will help - we will follow through on<BR>
the other suggestions.<BR>
<BR>
Martine was on 1000mg twice daily of fish oil.  (Norwegian Pure Salmon Oil)<BR>
it did not seem to overly help but she stopped it as she felt it wasa<BR>
contributing to the looseness.  She is also taking the nut flour in the<BR>

you can fax using win95 by clicking on the in box which brings up microsoft<BR>
exchange. then click on compose then on new fax.inthe next window you have to<BR>
set up the dialing properties if you never did before. after that is done<BR>
click next, in this window fill out who its to then their fax #, the rec list<BR>
is for other people who should rec it at the same # so leave that blank for<BR>
one person click next . in this window you can experiment later but for a<BR>
simple fax click generic and yes then click next. fill in the subject and in<BR>
the note field you can fill out a decent size message. this is a simple form<BR>
of fax. click next in this next window you can attatch a file such as a word<BR>
perfect document but you'll have to set other properties up and its to long to<BR>
explain. click finish and your modem will dial the fax # and the receiving fax<BR>
will recognize it as a fax. good luck hope i didnt miss anything important.<BR>

I have another question, are you drinking Apple Cider.  For some reason I<BR>
noticed that this helps whith forming stool, at least with me it does. <BR>
Grape juice doesn't do to much justice for me, but I still drink it.  I<BR>

After reading all the encouraging holiday messages, I couldn't<BR>
resist...I've been on the diet strictly since March of 1996.  On and off,<BR>
I've had mild relapses. The most troublesome aspects, profuse bleeding and<BR>
incredible urgency all day subsided quickly, and never returned.  I just<BR>
returned from Jamaica where I was working (bummer, yes, I know) long<BR>
hours, stuck in a (nice) hotel in Kingston for 11 days.  We were &quot;fed&quot; as<BR>
there were briefings all day which were catered.  I decided that this<BR>

&gt;After reading all the encouraging holiday messages, I couldn't<BR>
&gt;resist...I've been on the diet strictly since March of 1996.  On and off,<BR>
&gt;I've had mild relapses. The most troublesome aspects, profuse bleeding and<BR>
&gt;incredible urgency all day subsided quickly, and never returned.  I just<BR>
&gt;returned from Jamaica where I was working (bummer, yes, I know) long<BR>
&gt;hours, stuck in a (nice) hotel in Kingston for 11 days.  We were &quot;fed&quot; as<BR>
&gt;there were briefings all day which were catered.  I decided that this<BR>
&gt;would be my opportunity to tread lightly by reintroducing foods.  I<BR>
&gt;started out very SCD, fruits, veggies, meat, etc.. I broke down and had a<BR>
&gt;pasta salad.  I actually felf better the next day, which I attribute to<BR>

 Rachel.  In a message dated 97-12-26 17:42:08 EST, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt;  I purpose that we all take a minute to<BR>
 write a few words to Elaine about how the diet has impacted our lives. &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
 Rachel, What a nice idea. My wife has been on the diet for seven months. She<BR>
just mailed a letter to Elaine thanking her. This is a perspective from<BR>
someone who lives with a person who is so unfortunate to contact IBD. My  wife<BR>
finally found out what she had after a long bout with IBD, and finally making<BR>
that first trip to the doctor. Hearing those terrifying words &quot;NO<BR>
CURE!&quot;..........what a sinking feeling that had to be for her. It was for me<BR>
and I wasn't the one hearing those words. She has been through the whole<BR>
gambit,  the accidents...the cramps...the bleeding....the weight loss.....the<BR>
drugs...and more and more drugs....then the doctors next great words &quot; We<BR>
might need to start thing about surgery!&quot;  Then while surfing the net I came<BR>
upon the SCD home page. What a great surfing trip that turned out to be. My<BR>
wife bought Elaine's book. We printed and read everything on that page and<BR>
continue to do so. That  was seven months ago. It has taken most of that seven<BR>
months,  but the improvements are starting to show now!  She has finally been<BR>
able to leave the house without worrying about an accident. What a great<BR>
feeling that is for her, as well as myself. For all of those who live with the<BR>
IBD but don't have it, we can only imagine what it must be like for those of<BR>
you that do. I have a really good idea of how thankful those who used Elaine's<BR>
methods, if for no other reason than that glimmer of light at the end of the<BR>
tunnel. That little something to hang on to, in time of need. So for all of<BR>
you out there, remember there is always hope. If we lose hope we lose<BR>
everything. ~~~~To Elaine....from the love ones of IBD sufferers, especially<BR>
this one.... many many thanks to you and all your efforts to help those who<BR>
are in dire need ......A BIG HUG!!!!!!...........P.S. We all have a tendency<BR>
to overlook, telling those who we appreciate that we do... so here are two of<BR>
us telling you <BR>
  &quot;ELAINE, WE DO APPRECIATE YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
                                                                              <BR>

<BR>
 Hello again. Alpaslan Akpinar asked in response to my &quot;21 month report&quot;<BR>
wether or not I was taking any medications (or had been, I'm not sure, I<BR>
deleted that message already). I am posting to the group figuring this was<BR>
a general interest type thing.<BR>
<BR>
Right now, I am taking no medications. However, I smoke a half a pack of<BR>
cigarettes a day, which might have some effect. JAMA articles have<BR>
concluded that a much higher amount of nicotine is required to have some<BR>
effect. (For those of you who are unaware, there are people wearing<BR>
patches and others smoking like chimneys to alleviate their colitic<BR>
symptoms - some research has indicated a correlation, particularly<BR>
involving individuals who smoked and then quit. I smoke primarily for<BR>
pleasure, and justify it with this medical evidence &quot;hey, its GOOD for<BR>
me!) PS I don't really believe that substituting lung cancer for colon<BR>
cancer is such a great idea.<BR>
<BR>
In the past (pre-diet) I had taken enormous amounts of prednisone, which I<BR>
believe saved me from surgery on one hand but screwed up my metabolism<BR>
either by nature of the beast or poor advice from my GI, who had me stop<BR>
taking it cold at a level of 50mg.day, which left me reeling and listless<BR>
for a long time. I have also take rowasa suppositories, and asulphazaline<BR>
and asacol.  All of these were pretty much worthless to me.  The<BR>
prednisone was the only thing that reversed the profuse bleeding and<BR>
cramps and constant urgency.  I draw the analogy of a balloon with a<BR>
little hole in it.  The hole is the disease, the balloon is you, bouyant,<BR>
happy, bouncing along. Suddenly a hole!  The prednisone is like forcing<BR>
air into the balloon.  It keeps you bouyant, bounccing along, perhaps even<BR>
moreso than before. But the &quot;pressure&quot; makes the hole bigger, so when you<BR>
stop taking it, you're worse off than before, saggy and drawn out.  But <BR>
for me it was a necessay evil.  Upon discovering the diet, I was still<BR>
under the control of my GI, who still goes poker faced whenever I bring up<BR>
the diet. I haven't seen him but once since being on the diet (poor chap,<BR>
I hope he can still afford his club dues), due to a relapse. I took<BR>
prednisone and asacol again,  the prednisone brought the bleeding under<BR>
control, and I came into remission much quicker than ever before, which I <BR>
attribute to my time on the diet, and my being on the diet.Since then<BR>
I've had occasional streaks of blood in my stool which only recently went<BR>
away completely. They didn't worry me too much, as it had been<BR>
much worse before, and I no longer had any accompanying mucus<BR>
or the dreaded urgency.<BR>
<BR>
I expect to go the the GI once a year just to be scoped to verify that no<BR>
cancer cells are growing. But I believe that the scope is very damaging to<BR>
the lining of my colon, and well,  talk about vicious cycles! Shove a<BR>
stick up your poop-shoot, and I bet anyone will have some problems,<BR>
especially when they try to get around the bend of the transverse colon! I<BR>
also think that those magnesium or whatever they use in-them enemas are<BR>
also damaging to my colon. So, I avoid my GI like the plague, unless I'm<BR>
in a severe relapse. I believe that the diet works, takes time, but that<BR>
if your case is severe, it makes sense to speed up the process with<BR>
whatever works for you (for me it was the prednisone) until you reach a<BR>
level of remission that you can sustain with the diet.<BR>
<BR>
My initial perception of the diet was that it was a way to alleviate my<BR>
bothersome symptoms, since whenever I inadvertently cheated, I had<BR>
problems within 24 hours (even a cup of mild coffee or roasted<BR>
store-bought nuts would set me off). Months (and months) later, I started<BR>
to realise that I was getting better, even with a mild setback shy of a<BR>
relapse, I could see measurable progress, in my energy level, my state of<BR>
mind, I was (and am) doing alot more, all my fears of being in the wrong<BR>
place at the wrong time faded (ask me sometime about being in the middle<BR>
of the<BR>
Brooklyn bridge with about 100,000 othe people during the bridge's<BR>
bi-centenial and having a strong urge to go..).  Now, I can &quot;cheat,&quot; but<BR>
it isn't cheating, it's just reintroducing foods!  But I'm not getting<BR>
smug about it, in fact, I'm just experimenting litle by little. I still<BR>
think it's a bit premature.  I expect to start really experimenting (like<BR>
trying some ice cream or pizza) after March, which will be two years.  <BR>
<BR>
Bottom line - don't even bother &quot;testing the waters&quot; before a year and a<BR>
half if you had severe colitis at any point.<BR>
<BR>
Enough rambling...Please forgive the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; quality to<BR>
this posting. May all your yogurts be flavored....<BR>

hi <BR>
<BR>
the fish oil studies (the randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover) <BR>
that have i read have reported D in about 10% of patients, but the effective dose<BR>
is much much higher than the twice daily discusssed below. the range i have<BR>
seen reported as theraputic is about 4.5 grams of EPA (12-18 capsules daily)<BR>
the brand most used in studies has been either MAX-EPA or an enterically coated<BR>
capsule (not avaiable yet). i have also read where a woman having negative reaction<BR>
to predisone was given  i.v. EPA and it allowed her to rapidly wean herself from<BR>
the steriod, and in her case the oral EPA did not work, so the stuff does not<BR>
work in all cases, and some people have D, but some do get relief.<BR>
<BR>
so if you are looking for a benefit in fish oil 1000mg twice daily seems<BR>
too little to have any positive effect. i myself have used EPA to combat<BR>
severe consitpation, which is my particular IBD problem, i know i<BR>
have taken enough when the stool floats, which for me is about 10 1000mg<BR>
capsules a day. after i lost my excess weight (low carb diet)<BR>
i no longer need  the fish oil on a daily basis, but i still use it<BR>
occasionally.<BR>

it did not seem to overly help but she stopped it as she felt it wasa<BR>

A BIG Amen to what you said to Elaine.  I am the wife of someone who has UC,<BR>
and can totally relate to how you feel.  My husband has only been on the diet<BR>
for a couple of weeks, but we are also seeing results.  And he even cheats!<BR>
(Not much, though).  I am excited to think that there is a possibility that a<BR>
person can be cured of this dreadful disease.  We are praying for the best.  <BR>
<BR>
I am very encouraged by the letters that we are receiving.  I didn't realize<BR>
how many people do suffer from digestive disorders.  It's encouraging to know<BR>
that we are not an island, that there is support out there!  This has helped<BR>
my husband to hang in there with the diet, knowing that it is helping so many<BR>
people.<BR>

This is my story of 15 years with UC and with a particular focus on the<BR>
last 12 months on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.<BR>
<BR>
DIAGNOSE UC<BR>
I ( 33 years, male) was diagnosed with UC when I was 18 years old. At that<BR>
time I was a high school student and the first sign of the disease was more<BR>
frequent bowel movements. The next sign was passage of stool mixed with<BR>
blood. My doctor made some examinations and test and then gave me the<BR>
diagnose UC.<BR>
<BR>
MEDICATION<BR>
I was then put on 4x500 mg Salazopyrin  per day.  In periods in remission I<BR>
have been down on 2  x 500 mg. For app. the last 5 years I have been on<BR>
Pentasa 2-3 x 50 mg a day.<BR>
During flare-ups I have been medicated with preds.<BR>
<BR>
SYMPTOMS<BR>
Compared to many other who suffers from IBD I guess I am a lucky person. My<BR>
UC (proctitis) is located to the rectum. I used to have regularly flare-ups<BR>
twice a year. During flare-ups I had 1-3 more bowel movements per day,<BR>
never diarrhea. Flare-ups starts with a period with gas, then passage of<BR>
stools mixed with mucus and finally passage of stools mixed with blood and<BR>
mucus. I have had some minor joint pains.  All in all I have been able to<BR>
live a normal life. I have never been away from work because of my UC.<BR>
Still, the thought of having to eat medicine for 50 years did not attract<BR>
me to much. <BR>
<BR>
PREDS<BR>
My flare-ups have been harder to control for each year. The first years the<BR>
disease went in remission by itself. For the last years my doctor has<BR>
prescribed 15 - 30 mg prednisolon a day for periods of two weeks. My last<BR>
flare-up started in October 96 and ended in December. After two weeks on<BR>
the preds, my nose started bleeding. I guess for me the preds is the worst<BR>
aspect with the disease. During the last flare-up I also had some very<BR>
irritating itching which I never had before. <BR>
<BR>
BREAKING THE VICIOUS CYCLE<BR>
In October / November 96 I was searching the internet for more info about<BR>
UC and found a lot of interesting information. I also read about Elaine<BR>
Gottschall's book &quot;Breaking the vicious cycle&quot; and the Specific<BR>
Carbohydrate Diet. On a trip to the USA in December I found the book in a<BR>
bookstore. I decided to try the diet. Since I have had regularly flare-ups<BR>
2 times a year I decided to follow the diet for at least one year to see if<BR>
the diet had an effect and to be able to make a conclusion.  It couldn't<BR>
hurt, the diet seemed nutritious.<BR>
I started the diet in January 97 and have followed it for 12 months. I have<BR>
not had any flare-ups  since I started the diet. When I started the diet I<BR>
also decided to follow my medication (Pentasa) as normal. For some reason I<BR>
stopped eating drugs in April 97, so the last 9 months I have been without<BR>
drugs. (I do not recommend others to this without consulting a doctor)<BR>
<BR>
SIGNS OF UC<BR>
As I said, no flare-ups the last year but 3 -4 times I have felt this<BR>
itching but not as irritating as during the last flare-up. If this is<BR>
connected to my UC I don't know.  Three times I have noticed very small<BR>
amounts of blood in my stools. The next days there have been no visual<BR>
signs. No mucus and gas when during a &quot;normal&quot; flare-up.<BR>
<BR>
LIVING ON A DIET<BR>
I am very fond of food. Before starting the diet I ate almost all kinds of<BR>
food, and I could hardly imagine my self on a strict diet. My motivation<BR>
was high and I have been able to follow the diet without cheating to much.<BR>
Even the diet is hard to follow it was easier than I thought. <BR>
<BR>
CHEATING<BR>
I have not been on this diet without cheating. For those of you who know<BR>
the diet:<BR>
- I have been drinking beer occasionally.<BR>
- 1-2 times a month I have been eating small amounts of potatoes or rice.<BR>
(On restaurants)<BR>
- .....<BR>
<BR>
SEEING MY DOCTOR<BR>
Last time I had an appointment with my doctor was in September 96, two<BR>
weeks before my last flare-up. My next appointment was in September 97. I<BR>
did not look forward to telling him about the diet and particularly not to<BR>
tell him I had stopped taking my drugs. (He always tells me how important<BR>
it is to take them.)  Totally unexpected he reacted positively to the diet.<BR>
I lend him my copy of the book and a printout of Wolfgang Lutz's book<BR>
(found on Mik's Web page). After a couple of weeks he send me a letter<BR>
where he agreed with many of the conclusions and that refined sugar is a<BR>
greater danger to peoples health than fat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
CONCLUSIONS<BR>
I have now been on the diet for 12 months. 9 months without drugs. No<BR>
flare-ups.<BR>
Since all my previous flare-ups has been pretty regular (  twice a year) I<BR>
think there are reasons to believe that this diet has an effect on my<BR>
disease. Even though the diet is hard to follow I will continue the diet.<BR>
If I can manage to stay off drugs on this diet there is no doubt what I<BR>
want to do.<BR>
<BR>
WHAT NEXT<BR>
My next milestone will now be my next appointment with my doctor in April,<BR>
and I am looking forward to see him.<BR>
<BR>
Finally I wish you all a healthy and a happy new year.<BR>
<BR>
regards<BR>
Knut.<BR>

<BR>
Hi!<BR>
<BR>
I've been seeing a few messages where people mention that a symptom for<BR>
them is constipation, not D.  I have mostly constipation also.  I am<BR>
interested to know how common this is.  And why this is different than the<BR>
classic bloody D.?<BR>
<BR>
I was recently diagnosed with IBD, UC.  But reading up it really seems that<BR>
it is Chron's.  The affted areas are the rectum and the large intestine at<BR>
the far end where it meets the small intestinge.<BR>
<BR>
I have constipation, occassional bouts of D., occassional bouts of sever<BR>
pain, (sometimes with D and sometime without) and in the last two years<BR>
have also had rectal bleeding with the constipation and sometimes with just<BR>
gas in the morning (no BM till after the blood).  Recently, just after<BR>
diagnosis in late September I started on Rowasa suppositories and Dipentum.<BR>
I have stopped bleeding on the drugs, but still have constipation and<BR>
occassional fairly sever pain.  Will be starting the diet soon to see if<BR>
that helps.<BR>
<BR>
The doctor who diagnosed me is so far away, and with other factors, I<BR>
wanted to change doctors.  My new doctor wants to do yet another<BR>
colonoscopy because he doesn't believe I have IBD at all.  Why?  No bloody<BR>
D., &quot;the&quot; symptom of IBD.  He thinks it would be an infectious agent.  I<BR>
think I need some more information before I can sort all this out.<BR>
<BR>
Anybody?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
<BR>

Becky...Forgive me if I sound like I'm repeating myself, but I can't help but<BR>
mention again...check out the book &quot;YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER&quot;.  If you<BR>
can't afford it, have your library order it for you.  And please check out the<BR>
other site I mentioned...even it's it's just to educate yourself.  I believe<BR>
the address to subscribe is: list@rawtimes.com  or owner-list@rawtimes.com.<BR>
It's a great source of real good information on health issues.<BR>
<BR>
The Dr. specifically talks about constipation and colitis.  For now, Start<BR>
adding 2 glasses of water a day to your diet until you're drinking at least 8,<BR>
8 oz glasses &quot;at a minimum&quot; a day.  This would be distilled water only by the<BR>
way..and not in milky colored soft plastic bottles either, because of the<BR>
formaldhyde (spelling?)that leaks into the water from the plastic.  Does a<BR>
number on our hormones and other systems.  You can probably find distilled<BR>
water in your area to be delivered to your home in hard plastic 5 gallon jugs<BR>
that are blue in color. <BR>
 <BR>
You cannot substitute juices or other liquids for your pure water intake.  If<BR>
you're still constipated add two more glasses a day. But, get the book so<BR>
you'll understand the importance of water intake. <BR>
<BR>
The dr. says chronic dehydration is the cause of constipation and colitis and<BR>
many other diseases.   Your dehyrdration is not going to turn around suddenly<BR>
by now drowning yourself in water.  It will take a few months to turn it<BR>
around.  You must walk everyday as well if you don't now. At least 30-60<BR>
minutes a day.   <BR>
<BR>
Best wishes! colleen<BR>

Glenn, where can one purchase this oil?  Food grade or not?  I've heard emu<BR>
oil is a great carrier oil of other ingredients because it get absorbed into<BR>
the skin so well.  Why were you checking into it?<BR>

Dear Becky,<BR>
<BR>
Please let me know what you discover on this question.  My GI said that I<BR>
fell into his category patients with symptoms of unknown causes, of which,<BR>
he said, is 75% of his practice!<BR>
<BR>
I have D (among other symptoms which have been alleviated by the SCD), but<BR>
no blood.<BR>
The SCD has helped me immensely.  I hope you find some relief from your<BR>
symptoms, and help, too.<BR>
<BR>
To your good health.<BR>

I was checking into it at the recommendation of someone that I know. I was<BR>
looking for the food grade emu oil. Without FDA approval, there are no<BR>
sources that I know of in this country that I can get the oil from. However,<BR>
the cheapest source that I could find for the non food grade emu oil was in<BR>
Canada. I don't have the web site, but I found the site thru the Alta Vista<BR>
Search Engine. The owner was willing to sell a quart of the non food grade<BR>
emu oil for between $70-$90 depending on the type of oil I was looking for.<BR>
As I recall he was offering a massage oil, another oil that had a<BR>
mentholated quality for penetration (apparently a lot of professional<BR>
athletes use this type for their sports injuries), and another type for<BR>
applying to cuts, fever blisters, sun burns, and other skin ailments. I have<BR>
a small quantity that I use when I accidently cut myself. I found that the<BR>
oil adds a lot of moisture to the skin and promotes faster healing. If you<BR>
get some of the oil, you must keep it refridgerated or it looses its healing<BR>
qualities over time. I also found that the emu farmers that I communicated<BR>
with via email were more than willing to answer various questions.<BR>

I haven't read any of the books you mentioned, but the general theme that I<BR>
seem to pick-up on is that we must consume items that are untouched, or<BR>
rather uncontaminated, by the variety of chemicals that are used to grow<BR>
food or that contaminate the drinking water supply. If this is correct, I<BR>
suppose IBD problems in many people are caused by allergenic reactions to<BR>
the chemicals that are byproducts of man's wonderful technological<BR>
innovations?<BR>

&gt;Becky...Forgive me if I sound like I'm repeating myself, but I can't help<BR>
but<BR>
&gt;mention again...check out the book &quot;YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER&quot;.  If<BR>
you<BR>
&gt;can't afford it, have your library order it for you.  And please check out<BR>
the<BR>
&gt;other site I mentioned...even it's it's just to educate yourself.  I<BR>
believe<BR>
&gt;the address to subscribe is: list@rawtimes.com  or owner-list@rawtimes.com.<BR>
&gt;It's a great source of real good information on health issues.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The Dr. specifically talks about constipation and colitis.  For now, Start<BR>
&gt;adding 2 glasses of water a day to your diet until you're drinking at least<BR>
8,<BR>
&gt;8 oz glasses &quot;at a minimum&quot; a day.  This would be distilled water only by<BR>
the<BR>
&gt;way..and not in milky colored soft plastic bottles either, because of the<BR>
&gt;formaldhyde (spelling?)that leaks into the water from the plastic.  Does a<BR>
&gt;number on our hormones and other systems.  You can probably find distilled<BR>
&gt;water in your area to be delivered to your home in hard plastic 5 gallon<BR>
jugs<BR>
&gt;that are blue in color.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You cannot substitute juices or other liquids for your pure water intake.<BR>
If<BR>
&gt;you're still constipated add two more glasses a day. But, get the book so<BR>
&gt;you'll understand the importance of water intake.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The dr. says chronic dehydration is the cause of constipation and colitis<BR>
and<BR>
&gt;many other diseases.   Your dehyrdration is not going to turn around<BR>
suddenly<BR>
&gt;by now drowning yourself in water.  It will take a few months to turn it<BR>
&gt;around.  You must walk everyday as well if you don't now. At least 30-60<BR>
&gt;minutes a day.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Best wishes! colleen<BR>

In a message dated 97-12-31 19:06:23 EST, you write:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Becky,<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; My new doctor wants to do yet another<BR>
 colonoscopy because he doesn't believe I have IBD at all.  Why?  No bloody<BR>
 D., &quot;the&quot; symptom of IBD.  He thinks it would be an infectious agent.  I<BR>
 think I need some more information before I can sort all this out.<BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Can I tell you that aside from chronic &quot;D&quot; and bloating/gas I didn't have ANY<BR>
Crohn's symptoms (except for some surgeries that failed to heal completely<BR>
-which got my doctor suspicious) ?!  I had a colonoscopy 3 months ago that<BR>
showed 7 ulcerations in the large colon.  A definite Chron's.  But I never had<BR>
so far any bleeding or fever or weight loss (classic symptoms).  I lost weight<BR>
on the SCD diet, but that's different.  I now experience abdominal pains due<BR>
to muscle spasms, and the chronic D is still there.  Still no bleeding.  So<BR>
just because I didn't have the classic by the book symptoms, it didn't mean<BR>
that I didn't have CD.<BR>
<BR>
So, if you ever have another colonoscopy, bring a video tape with you like I<BR>
did. They can tape the procedure.  I have the whole lovely experience<BR>
documented. <BR>
No one can argue with the visuals.<BR>
<BR>
Take care, and I wish you well.<BR>
<BR>
Simone<BR>

Hi Becky<BR>
In response to your E-mail ... I too have problems with constipation,<BR>
flatulence (in particular the last few days of my cycle), allergies/food<BR>
intolerances which cause bloating, and I have a colapsed rectum. I <BR>
never have D - to me having D sounds like heaven! I have not been<BR>
diagnosed as having IBD or UC but went on the diet about 2-3 months ago<BR>
in the hope that it would clear up my allergies/food<BR>
intolerances/hypoglycaemia to a long list of foods ... corn, dairy<BR>
products, yeast, potatoes. Other foods which used to cause me discomfort<BR>
were nuts and dried fruit but I seem to be able to eat them now.<BR>
I cannot eat the yoghurt or cheeses on the SCD list which makes it more<BR>
difficult to find things to eat, also I am eating a lot more meat than I<BR>
used to and I am not totally comfortable with the idea of eating more<BR>
meat as I was 'semi-vegetarian'!<BR>
<BR>
In some ways I feel better, C is not such a problem though occasionally<BR>
I have bleeding with a bowel movement (which happens more often than<BR>
when I was not on the diet!) but it is early days on the diet and I am<BR>
beginning to feel more comfortable with it and less inclined to risk<BR>
breaking it.<BR>
<BR>
I am hoping to try the Pro-Symbioflor and Pro-Symbiolact that someone<BR>
on SCT-list recommended ... if I can get hold of it ... I think I may<BR>
have to get it mailed from the UK.<BR>
Good luck - hope you are feeling better soon.<BR>
ISABELLA.<BR>

&gt; Hi!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I've been seeing a few messages where people mention that a symptom for<BR>
&gt; them is constipation, not D.  I have mostly constipation also.  I am<BR>
&gt; interested to know how common this is.  And why this is different than the<BR>
&gt; classic bloody D.?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I was recently diagnosed with IBD, UC.  But reading up it really seems that<BR>
&gt; it is Chron's.  The affted areas are the rectum and the large intestine at<BR>
&gt; the far end where it meets the small intestinge.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have constipation, occassional bouts of D., occassional bouts of sever<BR>
&gt; pain, (sometimes with D and sometime without) and in the last two years<BR>
&gt; have also had rectal bleeding with the constipation and sometimes with just<BR>
&gt; gas in the morning (no BM till after the blood).  Recently, just after<BR>
&gt; diagnosis in late September I started on Rowasa suppositories and Dipentum.<BR>
&gt; I have stopped bleeding on the drugs, but still have constipation and<BR>
&gt; occassional fairly sever pain.  Will be starting the diet soon to see if<BR>
&gt; that helps.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The doctor who diagnosed me is so far away, and with other factors, I<BR>
&gt; wanted to change doctors.  My new doctor wants to do yet another<BR>
&gt; colonoscopy because he doesn't believe I have IBD at all.  Why?  No bloody<BR>
&gt; D., &quot;the&quot; symptom of IBD.  He thinks it would be an infectious agent.  I<BR>
&gt; think I need some more information before I can sort all this out.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Anybody?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Becky<BR>
&gt; in Concord, CA<BR>
