Dear Prateeksha,<BR>
I don't honestly remember, but I've ordered both pecan &amp; almond flour<BR>
(had<BR>
much better success baking with the almond flour) from this company and<BR>
was<BR>
very happy with their product.<BR>

In a message dated 97-08-26 02:38:25 EDT, you write:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; i assume that when you follow the SCD diet one must taper off the <BR>
 ASACOL, and that it is done without the help/advice of a doctor. &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
No.  This is not necessary.  Do not take your son off his medicine.  <BR>
<BR>
You can try the SCD and take the asacol.  There is no reason not to.<BR>
<BR>
You may have gotten this impression by the discussion of the fact that<BR>
asacol<BR>
has a lactose base.  It really doesn't add up to that much lactose.  I<BR>
wouldn't worry about it unless your son is lactose intolerant and then<BR>
you<BR>
should work with the doctor on some alternative medication.<BR>
<BR>
If your son shows dramatic improvement on the diet even your physician<BR>
will<BR>
probably take him off the asacol eventually.  There is no reason related<BR>
to<BR>
the diet to reduce his dosage prematurely.  <BR>
<BR>
I take 9 asacols a day and am trying the diet.  I'm sure there are<BR>
others on<BR>
this list who take asacol and are on the diet (I've only been on it a<BR>
short<BR>
time, maybe others can chime in with their success doing both?)<BR>
<BR>
Trying the diet is a great idea, but it is not something you substitute<BR>
for<BR>
his current medication.  If he's only been diagnosed since August 11th,<BR>
it is<BR>
too soon to know how well the asacol and/or the diet is working for him.<BR>
 Give it some time.<BR>
<BR>
On page 46 of Elaine Gottshall's book it says &quot;The diet should be<BR>
discussed<BR>
with your physician.  Medication should continue as the physician has<BR>
instructed.  As progress is made, the physician, undoubtedly, will<BR>
reduce<BR>
medication gradually.  WARNING:  There are very specific procedures by<BR>
which<BR>
certain medications are reduced and it can be dangerous to discontinue<BR>
their<BR>
use improperly.  Always seek medical advice in reducing medication.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I hope this helps.  <BR>

&gt; &gt;Dear Rachel,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; It seems to me about two weeks ago or so I read that Elaine does not<BR>
&gt; recommend this nut company as a source for nut flour, although it is<BR>
&gt; given<BR>
&gt; in the book as a source.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Is this correct?  In going over my notes, I noticed this and I just<BR>
&gt; ordered<BR>
&gt; 30 lbs. of pecan flour which has already been shipped!!!!!  Is there<BR>
&gt; forbidden filler in their pecan flour?<BR>
<BR>
No one has done any analysis on it.  I've been using their pecan meal<BR>
with no problems for almost a year, practically daily!<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; I have 30 lbs. pecan flour ordered!  Yipes...what is &quot;much better<BR>
&gt; success<BR>
&gt; baking with almond flour than pecan flour&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
IMHO, almond flour tastes better (not that pecan meal doesn't taste<BR>
good) and baked goods &quot;rise&quot; better with almond flour, which is less<BR>
&quot;greasy&quot; or dense/wet/whatever.  BUT.... When you compare the price of<BR>
the two, pecan meal starts to taste much better, and, necessity being<BR>
the mother of invention, I have learned to alter my recipes such that my<BR>
muffins come out very good with pecan meal.  If money were no object,<BR>
I'd probably go 75% of the time with almond meal.  But, as I find with<BR>
most of this diet, it is very cost prohibitive.  I really wish I could<BR>
eat something affordable like rice or potatoes, (Yes, I know beans are<BR>
cheap, but they can give me enough gas to fuel a rocket ship). So I eat<BR>
pecan meal to save money. My last two (and only) 30lb boxes of nut flour<BR>
were pecan meal.  I am now going to get out the ol' credit card and go<BR>
for the pecan meal because, in the words of Stewart Smalley, &quot;I'm worth<BR>
it!&quot;  (If you don't know who he is, well, he was a character on Saturday<BR>
Night Live).<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Prateeksha<BR>
Dear Prateeksha,<BR>
I ordered the pecan flour first (also 30 lbs). The taste is good but I<BR>
found breads, muffins, baked stuff to be kind of mushy and wet. The<BR>
almond<BR>
flour was closer in making these consistansies to &quot;regular&quot; baked goods.<BR>
I<BR>
have a decent sized freezer so I keep both flours in little baggies and<BR>
fill each one with 3 cups of flour. Hope this helps.<BR>

Okay guys!  I need counsel on the SCD carrot cake recipe.  I made it in<BR>
a<BR>
bread pan and it rose up to the top of the pan.  I took it out at 45<BR>
mins<BR>
because it was already very brown.  I set it aside to cool and it fell. <BR>
When<BR>
I cut it, the texture was more like bread pudding than cake (but the<BR>
flavor<BR>
was good).  I'm pretty sure I measured everything right.  Some<BR>
questions...<BR>
<BR>
1.  I have a kitchenaid mixer (a very powerful machine capable of<BR>
pulverizing<BR>
anything!)  I'm wondering if I overmixed the batter?  (I vaguely<BR>
remember<BR>
that quick breads shouldn't be overmixed--like pancakes they're supposed<BR>
to<BR>
be a bit lumpy to rise correctly?)<BR>
<BR>
2.  I used a regular oven but I also have a convection oven.  Has anyone<BR>
found that using a convection oven produces better baking results with<BR>
the<BR>
almond flour?<BR>
<BR>
3.  I was pretty casual about measuring the grated carrots.  (I grated 3<BR>
large carrots and the amount looked about right).  Is precision<BR>
important<BR>
with regard to the carrots??<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to your input.  I'm just glad I did have any witnesses<BR>
tonight! (I often have friends over for supper)<BR>

Greetings All!<BR>
I'm very glad there is someone to talk to about the SCD. I am getting<BR>
ready to begin it on Sept. 1. I've had Crohn's for 16 years and have<BR>
undergone all the usual: 3 surgeries, temporary ostomy,numerous drug<BR>
trials,etc. <BR>
<BR>
My husband, a software engineer &amp; avid Netsurfer found the SCD for me<BR>
and proposed I try it. I was very skeptical. After all, when I'm really<BR>
ill the only thing I can stomach is bread &amp; potatoes! But, after reading<BR>
testimonials &amp; other info from the Web Library, I'm going to try it. I<BR>
have a few questions which I'm sure you've heard before. (I did look at<BR>
a lot of lists to find the answers first.)<BR>
<BR>
 First, the introductory diet, the one you follow for the first 5 days,<BR>
lists:Eggs(boiled,poached,or scrambled) as breakfast food along w/dry<BR>
cottage cheese &amp; gelatin yet, earlier in the book she states &quot;When brisk<BR>
diarrhea is no longer present, egg may be added to the diet.&quot; Which is<BR>
it?<BR>
<BR>
 2nd, I'm having difficuly finding a yogurt maker. Will a crock pot work<BR>
as well?<BR>
<BR>
 3rd, is it possible to one day go back to eating potatoes, bread, etc.<BR>
or is that a highly individual thing?<BR>
<BR>
 Lastly, some questions on allowable foods: Mushrooms? Cooking oil<BR>
sprays? Shortening? Since wine and vinegar are permitted, how about the<BR>
wine vinegars(red,white,champagne)?<BR>
<BR>
 I am very nervous &amp; anxious about this change in life, but, hopeful.<BR>
Thanks for all the support all ready.<BR>

Ellen,  when I made the carrot cake it came out just like you said. It<BR>
sure<BR>
wasn't cake, but I kept it in the refidgerator, and it was more like<BR>
eating<BR>
orange-carrot fudge. Great with applesauce on it.<BR>
<BR>
For those of you new to all this: hang in there, it really works.<BR>

About the yogurt.  First, I found that it is a wonderful &quot;comfort food&quot;<BR>
for<BR>
taking the place of cravings for bread and cookies.  Sounds strange, but<BR>
that's how it worked for me.<BR>
<BR>
Second, I found (from advice from another SCDer) that the easiest and<BR>
cheapest yogurt maker is my oven.  I experimented by turning on the oven<BR>
light for several hours, leaving a thermometer in.  When it gets up to a<BR>
stable temperature, I read the temp and adjusted a crack in the oven<BR>
door<BR>
til I got in the 100 to 110 degree F range (a sponge in the door worked<BR>
best for me).  Of course, this means that the oven is unavailable for at<BR>
least 24 hours.  I try to turn on the light several hours before the<BR>
yogurt<BR>
is ready to &quot;bake&quot;.<BR>

Hi!<BR>
I have been on the diet for six months and i am not sure about the first<BR>
question <BR>
<BR>
&gt;First, the introductory diet, the one you follow for the first 5 days,<BR>
&gt;lists:Eggs(boiled,poached,or scrambled) as breakfast food along w/dry<BR>
&gt;cottage cheese &amp; gelatin yet, earlier in the book she states &quot;When<BR>
brisk<BR>
&gt;diarrhea is no longer present, egg may be added to the diet.&quot; Which is<BR>
&gt;it?<BR>
but for your second question we began to use a crock pot to make the<BR>
yogart<BR>
and it was very hard because you had trouble telling the temp.  We found<BR>
a<BR>
yogart maker in a kitchen appliance catolog.  I can't find it this<BR>
minute but<BR>
i will keep looking.  Our machine is called Donvier Yogurt Maker<BR>
Electronic.<BR>
<BR>
The book does say you will be able to go back to eating normal<BR>
foods...just<BR>
not alot.  It means we could never going back to eating potato for every<BR>
meal<BR>
or to use sweet 'n low instead of sugar stuff like that.<BR>
<BR>
lastly, some medicines say you can not use alcohol which some sprays<BR>
have in<BR>

Dear Bill,<BR>
If you do want real cake type consistency, try cooking the carrot cake<BR>
at<BR>
315F. This way it gets a chance to cook all the way through and set up.<BR>
If<BR>
the batter seems a little runny, add an extra 1/2 cup almond flour. I<BR>
also<BR>
found it turns out plenty sweet with less than the 3/4 cup of honey. <BR>
Cooking a little longer at a lower temperature also keeps whatever you<BR>
are<BR>
baking from falling. <BR>
Has your energy improved?<BR>

&gt; Ellen,  when I made the carrot cake it came out just like you said. It<BR>
sure<BR>
&gt; wasn't cake, but I kept it in the refidgerator, and it was more like<BR>
eating<BR>
&gt; orange-carrot fudge. Great with applesauce on it.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; For those of you new to all this: hang in there, it really works.<BR>

  We found a<BR>
&gt;yogart maker in a kitchen appliance catolog.  I can't find it this<BR>
minute but<BR>
&gt;i will keep looking.  Our machine is called Donvier Yogurt Maker<BR>
Electronic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Williams-Sonoma Mail Order Catalog 1-800-541-2233 August edition, page<BR>
44,<BR>
Standard (without timer) $30 (set of 8 glasses) Extra glasses (8) $14.<BR>
Don't get the one with the timer (only goes up to 14 hours).  I made<BR>
this<BR>
mistake so I have to remember to reset it before it goes off!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Also, I have used the heating pad...like the texture of the yogurt best<BR>
with this; however, the last batch I &quot;burned&quot; because the pad got too<BR>
hot<BR>
and &quot;scorched&quot; the yogurt!  You have to really watch it; I keep a<BR>
thermometer on it while the yogurt is &quot;baking&quot; and check  it<BR>
periodically.<BR>
<BR>
Tried the crockpot; didn't work.  Also tried a warming tray; didn't<BR>
work,<BR>
because there was no thermostat.<BR>
<BR>
I think the gas oven would be great!  Don't have one myself.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, Prateeksha<BR>

Dear Debbie,<BR>
<BR>
When I started the diet I tried various ways of making yogurt, but it<BR>
was too<BR>
much of a hassle.  Sometimes it doesn't work out with these makeshift<BR>
methods<BR>
like the crockpot or oven or heating pad because the temperature does<BR>
fluctuate<BR>
over the 24 hour period, and this is no good.  I found that the easiest<BR>
and<BR>
best thing to do was buy an electric yogurt maker.  At first I had no<BR>
idea<BR>
where to get them and everywhere I looked they didn't have any.  I was<BR>
frustrated, and was just &quot;doing without&quot; the yogurt.  Then I met a girl<BR>
who<BR>
also has CD and is on the SCD and she told me where she bought hers at a<BR>
local<BR>
drug store, so I went there and found it.  It was so exciting to finally<BR>
have<BR>
one and be able to make yogurt, I was beaming with joy.  Anyway, with<BR>
yogurt<BR>
makers you will get a perfect outcome every time, and you will be<BR>
thrilled with<BR>
the result.  I did some searching on the net a while back and found that<BR>
you<BR>
can order a yogurt maker through the mail for a relatively cheap amount<BR>
(about<BR>
$25 including shipping charges).<BR>
Check this site:<BR>
http://www.salton-maxim.com/healthyalt/funfoods.html<BR>
<BR>
They used to also sell them at this home shopping site, but I just<BR>
checked and<BR>
they are no longer listing yogurt makers.  You could always phone to<BR>
make sure.<BR>
 I think it used to be a little cheaper here:<BR>
<BR>
http://www.qvc.com/scripts/detail.dll?Product&amp;K33326<BR>
<BR>
The main site for the above is:<BR>
http://www.qvc.com/depart.html<BR>
<BR>
About the eggs, I personally have always found eggs to be very<BR>
agreeable, even<BR>
when I have diarrhea.  Eggs have been a mainstay for me, always being<BR>
something<BR>
I CAN eat.  I think if the diarrhea is really bad, you may want to avoid<BR>
them<BR>
for a while, but otherwise, you can include them and see if you can<BR>
tolerate<BR>
them.  A lot of this diet is trial and error, so sometimes it good to<BR>
only eat<BR>
one thing at a time and see if you get an adverse reaction within the<BR>
next few<BR>
hours.  If not, you can keep eating it, if so, you can leave it out for<BR>
a while<BR>
and try again a few weeks later.<BR>
<BR>
Shortening should be ok, as it is pure fat, to the best of my knowledge,<BR>
but I<BR>
recommend using butter or oils instead.  Avoid cooking sprays because we<BR>
don't<BR>
really know what's in them and you don't really need them anyway.  Just<BR>
butter<BR>
or oil your pans.  Mushrooms are allowed, but not canned.  Use fresh. <BR>
The<BR>
gourmet vinegars you talked about may be ok, but I don't know if they<BR>
would<BR>
contain more sugar than plain vinegar.  I suspect they might, because<BR>
they are<BR>
a little sweet tasting, and sweet wines for example are not allowed. <BR>
This<BR>
would be a question for Elaine if nobody else on this list knows for<BR>
certain.<BR>
<BR>
According to the book, yes, it is possible to go back to eating potatoes<BR>
and<BR>
bread one day, but it will always be in moderation I think.  Personally,<BR>
I went<BR>
into such a good remission from the diet after about 8 months that I<BR>
went off<BR>
of it and started eating normal foods again.  I had no adverse symptoms<BR>
whatsoever for about 3 or 4 months, when finally I had a flare up.  I<BR>
went back<BR>
on the diet right away and was able to get the flare under control<BR>
WITHOUT<BR>
prednisone in 2 months.  I believe if I had remained on the diet longer,<BR>
like<BR>
at least 2 years straight, and then, if I only ate the occasional starch<BR>
or<BR>
sugar (instead of tons), I would have had a better chance of actually<BR>
being<BR>
&quot;cured&quot; from the diet.  There has been debate about this subject of<BR>
whether the<BR>
SCD can actually cure you or if it can only control the disease as long<BR>
as<BR>
you're on it.  According to Elaine, the author of the book, it cured her<BR>
daughter, and a few other people have reported being cured.  In my heart<BR>
somehow I still believe it can cure, but that it takes time and is<BR>
different<BR>
for everyone.  That's why Elaine says in the book that we should stay on<BR>
it for<BR>
at least one year after every symptom has disappeared (I think that's<BR>
what it<BR>
says).  Anyway, I hope this helps, and feel free to ask anything on this<BR>
list. <BR>
We are here to help each other.<BR>

I used to make yogurt with an electric heating pad.  I put several<BR>
layers<BR>
of toweling on top, had it on low, and used a corningware casserole<BR>
dish,<BR>
covered.  I think it was OK, but I was never sure if the temp. was maybe<BR>
too warm at the bottom of the dish.<BR>
<BR>
So, I got a Yogourmet brand 2-qt. yogurt maker.  I realized it was<BR>
getting<BR>
a little out of the temp. range because having to keep it on for 24 hrs.<BR>
My solution:  I got a timer, and now I start it out and leave it on for<BR>
the<BR>
first several hours, and then adjust the timer so that it is on two<BR>
hours,<BR>
and off one hour, on two hours, off one hour until the 24 plus hours are<BR>
up.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe we are being too paranoid, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.<BR>

Dear Anna,<BR>
I have a Donvier ice cream maker, and as far as I'm concerned, it is the<BR>
was to go. It has a thick walled metal tub that you put in the freezer<BR>
for<BR>
at least 8 hours before using. The way you make the ice cream is to pour<BR>
the  mixed ingredients into the tub, and give the handle 3 turns every 3<BR>
min. for about 20 min.  It comes in a pint or quart size.<BR>

I have been using a special spritzer thing for oil that works great in<BR>
place of those non-stick aerosol sprays.  I got mine from a tupper wear<BR>

Dear Anna,<BR>
I tried an electric ice cream maker and although it made great regular<BR>
ice<BR>
cream for my husband, I wasn't crazy about the frozen yogurt I got. Also<BR>
with the amount of ice and salt you have to use and the time it took to<BR>
make make it, I found it a real pain in the butt. You asked for<BR>
experiences<BR>
and this was mine, sorry.<BR>

Dear Anna and Rachel,<BR>
The Donvier is not an electric ice cream maker and does not require any<BR>
salt or ice. It really is EASY to use.  I usually make a real basic<BR>
vanilla<BR>
recipe: 2 cups yogurt, 1/4 cup honey (more if you like things sweeter)<BR>
11/2<BR>
tsp vanilla and a dash of salt. I have found that if you make a full<BR>
quart<BR>
at a time it doesn't set up as well. So the way to avoid that problem is<BR>
to<BR>
not make more than about 3 cups at once.<BR>
Good yogurt cream is possible!<BR>

&gt; Dear Anna,<BR>
&gt; I have a Donvier ice cream maker, and as far as I'm concerned, it is<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; was to go. It has a thick walled metal tub that you put in the freezer<BR>
for<BR>
&gt; at least 8 hours before using. The way you make the ice cream is to<BR>
pour<BR>
&gt; the  mixed ingredients into the tub, and give the handle 3 turns every<BR>
3<BR>
&gt; min. for about 20 min.  It comes in a pint or quart size.<BR>

Hello ALL,<BR>
 <BR>
 Thanks so much for all the answers I received. I have a question for<BR>
Anna. She says she makes her own sour cream.<BR>
<BR>
 I've read the directions and only have 2 questions: Do you put a lid on<BR>
the casserole dish that contains the sour cream mixture?<BR>
<BR>
 And, the yogurt stays at the proper temp without being directly<BR>
covered?<BR>
<BR>
 I love sour cream, so I'm going to try this soon!<BR>
<BR>
 Thanks,<BR>

Hi Group,<BR>
<BR>
Anna wrote ...<BR>
&lt;&lt; There has been debate about this subject of whether the SCD<BR>
    can actually cure you or if it can only control the disease as<BR>
    long as you're on it.  According to Elaine, the author of the<BR>
    book, it cured her daughter, and a few other people have<BR>
    reported being cured.  In my heart somehow I still believe it<BR>
    can cure, but that it takes time and is different for everyone.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
IMHO, let's be honest with ourselves, the SCD diet is not likely<BR>
to &quot;cure&quot; any of us.  Those of us who have dealt with CD/UC for<BR>
a long time (10+ years) have slowly gained knowledge as to what<BR>
we believe *caused* our disease.  In my case, I believe it to be<BR>
a genetic pre-disposition, combined with other 'life' factors <BR>
such as antibiotics and stress, and overuse of sugar foods,<BR>
to have reduced my immune system, thus allowing a susceptibility<BR>
(malabsorption) towards getting an IBD.<BR>
<BR>
Having been on a previous (non-SCD) strict diet for over two+ years,<BR>
I can certainly vouch (and therefore believe) that what we eat<BR>
contributes greatly to our IBD symptoms.  I am commited to the<BR>
SCD diet, and yet I know that it is unlikely that I will ever be<BR>
able to stop the diet (back to &quot;normal&quot; foods).  I truly believe<BR>
that my last operation was a direct cause of stopping<BR>
(ie: cheating too often) the diet.  After the operation *I chose*<BR>
not to start the SCD, and CD was manageable for two years.  I then<BR>
lost weight, more D. and night accidents, and the final straw was<BR>
my new GI saying he wanted to put me on nightly tube feedings.<BR>
This situation was no longer acceptable to me, and I certainly<BR>
did not want another operation.  *I chose* to start the SCD diet.<BR>
<BR>
So those who are on SCD a long time, the occasional use of<BR>
forbidden foods are tolerable.  Yet they continue to eat the<BR>
same way as on the SCD all other times.  I believe that Elaine's<BR>
daughter is not &quot;cured&quot; (don't get upset Rachel) of her UC, she<BR>
simply has no more symptoms to deal with (which is what we are all<BR>
aiming for, is it not ?).  I saw Elaine and her daughter on<BR>
&quot;Dini Petty Show&quot; (Canada) in fall '95.  Her daughter (in her '40s)<BR>
admitted that she still follows a SCD lifestyle (since she was 8).<BR>
This has become a way of life for her, and most likely to many of<BR>
us who continue the SCD lifestyle for many years to come (with<BR>
occasional cheating).  I for one, miss pasta and ice cream the most,<BR>
but spaghetti squash and later frozen yogurt will have to do for now.<BR>
<BR>
These are my opinions, and in no way meant to offend anyone.<BR>
 <BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Thanks for replying.  Do you use homemade yogurt to make frozen yogurt? <BR>
If so,<BR>
do you use yogurt made from 1/2 and 1/2 or just milk?  Do you add the<BR>
flavorings such as honey, or fruit after it's all done, or before you<BR>
put it in<BR>
the ice cream maker?  Isn't it kind of a hassle to have to turn it every<BR>
few<BR>
minutes?  Wouldn't an electric one be better?  Just wondering.<BR>

Hi Debbie,<BR>
Finally, a fellow sour cream lover!  You are the first one I've heard<BR>
from.  I<BR>
just made sour cream 2 days ago and it was ready last night.  I assume<BR>
you are<BR>
refferring to the directions I posted that are stored on the SCD Web<BR>
Library. <BR>
Since then I have perfected my method.<BR>
<BR>
Using buttermilk as a starter works, but I found this freeze dried<BR>
powdered<BR>
sour cream starter in the health food store where I buy my yogurt<BR>
starter. <BR>
It's Yogormet brand.  I've also used Rosell brand.  If you can find this<BR>
starter, it is well worth it.  It usually says &quot;Sour cream, buttermilk,<BR>
or<BR>
fresh cheese starter&quot; because you can use it to make any of the three. <BR>
I just<BR>
make sour cream.  <BR>
<BR>
To answer your questions, yes, you should always cover everything, be it<BR>
yogurt<BR>
or sour cream.  Put the lids, or plastic wrap on the yogurt containers,<BR>
and put<BR>
a lid or plastic wrap over the sour cream container.<BR>
<BR>
Here's what I do now.  I've got it down to a science.  I broke so many<BR>
of my<BR>
little glass jars that I discovered a cheap replacement.  Heinz large<BR>
baby food<BR>
jars fit in my Salton 7 glass yogurt maker perfectly.  I just bought a<BR>
whole<BR>
bunch, get my family to eat them (or buy the plain applesauce, which I<BR>
can<BR>
eat), and save the jars.  Now I have tons of jars so I can have a<BR>
continuous<BR>
rotation schedule for yogurt and sour cream making.  Anyway, here's what<BR>
I do. <BR>
I use 14 clean jars and lids, since my yogurt maker holds 7, and I do a<BR>
double<BR>
decker thing.<BR>
<BR>
Boil 3 litres half and half.  Cool to room temperature.<BR>
Divide in half, pouring into two pitchers with a spout (like juice<BR>
pitchers).<BR>
Get two cups or mugs and pour back about a cup or so of the milk from<BR>
each<BR>
pitcher into each mug.<BR>
Add the yogurt starter to one of the mugs of milk and the sour cream<BR>
starter to<BR>
the other.<BR>
Mix WELL, ensuring no grains or lumps remain.  I mix it at least 1 or 2<BR>
full<BR>
minutes.<BR>
Pour each of the mugs back into each of the pitchers.  Make sure you<BR>
note which<BR>
one is the yogurt and which one is the sour cream.<BR>
Mix the starter mixture into each pitcher thoroughly.<BR>
Pour the yogurt mixture into your jars.  Cover them and put in the<BR>
yogurt<BR>
maker. The yogurt has to go into the yogurt maker first.  The sour cream<BR>
goes<BR>
on top, allowing it to ferment at the required lower temperature.<BR>
Put a dinner plate on top of the yogurt jars.<BR>
Pour the sour cream mixture into your jars.  Cover them and place the<BR>
jars on<BR>
top of the dinner plate.<BR>
Cover the whole machine with a thick bath towel, wrapping it around and<BR>
snuggling it around like a tea cozy.  This holds in the heat.<BR>
Make sure it is plugged in.  Leave for 24 hours or more.<BR>
Remove jars and put in refrigerator.  Cool well, and enjoy!<BR>
I mark an &quot;S&quot; in magic marker on the lids of the sour cream jars, to<BR>
avoid<BR>
mixing them up.<BR>
<BR>
It may sound like a lot of steps, but it's really quite simple.  I hope<BR>
everyone tries it, and keep an eye out for that powdered starter.  It is<BR>
a<BR>
dream!  But if you can't find it, use buttermilk with no additives to<BR>
make sour<BR>
cream.  Any questions or problems, please ask again.  I wonder if anyone<BR>
else<BR>
on this list has tried making it yet.  I tell you, it's just as easy as<BR>
making<BR>
yogurt, and since you do it at the same time, it's like killing two<BR>
birds with<BR>
one stone and you get double the delicious outcome!<BR>

&gt;Hi ANNA,<BR>

Read with great interest your instructions. One question:<BR>
<BR>
What is &quot;double decker&quot;, using 14 jars?  With my Donvier yogurt maker,<BR>
the<BR>
plastic lid fits down over the jars, and doesn't allow any room for<BR>
additional jars.  Do you have a yogurt maker that has a large enough<BR>
&quot;dome&quot;<BR>
to allow this?  Or, have you improvised?<BR>
<BR>

I forgot to mention that you just leave off the dome.  My yogurt maker<BR>
is a<BR>
Canadian Salton brand that is round with 7 little holes for glasses or<BR>
jars.  I<BR>
put the 7 covered jars filled with yogurt mixture in the machine as<BR>
usual. <BR>
Then I put a plate  directly on top of those jars.  Then I place the 7<BR>
covered<BR>
jars filled with sour cream mixture on top of the plate.  Then I wrap<BR>
the whole<BR>
thing with a thick bath towel instead of putting the regular dome on,<BR>
since the<BR>
dome would not fit over both deckers and keep it warm.   The towel does<BR>
the<BR>
trick.  Hope this helps.<BR>

Remove pan from heat and stir in the almond flour.<BR>
Butter pie pan and spread the above mixture into pan just going about<BR>
half<BR>

Cook at 375F for 15 min. Remove from oven.<BR>
<BR>
While crust is cooking make filling:<BR>
 <BR>
1/2 medium size onion, chopped<BR>
3/4 lb mushrooms, washed and sliced<BR>
6 oz grated mild or med. cheddar cheese (about 2 cups)<BR>
1 cup homemade yogurt<BR>
4 well beaten eggs<BR>
2 tbsp butter<BR>
1/4 tsp salt<BR>
1/4 tsp dry oregano (1 tsp if fresh)<BR>
2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
This really isn't very difficult to make. Hope you like it.<BR>

Dear Anna,<BR>

  I believe that Elaine's<BR>
&gt;daughter is not &quot;cured&quot; (don't get upset Rachel) of her UC, she<BR>
&gt;simply has no more symptoms to deal with (which is what we are all<BR>
&gt;aiming for, is it not ?).<BR>
<BR>
Dear Dan (&amp; everone),<BR>
I aplogize if I seem like a hard a-- and inflexible on my veiws on the<BR>
SCD.<BR>
I basically agree with everything you have to say Dan, but I still think<BR>
that the question here is one of symantics. My beleif is that as long as<BR>
I<BR>
am symptom free (over 2 years so far), I'm no longer ill (cured?). Maybe<BR>
its because I was SO sick for SO long that I feel this way. I agree with<BR>
you that if I went back to eating &quot;normal&quot;, I may again become ill, but<BR>
currently I am healthy (cured?). Maybe I'm fooling myself, maybe I want<BR>
to<BR>
not have UC, but as long as I am symptom free, I feel as though I don't<BR>
have UC. In any case we can all call ourselves whatever we want, as long<BR>
as<BR>
we aren't bleeding, running to bathrooms and in constant pain, its<BR>
really<BR>
all that matters. Agreed? Love and health to all.<BR>

&gt; Lucy,<BR>
&gt; Thanks for replying.  Do you use homemade yogurt to make frozen<BR>
yogurt? <BR>
If so,<BR>
&gt; do you use yogurt made from 1/2 and 1/2 or just milk?  Do you add the<BR>
&gt; flavorings such as honey, or fruit after it's all done, or before you<BR>
put<BR>
it in<BR>
&gt; the ice cream maker?  Isn't it kind of a hassle to have to turn it<BR>
every<BR>
few<BR>
&gt; minutes?  Wouldn't an electric one be better?  Just wondering.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
Dear Anna,<BR>
The yogurt should of course be homemade if on the SCD. I usually use<BR>
whole<BR>
milk yogurt, but I suppose 1/2 &amp; 1/2 would be OK, too. One time I made<BR>
it<BR>
with<BR>
yogurt made with half<BR>
1/2 &amp; 1/2 and half whole milk, and it turned out really good.<BR>
Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. I put the honey in first,<BR>
then<BR>
stir in a little of the yogurt until smooth and runny, then stir in the<BR>
rest of the yogurt, vanilla, and salt. If you want to add fruit, you can<BR>
add<BR>
it at this<BR>
stage, or just make plain vanilla and serve the fruit on top. <BR>
If you had to turn it every few minutes for an hour, I'd say it would be<BR>
a<BR>
hassle. Twenty minutes goes by pretty quickly. It's not too big or heavy<BR>
so I just bring it with me into the living room. I also really like<BR>
mixing<BR>
orange juice and yogurt together, honey and a dash of salt. Tastes like<BR>
those orange push-up things we had as kids.<BR>
I've never used an electric ice cream maker, but I think with those you<BR>
have to use<BR>
the ice and salt, and more time.<BR>
Lucy<BR>
PS. I think arriving at the proper sweetness level for your taste buds<BR>
is<BR>
going to affect how much you enjoy the end product. <BR>

If you are asking about commercial frozen yogurt, it is not allowed<BR>

Dear Fellow SCDer's,<BR>
My experience was I was always hungry BEFORE I went on the diet. After<BR>
starting the SCD I felt I had a better feel for when I had had enough. =<BR>
For<BR>
me, the starch had an addictive quality to it. I can eat 2 almond flour<BR>
cookies now and feel satisfied, but back in the old days I'd probably =<BR>
just<BR>
be getting started with 2 really good homemade chocolate chip cookies. =<BR>
Same<BR>
story with something like pizza. I always felt I would have liked to =<BR>
have<BR>
had some more. The way I look at things is, what we are eating is REAL<BR>
food. Most of the stuff we had to give up didn't have much nutritional<BR>
value anyway. A couple of years ago, I remember Elaine saying that =<BR>
people<BR>
now are eating like peasants, filling up on starch. Cheap filler.=20<BR>
Speaking from personal experience, I believe that once you get past the<BR>
starch addiction, your body and mind will thrive on the diet.=20<BR>
Lucy<BR>
PS. My husband who's about 90% on the diet and doesn't have to be, says<BR>
even his taste for &quot;bad&quot; food has changed. =20<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hi Folks,<BR>
<BR>
I just finished a semester in the university I attend and finally had =<BR>
time to review my 400+ e-mail messages.<BR>
<BR>
I've had Chrone's for 6 years, but wasn't diagnosed with it until 3 =<BR>
years ago. Since my diagnosis I've stayed on Asulfidine and Rowasa =<BR>
suppositories. Before SCD, I tried to get off the meds with absolutely =<BR>
no success. I tried Asacol which turned into a disaster (I didn't =<BR>
realize that Asacol had lactose in it until I reviewed the recent =<BR>
postings). Until about 6 months ago the meds kept everything under =<BR>
control. But since that 6 month period, and before SCD, my gas, =<BR>
cramping, and diarrhea kept getting worse. So about two months ago I =<BR>
surfed the Internet for an alternative method of treating my Chrone's =<BR>
and up popped the SCD page on the Altavista Search Engine. I immediately<BR>
=<BR>
got Elaine's book, got rid of the nonallowables in my house and started<BR>
=<BR>
the diet. I'm lucky, because my university is only a 15 minute drive =<BR>
from the Hughson Nut Company.<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the SCD for a little over a month and everything is going =<BR>
well. I can tolerate citrus and grapes in small amounts; I have to water<BR>
=<BR>
down all of the juices except pineapple juice; and I have to stay =<BR>
totally away from the bean complex. Everything else is well tolerated. =<BR>
I'm also off of Rowasa and I'm only taking one Azulfadine tablet 4 times<BR>
=<BR>
a day.<BR>
<BR>
As for appetite, mine has diminished significantly. I was overweight =<BR>
before I started this diet because I just couldn't keep my face out of =<BR>
the refrigerator. I always seemed to want food. Prior to going on the =<BR>
SCD, I normally satisfied the craving by stuffing my face with more =<BR>
non-nutritional food; consequently, the cravings never went away. This =<BR>
wasn't a problem when I constantly trained for triathlons. But once I =<BR>
retired from the Air Force and started attending college about two and a<BR>
=<BR>
half years ago, my exercising decreased while my craving attacks =<BR>
continued. As a result, I gained 35 lbs.<BR>
<BR>
After about two weeks on the SCD, I noticed that I no longer had =<BR>
constant craving for more food and that I wasn't overeating. At first, I<BR>
=<BR>
chalked it up to determined will power on my part; that was until I saw<BR>
=<BR>
Lucy's posting on her diminished craving. Now I'm beginning to believe =<BR>
that non-nutritional foods some how increases the craving because the =<BR>
body isn't getting all of the right vitamins and minerals that it needs.<BR>
=<BR>
I guess the SCD supplies the body with what it needs, thus restoring =<BR>
nutritional balance. Since this balance is restored, the body seems to =<BR>
think it's happy and therefore the brain no longer sends out food =<BR>
craving signals.<BR>
<BR>
I would imagine that underweight people would continue to crave food on<BR>
=<BR>
the SCD until the their bodies obtained the proper weight.<BR>
<BR>
This posting is only my opinion. I have no medical background so I could<BR>
=<BR>
be completely off base. But, I can say that I have lost 12 of my 35 =<BR>
unwanted pounds, I feel great (I have more energy), the diarrhea is =<BR>
gone, and the food cravings that had plagued me for years has vanished.<BR>
=<BR>
The only thing I changed in the last month is my diet. SCD works for me<BR>
=<BR>
and it has stopped my craving. I'm definitely a believer in this diet.<BR>
<BR>

Howdie,<BR>
<BR>
In the past, my yoghurt had a tendency to separate and be a little<BR>
&quot;clumpy.&quot;  I remember someone recently complaining of this and no one<BR>
seemed to solve the problem, just say that the clear liquid was whey.  <BR>
<BR>
There seem to be a number of beginners here, so I think this might bear<BR>
repeating -- it was mentioned some months ago:<BR>
<BR>
Cleanliness is the key to good yoghurt!<BR>
<BR>
Sure enough, for the last couple of batches I placed all the utensils<BR>
and<BR>
containers in boiling water for a few minutes and these batches came out<BR>
superbly -- very little separation, few clumps, nice, creamy<BR>
consistancy.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

<BR>
Hi Guys!  I don't if everyone will find this interesting, but I'm taking<BR>
a<BR>
rather analytic approach to adapting recipes to this diet.  I found a<BR>
couple<BR>
of interesting references in The Joy of Cooking that I thought would be<BR>
helpful and figured I'd share them.  (Those who know and love The Joy of<BR>
Cooking will recognize the tone.)<BR>
<BR>
Honey:  &quot;As honey has greater sweetening power than sugar, we prefer to<BR>
substitute 1 cup of honey for 1 1/4 cups of sugar and to reduce the<BR>
liquid in<BR>
the recipe by 1/4 cup.  To neutralize the acidity of honey--unless sour<BR>
milk<BR>
or sour cream is called for in the recipe--add a mere pinch of baking<BR>
soda.<BR>
 If honey is substituted in jams, jellies, or candies a higher degree of<BR>
heat<BR>
must be used in cooking.  In candies, more persistent beating is needed<BR>
and<BR>
careful storage required against absorption of atmospheric moisture.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Summary ala Ellen:  When substituting honey, use a volume equal to  80%<BR>
of<BR>
the amount of sugar called for in the recipe and reduce the liquid by<BR>
1/4 c<BR>
for each cup of honey used.  For example, if 2/3 c of sugar is called<BR>
for,<BR>
use 1/2 c. of honey and reduce the liquid by 1/8 cup.  <BR>
<BR>
Baking Soda:  Since we use baking soda as our only leavening agent I<BR>
thought<BR>
some insight on it's properties would be helpful in selecting the most<BR>
appropriate recipes to adapt.  Joy of Cooking says &quot;Used alone, baking<BR>
soda<BR>
has no leavening properties.  But used in combination with some acid<BR>
ingredients such as sour milk or molasses, it gives one of the very<BR>
tenderest<BR>
crumbs.  The proportion of baking soda to sour milk or buttermilk is<BR>
usually<BR>
1 tsp soda to 1 cup sour milk.  The acidity of chocolate, honey, or corn<BR>
syrup is not strong enough to be the only source of acid, so some<BR>
recipes<BR>
with these acid ingredients may call for both baking powder and baking<BR>
soda.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
What this means to us:  Our yogurt is an excellent source of acid to<BR>
react<BR>
with the baking soda.  A recipe where honey is the only source of acid<BR>
will<BR>
have trouble rising.  Seek recipes where yogurt can be substituted for<BR>
liquid<BR>
in order to provide an optimum source of acid for the baking soda, and<BR>
the<BR>
leavening effect will be maximized.<BR>
<BR>
Have others come up with &quot;rules of thumb&quot; for adapting recipes?  I'd be<BR>
interested in hearing about it (like how to figure the substitution of<BR>
almond<BR>
flour for regular flour).<BR>

Dear Bill,<BR>
In making yogurt, another thing I found that helps in making a creamy<BR>
smooth consistancy is the following; when I add the starter (I use<BR>
commercial yogurt) I use a whisk attachment on my hand mixer. I add the<BR>
starter to about 3 cups of boiled (cooled to room temperature or less,<BR>
this<BR>
is key, it can't even be vaguely warm) 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (I make 3 quarts at a<BR>
time) and whisk, then I add that back to the rest of the cooled 1/2 &amp;<BR>
1/2<BR>
and whisk this before putting it in the oven with the light bulb for 36<BR>
hours.<BR>

Why do you incubate for 36 hours instead of 24?  Is it because of the<BR>

almond<BR>
&gt; flour for regular flour).<BR>

Dear Ellen,<BR>
If you put all the wet ingredients in the bowl first, then all you have<BR>
to<BR>
do is stir in enough flour to get the batter to the consistency you<BR>
want.<BR>
I'm usually aiming for not too runny or too stiff. <BR>
I just guess at the sweetness level, and if necessary, adjust it next<BR>
time<BR>
around.<BR>
I haven't needed to add yogurt to get the baking soda to make things<BR>
rise. <BR>
Since you said the other day that your carrot cake turned out wet in the<BR>
middle and was cooking too fast on top, don't forget to try a lower oven<BR>
temperature next time. I like around 315F.<BR>
I think the baked goods turn out as good as if they were made with real<BR>
flour. The advantage of the almond flour is that it has a mild flavor,<BR>
so<BR>
it makes a good substitute for regular flour. I don't have any<BR>
objections<BR>
to the pecan flour other than the fact that it isn't as versatile<BR>
because<BR>
of it's stronger flavor. <BR>
Hope to hear that the SCD is working for you.<BR>

I just finished canning fresh tomato puree so I can use it in the winter<BR>
to<BR>
make spaghetti sauce, catsup, etc.  I think this will taste a lot better<BR>
than<BR>
trying to cook with the tomatoes available in the market in the winter.<BR>
<BR>
Do others can their own food for this diet?  Is there anything else I'm<BR>

I also let the yogurt &quot;cook&quot; for at least 30 hours and use a whisk.  It<BR>
always comes out to a nice consistency and tastes great--and prior to<BR>
the<BR>
diet I hated yogurt!!!  The additional fermentation time also assures<BR>
that<BR>
all the lactose has been consumed.<BR>
<BR>
When I make yogurt for making frozen yogurt, I ferment it for 48 hours.<BR>

I think it is.  I'm adapting pretty well to the diet.  <BR>
<BR>
I've noticed that my insides seem much less swollen, and I've lost a few<BR>
pounds (a good thing in my case).  There have been a couple of times<BR>
that I<BR>
didn't feel well, body was &quot;off&quot;, felt tired and lacking nutrition, but<BR>
I<BR>
think I either wasn't eating enough or wasn't getting enough fat to have<BR>
energy (carrot cake solved it once, salmon solved it another time).  <BR>
<BR>
I suspect that my energy is better but that's hard to tell because I had<BR>
my<BR>
period this week and, ever since I got the crohns, it's a pretty painful<BR>
and<BR>
miserable experience.<BR>
<BR>
I've been surprised that I haven't had more cravings.  I thought I'd be<BR>
dying<BR>
for a coke by now, wishing for a piece of bread, and salivating for a<BR>
waffle,<BR>
but I really am not craving those things.  <BR>
<BR>
D has never been a major symptom of mine so I started on a modified<BR>
start up<BR>
diet.  I'm only eating foods I'm pretty sure about, just eating them in<BR>
different proportions than I once did.  For breakfast I put yogurt,<BR>
berries,<BR>
and banana in the blender (instead of my former oatmeal granola bar!),<BR>
lunch<BR>
has been scrambled eggs or nothing (I tend to have breakfast late and<BR>
forget<BR>
lunch), dinner has been chicken/fish/meatloaf, with cooked veggies and<BR>
homemade applesauce.  All foods I eat are strictly legal on the diet (no<BR>
cheating).<BR>
<BR>
The one area I've strayed intentionally is that the diet allows only<BR>
&quot;weak&quot;<BR>
coffee.  I still make my normal coffee in the morning and drink 2 or 3<BR>
cups<BR>
of it.  This ritual has always been important for motivating my bowels<BR>
in the<BR>
morning and therefore having my body be comfortable during the day. <BR>
Cutting<BR>
that out along with everything else seemed like too drastic a change for<BR>
my<BR>
system, and unnecessary since I don't have diareaha.  I don't drink<BR>
coffee<BR>
any other time of the day though.<BR>
<BR>
My bowel movements have been changing in various ways though and I don't<BR>
really understand the correlations yet.  For the last few days they were<BR>
dark<BR>
(black and greenish), sticky, and low volume.  I'd have to go a few<BR>
times a<BR>
day but my body didn't produce much.  Is this an adjustment phase to the<BR>
diet<BR>
or the result of not eating enough food? enough fat?  enough water?  I'm<BR>
having to learn a new way of looking at the question &quot;what does my body<BR>
want&quot;<BR>
since some of my former answers aren't on the list anymore, and that<BR>
seems to<BR>
have even changed the questions!<BR>
<BR>
Today I'm spending the day at a Renaissance Fair with friends.  I'm<BR>
packing<BR>
my own food because I don't know what they will have.  I packed up some<BR>
pop-top tuna fish, a little can of fruit in its own juice, a small can<BR>
of<BR>
dole pinapple juice, some bananas, and some carbonated water.  Anyone<BR>
have<BR>
other creative ideas for no-refrigeration lunch food?<BR>
<BR>
People's reactions have been interesting.  My housemate has been<BR>
completely<BR>
supportive (he spent his Saturday buying and carrying groceries for me).<BR>
 I<BR>
offered to buy some baking potatoes to make with his supper but he<BR>
vetoed<BR>
that idea--he wants me to use my energy to make things that are right<BR>
for me<BR>
and he intends to just eat what I eat.  So far, he's had high praise for<BR>
the<BR>
meals I've fixed.  Some of my other friends surprise me--they say<BR>
there's no<BR>
way I'll be able to stay on a diet this restrictive.  One invited me out<BR>
for<BR>
waffles figuring I'd have given up on the diet in less than a week. <BR>
These<BR>
are generally very supportive people (one friend even has MS and her<BR>
husband<BR>
has crohns) but they see this as something silly, frivolous, and<BR>
transient.<BR>
 For the last 2.5 years, I've essentially eaten a low fiber diet but<BR>
whatever<BR>
I cared to within that, so it's not as though I've ever tried and given<BR>
up on<BR>
a diet.  I don't understand their attitude.  Have others experienced<BR>
this?<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for the length.  I guess I'm verbose by nature!<BR>
<BR>
Overall, I'm very happy with the diet.  My body seems to prefer this way<BR>
of<BR>
eating and, like most of you, all I care about finding a way for it to<BR>
be<BR>
happy!  My outlook is that I'm assuming I'll just continue eating this<BR>
way<BR>
for the long term, maybe forever.  Since I got crohns I've eaten a lot<BR>
of<BR>
starch because that seemed like a satisfying, low fiber approach to<BR>
feeding<BR>
myself (pasta, oatmeal, potatoes).  I can see now that it was bogging<BR>
down my<BR>
energy.  In 2.5 years, I've been continously sick with only brief<BR>
glimpses of<BR>
the freedom of remission.  My doctor has said that I'm permanently<BR>
partially<BR>
disabled and that my condition will not improve.  I'm planning to see<BR>
him in<BR>
a month and get some new benchmarks on things like my sed rate (it runs<BR>
about<BR>
40 and normal goes up to 30).  That should really tell us both<BR>
something.<BR>

<BR>
Somebody just starting out on the diet recently asked if shortening is<BR>
allowed. It isn't.<BR>
In my opinion, a great features of our diet is that you are off all<BR>
partially hydrogenated oils (trans-fatty acids). Prior to starting the<BR>
diet, even if you hadn't been using shortening  or margarine at home,<BR>
you<BR>
would have been consuming a fair share of these fats in ready made<BR>
foods. I<BR>
believe that getting this kind of fat out of our diets for a period of<BR>
time<BR>
explains why so many of us have improved cholesterol levels, in spite of<BR>
eating a lot of the foods the cholesterol police warn against. I<BR>
recently<BR>
had mine checked after having been on the diet for a few years. My HDL<BR>
was<BR>
70, and my overall level was under 200. The desirable range for HDL<BR>
(good<BR>
cholesterol) is 35-60, and anything over is supposed to be all the<BR>
better.<BR>
By the nurses reaction to my results, I got the feeling that they don't<BR>
see<BR>
too many people going above the desired range. I took the opportunity<BR>
(sneaky me) to tell her about the diet. She was actually very interested<BR>
because her sister has UC.<BR>
I recently read that Dr. Walter Willet, chairman orf the department of<BR>
Harvard University's School of Public Health, estimates that consumption<BR>
of<BR>
trans-fatty acids in the United States accounts for thirty thousand<BR>
premature deaths per year.<BR>
So, it looks like we may very well end up with more than just healthy<BR>
intestines on our SCD.<BR>

Hello,<BR>

My name is Stephanie.  This is my first try at the doing the SCD-list. <BR>
=<BR>
I've been on the SCD since July 9 and it seems to be working pretty =<BR>
well.  (I have &quot;irritable bowel syndrome&quot;.)  I'm having a big problem, =<BR>
though.  I have low energy and have lost most of my muscle strength.  I<BR>
=<BR>
used to swim a mile per day, bike ride, and work out (weights) at the =<BR>
gym regularly.  Now I'm having trouble walking up a flight of stairs.  =<BR>
My calorie intake is a little lower, but not that much.  I've lost 10 =<BR>
lbs (this is not a good thing).<BR>
<BR>
My digestive system feels so much better, I'm afraid to go off the diet.<BR>
=<BR>
 I can't continue like this though either.  Is the weakness something =<BR>
temporary?<BR>

Please let me know what you've experienced.<BR>

&gt; Dear Bill,<BR>
&gt; In making yogurt, another thing I found that helps in making a creamy<BR>
&gt; smooth consistancy is the following; when I add the starter (I use<BR>
&gt; commercial yogurt) I use a whisk attachment on my hand mixer. I add<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; starter to about 3 cups of boiled (cooled to room temperature or less,<BR>
this<BR>
&gt; is key, it can't even be vaguely warm) 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (I make 3 quarts at a<BR>
&gt; time) and whisk, then I add that back to the rest of the cooled 1/2 &amp;<BR>
1/2<BR>
&gt; and whisk this before putting it in the oven with the light bulb for<BR>
36<BR>
&gt; hours.<BR>

I add the starter at about that same temperature.  That's what's<BR>
indicated on<BR>
my yogurt thermometer.  It takes a little over an hour to reach that<BR>
temp<BR>
after boiling if I leave it out on the counter, and a bit over 20<BR>
minutes if<BR>

It sounds like a lot of people are incubating for longer than 24 hours<BR>
and<BR>
that this results in a yogurt that is less tart than the 24 hour<BR>
version.  <BR>
<BR>
I've read that as yogurt incubates for longer than 6 hours, the<BR>
acidopholis<BR>
gets crowded and runs out of food, resulting in a tart taste.  (This<BR>
makes<BR>
sense to me given the tartness of my SCD yogurt).  I would think that<BR>
beyond<BR>
some point, the acidopholis would start dying off due to the crowding<BR>
and<BR>
lack of food.  I wonder whether yogurt incubated 36 hours would be less<BR>
tart<BR>
because it would have less live acidopholis in it.  (Have others looked<BR>
into<BR>
this question?)  If so, is it still as good for us on the SCD?<BR>
<BR>
Also, I notice that everyone seems to use the same process for making<BR>
the<BR>
yogurt from half and half as from milk--same amount of time and starter.<BR>
 In<BR>
Elaine's book she recommends more starter.  I wonder whether cream has<BR>
more<BR>
lactose in it to start with and therefore would require either more<BR>
starter<BR>
or more time to make it lactose free.  Is there a way to test whether<BR>
the<BR>
product is actually free of lactose?  <BR>
<BR>
Rachel?  Do you know the answers to these?  Perhaps they've been<BR>
discussed<BR>
before.  If not, these two questions might be good to review with Elaine<BR>
given the significance of yogurt in the diet and the importance of it<BR>
providing a suitable level of acidopholis while being lactose free.<BR>

I was just wondering about the cheeses the book says you can eat<BR>
occasionally. How often is that? If they don't seem to cause any<BR>
reaction,<BR>
can you eat them more frequently, or will the symptoms crawl slowly up<BR>
on<BR>
you?<BR>
<BR>
I am asking because I recently seem to have become addicted to grated<BR>
Parmesan cheese in my daily salad, sprinkling maybe three tablespoons of<BR>
it<BR>
on top of the lettuce.<BR>
<BR>
I am on my 11th month of the diet and have found it to be nothing less<BR>
than<BR>
miraculous.<BR>

In the instructions for making yogurt that came with my Yogourmet yogurt<BR>
maker, it says the ideal temperature of the milk when adding the starter<BR>
should be between 111 and 113 F.  Mine comes out perfectly every time.<BR>

&gt;So wait a minute - when you say room temperature, do you mean 70 F or<BR>
so?<BR>
&gt;I figured that my yogurt maker would take at least 4-6 hours to bring<BR>
the<BR>
&gt;mixuture back up to temp, so I add the starter at 100-110 F.<BR>

&gt;&gt; Dear Bill,<BR>
&gt;&gt; In making yogurt, another thing I found that helps in making a creamy<BR>
&gt;&gt; smooth consistancy is the following; when I add the starter (I use<BR>
&gt;&gt; commercial yogurt) I use a whisk attachment on my hand mixer. I add<BR>
the<BR>
&gt;&gt; starter to about 3 cups of boiled (cooled to room temperature or<BR>
less,<BR>
&gt;this<BR>
&gt;&gt; is key, it can't even be vaguely warm) 1/2 &amp; 1/2 (I make 3 quarts at<BR>
a<BR>
&gt;&gt; time) and whisk, then I add that back to the rest of the cooled 1/2 &amp;<BR>
1/2<BR>
&gt;&gt; and whisk this before putting it in the oven with the light bulb for<BR>
36<BR>
&gt;&gt; hours.<BR>

Dear Bill,<BR>
If you've been successful with adding starter at 100 degrees, keep doing<BR>
so. I've found that if the milk temperature is even a little warm (I<BR>
stick<BR>
my finger in it to test), I get a seperated gook that tastes awful. I<BR>
think<BR>
that any warmth kills off the bacteria in the starter.<BR>

&gt;Hello, Stephanie.<BR>
<BR>
I have been on the SCD since June 15 and have basically experienced the<BR>
same as you have, almost identical.  I have either IBS OR UC, depending<BR>
on<BR>
whose diagnosis I consider.  Recently, I have noticed that instead of<BR>
constant weakness, sometimes legs like rubber!, it is<BR>
fluctuating...energy<BR>
will rise and I'll feel really good for a day or two; then the weakness<BR>
sets in...my morale does the same! when this happens.  I am presently<BR>
taking two different &quot;supports&quot;...herbs...one that  is a colon cleanser<BR>
and<BR>
has lots of acidolpholus and bifidus, etc. and the other is Panex for<BR>
amoebas, which I have had (for 4 years) while living in India and which<BR>
I<BR>
believe to be the source of my intestinal problem, although the<BR>
gastroenterologist does not!  The reason I am telling you about the<BR>
colon<BR>
cleansers is that my stool had firmed up quite a bit (soft instead of<BR>
runny) before I started the colon cleansers and now it is back to runny;<BR>
so<BR>
it is hard to tell if these are irritating the colon or if it is some of<BR>
the things I am eating on the diet...I'm still not eating &quot;raw&quot;, nuts,<BR>
(but<BR>
am eating nut flour).  I am on the colon cleansers for total of 6<BR>
weeks...4<BR>
more to go...then we'll see...I am noticing decrease in pain and Elaine<BR>
says this is usually the first symptom to go...let's hope.  The support<BR>
of<BR>
this group is nothing short of amazing; people are so generous with<BR>
their<BR>
time, energy and experience and not to mention the wonderful recipes! <BR>
Try<BR>
Lucy's Spinach/Mushroom Quiche she put on the internet last Friday! <BR>
It's<BR>
just delicious...Got anymore recipes just as good, Lucy?  My weight loss<BR>
has stabilized and I've even gained 2 1/2 lbs. of the 10 I lost at the<BR>
beginning of the diet.  At the beginning of the diet, I was going to the<BR>
gym 3x/wk. and haven't been at all since starting it, just too weak, but<BR>
in<BR>
last few days, when I feel stronger, it comes up for me to go back and<BR>
gently and slowly restart my program..so hang in there...I am.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, Stephanie.<BR>

Hi Stephanie,<BR>
<BR>
I found that when I first went on the SCD, that my energy levels =<BR>
dissipated at first. This only lasted for a couple of weeks. I also lost<BR>
=<BR>
weight, and I still am; but I was also 35 lbs over the weight that I =<BR>
maintained while I was training for triathlons. Just before I went on =<BR>
the diet, I swam a mile every other day, ran 4 miles every alternate =<BR>
day, and biked about 30 to 40 miles on either Saturday or Sunday.<BR>
<BR>
Right after I went on the SCD I found that I could swim no more than 500<BR>
=<BR>
yards, run 2 miles if I was lucky, and I stopped the bike rides. But =<BR>
after about 2 weeks on the diet, my energy reserves began to pickup =<BR>
again. I've been on the diet about a month and a half, and I continue to<BR>
=<BR>
get stronger. Stick with the diet for at least a month and see what =<BR>
happens. Also, put more high calorie allowables in your diet and try to<BR>
=<BR>
eat more frequently. This may help stem your weight loss.<BR>
<BR>
Since I'm not down to ideal weight yet, I'm not quite sure if the weight<BR>
=<BR>
loss will stop when I get there. If I continue to lose weight after I =<BR>
get to my ideal weight then I'll eat more often and increase my calorie<BR>
=<BR>
intake.<BR>
<BR>
I know your frustration. Aerobic fanatics can't stand not training. But<BR>
=<BR>
when we have gut problems we must decide what is more important to us. I<BR>
=<BR>
have Chrones and the disease was getting worse for me in spite of the =<BR>
medications. The SCD was the only thing that worked for me. It's tough =<BR>
as an aerobic alcoholic not to suck down all the complex carbohydrates =<BR>
that we have to have to sustain our aerobic energy; I sympathize with =<BR>
you. Since I can't consume complex carbohydrates on this diet, I doubt =<BR>
that I will ever be able to run my usual 40 miles per week, bike 100 =<BR>
miles per week, or swim 5 mile per week (this was my regular routine =<BR>
until about 2 1/2 years ago when I had to give it up to attend school =<BR>
full time). But after I graduate next year I will see how much I can do.<BR>
<BR>
But as for my current exercise routine, I'm almost back to where I was =<BR>
just before I started the SCD. Hang in their.<BR>
<BR>
One other quick note. I used to take a lot of motrin and ibuprofen for =<BR>
running and biking injuries before I was diagnosed with Chrones 3 years<BR>
=<BR>
ago. My doctor said these medications irritate the digestive lining and<BR>
=<BR>
may have had a significant role in me getting the disease in the first =<BR>
place. If you are taking these anti-inflammatory drugs, you might want =<BR>
to seriously consider giving them up.<BR>
<BR>
At any rate, stick with the diet, increase your calorie intake, and you<BR>
=<BR>
will probably find that your energy will begin to return before too =<BR>
long. I found that it just took a little while for my body to adjust to<BR>
=<BR>
the diet. Don't give it up yet.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,<BR>
Glenn<BR>

Hello,<BR>
<BR>
My name is Stephanie.  This is my first try at the doing the SCD-list. <BR>
=<BR>
I've been on the SCD since July 9 and it seems to be working pretty =<BR>
well.  (I have &quot;irritable bowel syndrome&quot;.)  I'm having a big problem, =<BR>
though.  I have low energy and have lost most of my muscle strength.  I<BR>
=<BR>
used to swim a mile per day, bike ride, and work out (weights) at the =<BR>
gym regularly.  Now I'm having trouble walking up a flight of stairs.  =<BR>
My calorie intake is a little lower, but not that much.  I've lost 10 =<BR>
lbs (this is not a good thing).<BR>
<BR>
My digestive system feels so much better, I'm afraid to go off the diet.<BR>
=<BR>
 I can't continue like this though either.  Is the weakness something =<BR>
temporary?<BR>
<BR>
Please let me know what you've experienced.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks.<BR>

&gt;Dear Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
Do you think it would work to &quot;double decker&quot; the yogurt making?  That<BR>
is,<BR>
to buy extra jars and just set them on top of the ones in the yogurt<BR>
maker;<BR>
place a towel over all to hold in the heat and let it hum away for 24-36<BR>
hours?<BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, I just finished makaing yogurt for 36 hours instead of 24,<BR>
and it was a little less tart!<BR>
<BR>
A question for you that has been running through my mind lately...if you<BR>
are symptom-free 2 years, why are you still on the diet?  And do you<BR>
ever<BR>
&quot;fudge&quot;...meaning, eat something other than the diet?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your stalwart support!<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha.<BR>
<BR>
P.S.  I was wondering how you tested to see if the yogurt was &quot;even a<BR>
little bit warm&quot; and was delighted to read that you stick your finger in<BR>
it! That's what I do, but wondered if I was putting &quot;bacteria&quot; into it<BR>
that<BR>
didn't need to be there...I'm becoming such a &quot;fanatic&quot; about bacteria<BR>
these days!<BR>

&gt; The one area I've strayed intentionally is that the diet allows only<BR>
&quot;weak&quot;<BR>
&gt; coffee.  I still make my normal coffee in the morning and drink 2 or 3<BR>
cups<BR>
&gt; of it.  This ritual has always been important for motivating my bowels<BR>
in<BR>
the<BR>
&gt; morning and therefore having my body be comfortable during the day. <BR>
Cutting<BR>
&gt; that out along with everything else seemed like too drastic a change<BR>
for<BR>
my<BR>

coffee<BR>
&gt; any other time of the day though.<BR>

Dear Ellen,<BR>
<BR>
I doubt that Elaine requires that the coffee be very weak just to give<BR>
us<BR>
coffee lovers a bad time. My concern with drinking regular strength<BR>
coffee<BR>
is that besides propelling the contents of the colon forward, it most<BR>
likely moves the contents of<BR>
your small intestine forward also. If the enzymes in the small intestine<BR>
haven't finished doing their job, then undigested food could be feeding<BR>
the<BR>
bacteria and yeast in the colon.<BR>
There are probably other reasons for restricting strong coffee intake.<BR>
I'm<BR>
guessing it might irritate the lining of the intestine.<BR>
Hopefully, getting off of a high starch diet will correct your morning<BR>
slugishness, and you won't be &quot;needing&quot; the coffee.<BR>
With the addictive quality of caffeine I know it's hard it is to kick<BR>
the<BR>
habit, but it is necessary, to truly be on the diet. I find I'm better<BR>
off<BR>
just staying away from it, because it seems like as with most addictive<BR>
substances, a little eventually leads to more (weak to stronger). At<BR>
least<BR>
that was my experience.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.<BR>
Lucy<BR>
<BR>
PS. Of course if you can manage to stick to truly very weak coffee,<BR>
there<BR>
should be no problem. The way I deal with it is to have it on rare<BR>
occasions, rather than make it a daily routine. That way the strength<BR>
has<BR>
less of a chance of sneaking up on me.<BR>

Hi Lucy,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Somebody just starting out on the diet recently asked if shortening is<BR>
&gt; allowed. It isn't.<BR>
&gt; In my opinion, a great features of our diet is that you are off all<BR>
&gt; partially hydrogenated oils (trans-fatty acids). Prior to starting the<BR>
&gt; diet, even if you hadn't been using shortening  or margarine at home,<BR>
you<BR>
&gt; would have been consuming a fair share of these fats in ready made<BR>
foods.<BR>
&gt; ...&lt;snip&gt;...<BR>
&gt; I recently read that Dr. Walter Willet, chairman orf the department of<BR>
&gt; Harvard University's School of Public Health, estimates that<BR>
consumption of<BR>
&gt; trans-fatty acids in the United States accounts for thirty thousand<BR>
&gt; premature deaths per year.<BR>
<BR>
I agree with you.  I just read an article stating the same thing about<BR>
the 1994<BR>
Harvard study.  The article was &quot;Margarine and the Great Consumer Con<BR>
Job&quot;<BR>
by John Finnegan, MD.  It was in &lt;&lt;Health Naturally&gt;&gt; June/July 1997<BR>
issue,<BR>
which is a Canadian magazine.  They can be reached at (705) 746-7839 and<BR>
<BR>
subscription rate is $19/yr (6 issuesi, add $9 in USA).  I have had this<BR>
magazine for years and they are very good for alternative medicine.<BR>
<BR>
The article shows that butter (allowed on SCD) is a much better food<BR>
item,<BR>
since margarine is a non-food.  They do recommend that raw organice<BR>
butter<BR>
or certified organic coconut butter is better, since commercial butter<BR>
can<BR>
contain pesticides and antibiotics.  However, I don't know if raw butter<BR>
(non-pasteurized) has all lactose trace removed for the SCD diet.<BR>
<BR>
Another interesting thing I read in that issue regarding Aspartame,<BR>
better<BR>
known as Equal and NutraSweet, is that it was developed by Monsanto,<BR>
the world's biggest producer of pesticides and poisons.  The FDA knows<BR>
of<BR>
over 10,000 adverse affect but refuses to make it public because of the<BR>
(disgusting) industry lobbyists.  Does anyone remember RC Cola, which<BR>
was made with Aspartame ?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>
