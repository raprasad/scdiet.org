<BR>
Mary,<BR>
<BR>
I sit here stunned from reading your email.  My prayers and hope go out<BR>
to you.  Why do we, and the medical community appear so dumb!!<BR>
Cholesterol is an extremely essential chemical to many of our body<BR>
functions.  It would be like saying to you, congratulations for getting<BR>
your white blood cells way down below the norms.  They actually call<BR>
that leukemia!<BR>
<BR>
I quote from Udo Erasmus' book,  lower cholesterol &quot;statistically<BR>
increases death rate from suicide and cancer...  Increased cancer may be<BR>
due to lack of oil-soluble anti-cancer anti-oxidants: vitamins E and A,<BR>
and carotene.  These are transported to our cells by the same LDL (a<BR>
form of cholesterol) that bring fats and cholesterol, and may become<BR>
deficient when LDL levels in blood decrease.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Increase suicide may result from increased aggression, supported by the<BR>
finding that low cholesterol levels reduce the number of receptors for<BR>
serotonin on brain cell membranes.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As it relates to me, I know for a fact, when my cholesterol is low, I am<BR>
quite depressed. As I have raised it, I feel quite good!<BR>
<BR>
I hope that treatment for you cancer is coming along well!  I know a<BR>
woman here in phoenix who recovered from major breast cancer using shark<BR>
cartilage extract and Hydrogen Peroxide IV treatments.  If interested, I<BR>
can get you the name of the MD doctor who treated her.  She was a<BR>
remarkable recovery!<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps, working on getting your cholesterol back up coulc help too??<BR>

&gt; Dear Pat and Julie,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Regarding cholesterol, mine was so low awhile back that it was below<BR>
&gt; 100. I<BR>
&gt; was congratulated by the nurse and doctor. Very shortly thereafter, I<BR>
&gt; was<BR>
&gt; diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Someone on another list said that the idea of  cholesterol figures<BR>
&gt; were made<BR>
&gt; up by the pharmaceutical industry to sell drugs.<BR>

What is the experience of you guys with dry wine? I know &quot;the book&quot;<BR>
allows for it.<BR>
<BR>
Does it agree with you?<BR>
<BR>
if so, who much, how often?<BR>

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;Hello everyone !<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have a very question someone may be able to shed some information on.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;It has been exactly 1 month since I started the SCD diet.  So far most of<BR>
my<BR>
&gt;bloating and cramping has gone away almost from the begining.<BR>
snip<BR>
&gt;However, the chronic &quot;D&quot; (diarrhea) has not improved.  And I still get<BR>
those<BR>
snip<BR>
 my diet consists of chicken (usually breast), and turkey<BR>
&gt;(ground breast usually), fish, eggs, cheddar cheese, zucchini, bananas,<BR>
snip<BR>
&gt;the purpose of getting rid of the diarrhea.  I am at a loss.<BR>
&gt;Any help is much appreciated.<BR>
&gt;Simone<BR>
<BR>
Hello Simone:<BR>
<BR>
Page 45 (The Book)&quot;When brisk diarrhea is no longer present, eggs may be<BR>
added to the diet.&quot;<BR>
Hope this helps<BR>

no need to disagree with me, Pat. i just caught myself. you ARE right. after i<BR>
saw your post to Moira, i immediately realized it and was going to write in,<BR>
then i saw YOUR post to me so want to make clear Pat is right. (feels good,<BR>
dont it?) its funny (actually sad) that so many things that have been<BR>
brainwashed into the mind, sticks. i have had the same experience with the<BR>
candida diet. it does not work. so, moira, go ahead and follow the diet as<BR>
outlined. it IS the simple sugars that dont need to be broke down that we<BR>
should be able to digest. theoretically Larry should have no problem.<BR>

Just a brief update on Martine's progress - tomorrow she drops down to 2.5<BR>
prednisone from 3 tablets (15 mgs) where she will stay for about a month.<BR>
She's very happy to be weaning off of this drug.  It is so wonderful to see<BR>
her looking and feeling so good and healthy!  Martine is maintaining her<BR>
weight and very much getting on with her life.  Hope you enjoy the recipe.<BR>

high levels of cholesterol are caused primarily by the consumption of sugar,<BR>
alcohol and caffeine.<BR>
<BR>
eggs, butter, etc. do not raise cholesterol levels IF YOU KEEP sugar, alcohol<BR>
and caffeine OUT of your diet. control of cholesterol is impossible when sugar<BR>
is in the diet. <BR>

one-fourth of all enzyme systems are dependent on fats. <BR>

Dietmar took the words right out of my mouth. what is going on here is &quot;they&quot;<BR>
want us sick. so they make this low-fat crap because we are ignorant enough to<BR>
buy it. everyone is on a low-fat fad craze. its not fat that makes us sick and<BR>
puts us in the hospital. IT IS REFINED SUGAR. so, what they do is remove the<BR>
fat and add the sugar KNOWING we shouldnt be eating it and what it will end up<BR>
doing long term. and look now at how many people are sick.<BR>

Pat and Joan, <BR>
I basically had to go off of the candida diet because of low blood sugar.  I<BR>
had absolutely no energy, plus other problems with grains.  I had a similiar<BR>
experience about 8 years ago when I tried a diet described by a New York dr.<BR>
called  &quot;Medical Makeover&quot;.  So instead of using my head and eating fruits, I<BR>
got discourged and went back to eating junk.  Then I got hooked on the<BR>
low-fat thing, but still ate sugar because it doesn't contain any fat. Then I<BR>
really got sick.  I have been on scd for almost a month and a couple of times<BR>
I have started to feel that really &quot;low feeling&quot; so I made sure I ate fruit<BR>
with almost every meal and I picked-up.  If I could'nt have the fruit, I<BR>
would have abandoned this diet.  I'm doing so well, &quot;knock on wood&quot; and &quot;the<BR>
proof is in the pudding&quot;.  Take care, Jane<BR>
P.S. Pat, thanks for responding to diets I can recommend to friends.  I'm<BR>
going to read Atkins.  <BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;Hi all.<BR>
&gt;I know that there's been a lot of messages concerning youghurt<BR>
&gt;making the last weeks, but I would like to post this one anyway.<BR>
&gt;A few months ago, there was a discussion whether you could use<BR>
&gt;only commercial youghurt and &quot;bake&quot; it for 24 hours or not.<BR>
&gt;I don't know if anyone tried that (at least I haven't seen any<BR>
&gt;postings on it), but now I can tell you that, for the last few<BR>
&gt;weeks, Iv'e eaten about three gallons of this kind of homemade<BR>
&gt;commercial yoghurt with no negative reaction at all.<BR>
&gt;I remember that a couple of weeks ago, in a discussion about if<BR>
&gt;you could use to much commercial yoghurt as starter, someone said<BR>
&gt;that commercial yoghurt could contain up to 30 percent lactose.<BR>
&gt;I don't know about the U.S. commercial yoghurt, but here in Sweden,<BR>
&gt;no commercial yoghurt (except the flavoured ones) contains more<BR>
&gt;than seven percent carbohydrates (the flavoured ones around fifteen).<BR>
&gt;Recently, there was a discussion/comparison on yoghurt preparation<BR>
&gt;time. How about this: Two minutes to wash the container, one minute<BR>
&gt;to pour in the yoghurt and put it in the oven - a total time of<BR>
&gt;three minutes. Try to beat that if you can!<BR>

&gt;What is the experience of you guys with dry wine? I know &quot;the book&quot;<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Does it agree with you?<BR>

Alcohol, period, does not agree with me.  Luckily I've never enjoyed it<BR>
either except for a very rare summertime glass of beer with pizza or<BR>
something like that.  <BR>
<BR>
Notice she wrote &quot;dry&quot;.  That's because alcohol as such is a refined<BR>
carbohydrate aka &quot;sugar&quot;, thus it would ferment in your system and give<BR>
good feeding ground for all those bugs we're trying to starve out.<BR>
<BR>
The reason she says &quot;dry&quot; is because the &quot;dryness&quot; (meaning &quot;least sweet&quot;)<BR>
means those are the wines with the lowest sugar content, thus they will be<BR>
the most &quot;tart&quot;, even &quot;sour&quot;.<BR>

You're  not actually doing anything &quot;wrong&quot; ... the problem is, the way I<BR>
see it (and I agree, it is rather scrambled), you're not using a dedicated<BR>
e-mailer to compose the messages (or IS &quot;Lotus Notes&quot; an e-mailer?  I<BR>
thought it was a word-processor?)  <BR>
<BR>
I use &quot;Eudora&quot;; the other world-wide popular e-mailer is &quot;Pegasus&quot; (the<BR>
former has a freeware version, the latter is free, period).  Netscape also<BR>
has an e-mailer built-in, though I don't use it.<BR>
<BR>
If you use any of these, your e-mails will most likely look exaclty as you<BR>
see them, which is definitely easier on the recipient, right?<BR>

 <BR>
No.  The alcohol in beer, wine, and spirits is ethenol.  It is NOT a<BR>
carbohydrate.  It is a metabolic by-product of glycolysis under anaerobic<BR>
conditions (carbohydrate digestion), a different chemical species.  The<BR>
distinction between dry and sweet wines is due to incomplete digestion of<BR>
carbohydrates by the introduced yeast (aka incomplete fermentation) which<BR>
leaves residual sugars, most of which is probably fructose.  In much the<BR>
same way that we make completely-fermented yogurt where all the lactose is<BR>
consumed, one can make wine in which virtually all the sugars are consumed<BR>
(and converted to energy, ethenol, lactic acid, and glycerol).  Alcohol in<BR>
one's system will not &quot;ferment&quot; since it is already an end-product of the<BR>
fermentation process.<BR>
<BR>
Beer is very similar to wine but it is not allowed on the SCD diet because<BR>
it depends on incomplete fermentation to be carbonated, same with champagne.<BR>
Spirits are different because they're distilled, another process.  The<BR>
spirits that Elaine lists as &quot;legal&quot; (scotch, whiskey, ....) are ones that<BR>
do not have sugary-substances blended with them after distillation.<BR>
<BR>
I am a 19-month veteren of the SCD and a have had ups and downs but the<BR>
overall trend has been steady, remarkable improvement.  Right now, I live<BR>
day to day with NO chron's symptoms.  I drink the occasional (2-3 drinks a<BR>
week max) dry or semi-dry wine and scotch and soda with no ill effects<BR>
whatsoever.  My opinion is that since alcohol can irritate, experimentation<BR>
should wait until you've been on the diet long enough for symptoms to subside.<BR>

P.S.  As a former enthusiastic home-brewer I have an idea for SCD-legal<BR>
beer.  If there are any other former home-brewers that would like to discuss<BR>

Hi All,<BR>
<BR>
I just thought of something that happened to me when I read this passage.<BR>
<BR>
A year and a half ago I had my blood tested and it that showed that my white<BR>
cell blood count was low and that a couple of enzyme levels were elevate in<BR>
my liver.  Just before I went on the SCD in July my gastroentrologist<BR>
checked out my blood to see if these conditions still existed. They did. So<BR>
I was scheduled for a liver biopsy for the following month. In the mean time<BR>
I went on the SCD and had been on the diet for a month when I went in for<BR>
the liver biopsy. The doctor drew some more blood and found that my white<BR>
cell blood count and all of my liver's enzyme levels were normal.<BR>
<BR>
He asked me what had changed. I told him that I started this SCD diet and<BR>
had lost 20 lbs in the process (this weight that I needed to lose). To that<BR>
he said that whatever I did, it was the right move and that I should keep it<BR>
up. He also said there was no reason for me to have a liver biopsy since the<BR>
blood situation had straightened itself out. He told me that high<BR>
cholesterol caused the problems that were in my blood. He told me to have<BR>
another blood test in December to make sure that my blood is still in good<BR>
shape. I have no doubt that the next blood test will be normal.<BR>
<BR>
I say this because I'm probably consuming as much fat now as I did before I<BR>
went on the SCD, yet my cholesterol level dropped down into the normal<BR>
range. I eat a heck of a lot of cheddar cheese, eggs, and other fat laden<BR>
foods. I'd say from my own experience that the SCD is a very healthy diet.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Regarding cholesterol, mine was so low awhile back that it was below 100. I<BR>
&gt;was congratulated by the nurse and doctor. Very shortly thereafter, I was<BR>
&gt;diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Someone on another list said that the idea of  cholesterol figures were<BR>
made<BR>
&gt;up by the pharmaceutical industry to sell drugs.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
To all,<BR>
<BR>
Just a side note. I've been told that the high colesterol hype was seezed<BR>
upon by margerine business interests. When margerine made its debut a couple<BR>
of decades ago, there was no market for the stuff. So the industry started<BR>
hyping low fat diets to get people to switch from butter to margerine. I<BR>
don't know if this is fact or fiction, but if it's fact, then market<BR>
interests are behind a lot of the hype. We all know how business and profit<BR>
go hand-in-hand (even when it calls for deceptive marketing tactics).<BR>

&gt;Dietmar took the words right out of my mouth. what is going on here is<BR>
&quot;they&quot;<BR>
&gt;want us sick. so they make this low-fat crap because we are ignorant enough<BR>
to<BR>
&gt;buy it. everyone is on a low-fat fad craze. its not fat that makes us sick<BR>
and<BR>
&gt;puts us in the hospital. IT IS REFINED SUGAR. so, what they do is remove<BR>
the<BR>
&gt;fat and add the sugar KNOWING we shouldnt be eating it and what it will end<BR>
up<BR>
&gt;doing long term. and look now at how many people are sick.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Joan<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
More appropriately, I don't know that the medical community wants us sick as<BR>
much as producers of low fat foods want more profit. Many doctors in the<BR>
medical community just stick to what they believe which is based on<BR>
scientific studies that they read about. If a study hasn't been conducted<BR>
that uses the proper protocals, then the main stream medical professionals<BR>
don't want to embrace the alternative ways that may improve our health.<BR>

just wondering ?<BR>
<BR>
do flares and such intensify when &quot;still losing weight&quot; on the SCD and<BR>
do things seem to get better when weight normalizes ? does SCD seem to<BR>
work best for underweight dieters ?<BR>
<BR>
what if the problem Deanna reported and the fact that this diet does not<BR>
seem to work for everyone is due to weight loss and the freeing of Arachidonic<BR>
acid into the blood from the fat cells, the Arachidonic acid plagued<BR>
me when i lost 38lbs and i took lots of fish oil to combat it. (before dieting<BR>
i only had pain/cramps/constipation followed D, my son has colitis, i have been<BR>
normal for over a year, my son just started diet control for colitis)<BR>
<BR>
the arachidonic acid is a real deal for me, i eat read meat and i can tell<BR>
it from the consistency of my bowel the next day, i eat three eggs and<BR>
i wont have a BM for two to three days. i know this because three out of<BR>
the four meals i eat daily are the same every day every meal, the only<BR>
variation is the fourth, it is almost always chicken/vegatables. <BR>

Hello everyone!!<BR>
<BR>
I would like to thank you all who offered me advice.<BR>
<BR>
I phoned Elaine this morning and she told me that pretty much I am doing OK,<BR>
just cut down on dates perhaps. One month is too soon to get dramatic results,<BR>
and the fact that my arthritis pain and most of the bloating has gone away is<BR>
great improvement for the time being.<BR>
<BR>
Also, she told me that Asacol is a medical joke, and is totally useless.<BR>
However, she recommended Azulfidine in small doses.  Last year I took 3 a day<BR>
and was violently ill and had to stop on the 3rd day.  Elaine said that was<BR>
because I was put on large doses immediately, and she is going to fax me a<BR>
research article on the proper dosage of the drug to show my doctor.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding psyllium, she recommeded I stay off it for the time being and see<BR>
what happens.<BR>
<BR>
Lastly, she sends her best wishes to every one in the group, and feels<BR>
terrible about the 'disagreements' that had been going on that caused some<BR>
veteran group members to drop out.  She hopes you all will get along and help<BR>
eachother for the sake of what the list stands for.<BR>

Just curious,  what was you cholesterol before and after SCD?  What did<BR>
your doc consider &quot;normal&quot;?<BR>

&gt; &gt;Huggins says for many, many decades 220-225 was considered ideal and<BR>
&gt; &gt;normative.  He also says if he can get people off white sugar and<BR>
&gt; &gt;refined carbos, and then get them to eat at least 2 eggs per day and<BR>
&gt; up<BR>
&gt; &gt;to 1/4 pound of butter that whether or not not they are high or low,<BR>
&gt; &gt;their cholesterol will eventually normalize around 220.<BR>

&gt; Hi All,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I just thought of something that happened to me when I read this<BR>
&gt; passage.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; A year and a half ago I had my blood tested and it that showed that my<BR>
&gt; white<BR>
&gt; cell blood count was low and that a couple of enzyme levels were<BR>
&gt; elevate in<BR>
&gt; my liver.  Just before I went on the SCD in July my gastroentrologist<BR>
&gt; checked out my blood to see if these conditions still existed. They<BR>
&gt; did. So<BR>
&gt; I was scheduled for a liver biopsy for the following month. In the<BR>
&gt; mean time<BR>
&gt; I went on the SCD and had been on the diet for a month when I went in<BR>
&gt; for<BR>
&gt; the liver biopsy. The doctor drew some more blood and found that my<BR>
&gt; white<BR>
&gt; cell blood count and all of my liver's enzyme levels were normal.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; He asked me what had changed. I told him that I started this SCD diet<BR>
&gt; and<BR>
&gt; had lost 20 lbs in the process (this weight that I needed to lose). To<BR>
&gt; that<BR>
&gt; he said that whatever I did, it was the right move and that I should<BR>
&gt; keep it<BR>
&gt; up. He also said there was no reason for me to have a liver biopsy<BR>
&gt; since the<BR>
&gt; blood situation had straightened itself out. He told me that high<BR>
&gt; cholesterol caused the problems that were in my blood. He told me to<BR>
&gt; have<BR>
&gt; another blood test in December to make sure that my blood is still in<BR>
&gt; good<BR>
&gt; shape. I have no doubt that the next blood test will be normal.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I say this because I'm probably consuming as much fat now as I did<BR>
&gt; before I<BR>
&gt; went on the SCD, yet my cholesterol level dropped down into the normal<BR>
&gt; range. I eat a heck of a lot of cheddar cheese, eggs, and other fat<BR>
&gt; laden<BR>
&gt; foods. I'd say from my own experience that the SCD is a very healthy<BR>
&gt; diet.<BR>

True, but many of the studies that they base there thinking on are<BR>
conducted by people like the margarine industry and extremely flawed and<BR>
hardly scientific.  They have the money though to make them look<BR>
scientific and to hype the reults to the media and the mdeical community<BR>
which doe get the docs attention.  Thus they end up believeing something<BR>
that is false.  Deception only really works when it is mixed with a<BR>
healthy dose of truth.  It is still deception.  <BR>

&gt; More appropriately, I don't know that the medical community wants us<BR>

&gt; much as producers of low fat foods want more profit. Many doctors in<BR>

&gt; Hello everyone!!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I would like to thank you all who offered me advice.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I phoned Elaine this morning and she told me that pretty much I am doing OK,<BR>
&gt; just cut down on dates perhaps. One month is too soon to get dramatic results,<BR>
&gt; and the fact that my arthritis pain and most of the bloating has gone away is<BR>
&gt; great improvement for the time being.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, she told me that Asacol is a medical joke, and is totally useless.<BR>
&gt; However, she recommended Azulfidine in small doses.  Last year I took 3 a day<BR>
&gt; and was violently ill and had to stop on the 3rd day.  Elaine said that was<BR>
&gt; because I was put on large doses immediately, and she is going to fax me a<BR>
&gt; research article on the proper dosage of the drug to show my doctor.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Regarding psyllium, she recommeded I stay off it for the time being and see<BR>
&gt; what happens.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Lastly, she sends her best wishes to every one in the group, and feels<BR>
&gt; terrible about the 'disagreements' that had been going on that caused some<BR>
&gt; veteran group members to drop out.  She hopes you all will get along and help<BR>
&gt; eachother for the sake of what the list stands for.<BR>

According to my cook books, split peas do not have a skin and are small, =<BR>
so they can be rehydrated by cooking and don't require soaking.  I have =<BR>
made split pea soup a few times, but now I wonder if it really is =<BR>
allowed?  I've also made refried beans using pinto beans.  I love them, =<BR>
but I don't think they are allowed either. =20<BR>

&gt;&gt;Regarding cholesterol, mine was so low awhile back that it was below 100. I<BR>
&gt;&gt;was congratulated by the nurse and doctor. Very shortly thereafter, I was<BR>
&gt;&gt;diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt;Someone on another list said that the idea of  cholesterol figures were<BR>
&gt;made<BR>
&gt;&gt;up by the pharmaceutical industry to sell drugs.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;To all,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Just a side note. I've been told that the high colesterol hype was seezed<BR>
&gt;upon by margerine business interests. When margerine made its debut a couple<BR>
&gt;of decades ago, there was no market for the stuff. So the industry started<BR>
&gt;hyping low fat diets to get people to switch from butter to margerine. I<BR>
&gt;don't know if this is fact or fiction, but if it's fact, then market<BR>
&gt;interests are behind a lot of the hype. We all know how business and profit<BR>
&gt;go hand-in-hand (even when it calls for deceptive marketing tactics).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Glenn<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Story of Margarine&quot;:<BR>
<BR>
- invented by the Germans during World War II when they had a shortage of<BR>
dairy products; it was a terrible tasting product, made from refined veg.<BR>
oils, but what can you do when there's no 7-11 around, eh?  The word<BR>
&quot;margarine&quot;, according to my dictionary, comes from &quot;margaric acid&quot;, a type<BR>
of fatty acid that's in lichens &amp; some veg oils)<BR>
<BR>
- the idea was also taken on by the Allies, especially the Brits &amp; the<BR>
Canadians (the latter having to export all their goodies to the Yank &amp; Brit<BR>
war machine: butter fat was an essential ingredient for producing some<BR>
material or lubrication or something, so very little was available for<BR>
civilians), who called it &quot;oleo-margarine&quot;.  <BR>
<BR>
Because it was such a sickly-looking imitation of butter, (so an 80-ish<BR>
friend of the family tells me), they packed a little container of food<BR>
colouring (made from coal tar, just like all the other good food colouring<BR>
we have in foods today!) along with it; when you got it home, you mixed it<BR>
up to give it a &quot;healthy&quot; yellow colour.  (They hadn't figured out yet how<BR>
to make the colour stay mixed at the oleo-factory, so it would separate out<BR>
&amp; look all streaky when they tried it at first)<BR>
<BR>
- Then, of course, came the &quot;health food 60's&quot;, and the industrial-food<BR>
complex figured out they could do an endrun around cows &amp; dairy farmers<BR>
while also leeching off the health craze, so they &quot;re-invented&quot;,<BR>
re-engineered, and rehabilitated margarine to make is sound like an<BR>
up-scale, health-wise thing to have on your table.  <BR>
<BR>
I guess ol' Bessie on the farm is glad to have us back!  She must have been<BR>
feeling udder-ly lonely with everyone rejecting her.  Can you say &quot;Moo&quot;<BR>
with a smile on you face?<BR>

and baking, and i found a stack of papers that Matthew had left when he was<BR>
doing his homework earlier this evening. They were compositions for his<BR>
english class, memoirs. One dealt with his old rocking horse which he still<BR>
remembers fondly, the other was a surprise. It was called &quot;Something Evil,&quot;<BR>
and it was about his experience this year with the thing that has come to<BR>
dominate our lives: Crohn's Disease, and about the diet he is on now as<BR>
aresult. I'm typing it up so that I can have it later. My 12 year old is<BR>
one great kid. I wanted to share it for some reason<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Something Evil&quot;<BR>
<BR>
        Something evil got into me this year, into my stomach. And I<BR>
couldn't run, and I couldnt wear my shoes, had to wear sandals every day.<BR>
<BR>
Frustrating? You don't know about frustrating. This thing wasn't my fault,<BR>
but that still did'nt change the fact that it was there, and I could do<BR>
nothing at all to fix it.<BR>
<BR>
        We kept going to the doctor for all kinds of checkups. There was<BR>
even a time when I couldn't eat solid food for two days. Somehow, that got<BR>
scheduled for the day we had pizza on a school field trip. They had pizza.<BR>
<BR>
        And then came steroids. A mild amount, but that's what they were.<BR>
Boy. did I feel great! I thought I was all better; until we started edging<BR>
off the medication a week at a time. Turns out steroids don't exactly have<BR>
a lasting effect.<BR>
<BR>
        Things happened real slow, but I'm better now (knock on wood). Of<BR>
course I can't eat a lot of foods, especially stuff that's not made at my<BR>
house. I guess that's just yet another challenge in my life. I never<BR>
thought I'd be on a diet at age twelve, but if it means I get to be me<BR>
again, believe me, I'll get used to it.<BR>

<BR>
&quot;Injections of an antibody that targets a natural human protein are showing <BR>

illness.<BR>
The treatment involves injections of an antibody called cA2.  It neutralizes <BR>

Hi Everyone - <BR>
<BR>
I just started on SCD on Sunday.  Based on the difficulty I am having<BR>
figuring out what to eat, it makes me realize that my old diet seemed to<BR>
be based on everything I can't have now.  No wonder I'm so sick!  <BR>
<BR>
I started the diet on Sunday and on last night (Tuesday) I found out I<BR>
was pregnant.  Has anybody had experience with SCD while being pregnant?<BR>
 Is it a bad idea to start the diet while pregnant?  I don't feel I can<BR>
ask my gastroenterologist because she told me there is absolutely no<BR>
relationship between food and ulcerative colitis.  From my own<BR>
experience running to the bathroom after eating something sugary, I know<BR>
she's wrong.<BR>
<BR>
Does anybody have any SCD pregnancy experience they can tell me about?<BR>
<BR>
thanks, <BR>
<BR>
Fiona<BR>

Dear Jacenta,<BR>
<BR>
Thank you so much for the information.<BR>
<BR>
Another scientist, Dr Wakefield in the U.K, has found Crohn's to be linked<BR>
to the MMR vaccine.  He is currently risking his job trying to get this<BR>
research published. ( It is apparently not popular to publish info adverse<BR>
to mandatory vaccine programs!)<BR>
<BR>
I also read that Crohn's can be helped by Pro Biotics such as Nature's<BR>
Biotics or a similar Soil Based Organisms.<BR>
<BR>
The reason as I understand it is that the MMR can introduce viruses into the<BR>
intestinal tract which lodge themselves in there and disrupt the functioning<BR>
of the colon, turning it into a hamburger meat- like texture.<BR>
<BR>
The soil based organisms work to dislodge these organisms.<BR>
<BR>
I know I have not explained it well, but this is how it was explained to me.<BR>
Anyway, many have been cured of Crohns by going on soil based organisms.<BR>
<BR>
I have no financial connection to this therapy.<BR>

Lucy,<BR>
<BR>
Having grown wine grapes commercially since the early 70's, I felt compelled to correct your<BR>
misconceptions of &quot;dry&quot; vs. alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
The term dry for wine refers to its residual sugar content. A sweet wine still has sugar in <BR>
it while a dry wine has none. We care about the sugar obviously. The alcohol content is<BR>
really a different thing and a dry wine could have low or high alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
Wine is made by fermenting ripe grapes. One of the criteria for deciding when to harvest<BR>
the grapes is the sugar content of the grapes. The fermentation process turns the sugar into <BR>
alcohol at the rate of 2 to 1. So, if you harvest grapes at 24% sugar and ferment it dry, then<BR>
you will end up with 12% alcohol wine. If you fermented it to 10% alcohol and then stopped<BR>
it, you would have used 20% sugar and thus the finished wine would have 4% residual sugar.<BR>
<BR>
So in that respect, you might say that the 12% alcohol wine had less sugar than the 10% wine,<BR>
but that is only if both wines started with 24% sugar grapes. The 10% wine could just as easily<BR>
have started with 20% sugar grapes and be dry, or the 12% alcohol wine could have started with<BR>
26% sugar grapes and still be sweet.<BR>
<BR>
You can't know anything other than the description of dry, semi-dry, etc. unless you have a<BR>
sugar test kit. <BR>
<BR>
Since grape juice is OK, I wonder how much harm the residual sugar in wine would cause.<BR>
If the grapes are low sugar at harvest time,  sugar can be added during fermentation. <BR>
In that case, any residual sugar could be part sucrose. So I suppose that only drinking wine<BR>
with no residual sugar would be the best way to know for sure. <BR>

If Elaine could package the SCD diet as a patented drug, it would be a<BR>

The cholesterol reducing drugs, when they work, decrease cholesterol<BR>

as has been recently stated on this list, low cholesterol levels lead to<BR>
problems, but is that true if you are eating a healthy diet , the data<BR>
that says it's a problem for sure wasn't from people who ate the SCD diet,<BR>
so its hard to tell what is the best level. i have read that cholesterol is regulated<BR>
in the cell (not in the blood) execess blood levels are reduced when insulin (sugar)<BR>
is low, the cell goes to its membrane and gets it from the blood, in the presence<BR>
of high levels of insulin the cell simply makes its own cholesterol. of course<BR>
you can still have a glycemic event by eating too much protein at any one time, its<BR>
not just the simple/complex sugars that can spike your insulin level.<BR>

Hi all,<BR>
<BR>
While shopping today I made a note of the ingredients in both Dry <BR>
Curd Cottage Cheese and Bakers Cheese.  Also peeked under the lid to <BR>
not the visible differences.  The brand name on both products was <BR>
Formost.<BR>
<BR>
DCCC - Milk ingredients, Microbial enzymes and Bacterial Culture.<BR>
<BR>
Bakers Cheese - Milk ingredients, Bacterial Culture, Rennet, <BR>
Potassium Sorbate.  <BR>
<BR>
DCCC has a cottage cheese look without any of the moisture.  Bakers <BR>
Cheese was creamy like a riccotta.<BR>
<BR>
Here in Vancouver where Formost is one of the 'big' suppliers of <BR>
dairy products I would say that these two products are completely <BR>
different.<BR>

For your information :-)<BR>

have moderate high cholesterol (240).  Do you think the scd diet will take<BR>
care of that?  I'm so tired of being tired.  Thanks, Jane.<BR>

Don't know for sure.  All I know is that I have read a couple of<BR>
different books on it and nobody seems to know what normal is anymore<BR>
since the cholesterol scare.  Huggins said that his observations after<BR>
reading over 1 million blood tests was that 220-225 was what he<BR>
considers normal and in fact aims his patient at that level.  Says on<BR>
the diet he considers to be healthful, that his patients inevitably head<BR>
towards that balance whether they were low or high.  Says many other<BR>
researces have concluded this same range for many decades?  Eggs and<BR>
butter are both acceptable SCD foods.  Best I know...<BR>

&gt; cholesterol is regulated<BR>
&gt; in the cell (not in the blood) execess blood levels are reduced when<BR>
&gt; insulin (sugar)<BR>
&gt; is low, the cell goes to its membrane and gets it from the blood, in<BR>
&gt; the presence<BR>
&gt; of high levels of insulin the cell simply makes its own cholesterol.<BR>
&gt; of course<BR>
&gt; you can still have a glycemic event by eating too much protein at any<BR>

&gt; not just the simple/complex sugars that can spike your insulin level.<BR>

Subject: SDC - Spanish Cheese Question<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;s46091dd.024@umich.edu&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone know if Spanish cheese is okay on the SCD?  It has the same<BR>
consistency as farmers cheese (DCCC) but tastes a little tarter.  I<BR>
don't know much about it because I buy it at Arabic markets here in<BR>
Detroit and usually only the words &quot;spanish cheese&quot; are written in<BR>
English.<BR>
<BR>
If anybody knows I'd love to get an answer.  It's a mild cheese that<BR>
makes great cheese fajitas (now without the tortilla's but it would<BR>
still be yummy!)<BR>

Hi!<BR>
<BR>
Someone I know through a mothers' group locally referred me to the SCD. I<BR>
am having once-twice daily diarrhea which seems to be a complete system<BR>
flush, a small amount of bleeding, stomach cramps, fatigue, nipple thrush<BR>
(though I haven't been nursing for almost 3 months), and private parts<BR>
itching. I have been following the diet faithfully since 10/19/97, along<BR>
with taking a supplement called Paragone and Parazyme for possible<BR>
parasites. Things seem to be improving slightly thanks to the diet- I am<BR>
no longer consuming vast quantities of food with weight loss/difficulty<BR>
maintaining, am not always starving, and the fatigue has gotten somewhat<BR>
better. Still have sleep problems. I don't have an official diagnosis,<BR>
although the colonoscopy biopsy results indicate chronic inflammatory<BR>
disease. My gastro doc believess I have a bacterial infection or Crohns<BR>
or colitis. Because I have had pretty severe yeast problems, I am<BR>
reluctant to take Cipro (antibiotic). I have taken 2 rounds of goldenseal<BR>
root (herb), which is a strong antibiotic (without the yeast<BR>
proliferation problem) and nothing really changed.<BR>
<BR>
My questions, for anyone who can help me, are:<BR>
Are there a lot of people with Crohns/colitis who also are afflicted with<BR>
candida? Are the two related? Do they go hand in hand? <BR>
Have others found that antibiotic therapy is ever really beneficial in<BR>
this situation?<BR>
Are those with Crohns/UC and candida problems able to eat cheese or any<BR>
dairy products?<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, the person who directed me to this diet wants to know if<BR>
you are allowed to have raisins, since grapes are contraindicated. (My<BR>
friend doesn't have an internet connection.)<BR>
<BR>
I am so glad to have found this site. Thanks to the people who started it<BR>
and maintain it. It is a godsend.<BR>

My gastro advised me to take the Cipro for 10 days, then go to azulfadine<BR>
(sp?) if the Cipro didn't work. He doesn't really seem to know exactly<BR>
what he's treating, so it makes me doubly reluctant to take the cipro,<BR>
just to take it to see if it MIGHT work. <BR>

Dear Moira,<BR>
<BR>
Re Dry Curd Cottage Cheese in the Bay area, you're in luck!!!! I live in<BR>
the Bay Area, Marin County, and in SF you can get it from<BR>
<BR>
Country Cheese Co.<BR>
415 Divisadero St.<BR>
SF 94117<BR>
tele. # 621-8130<BR>
<BR>
They will ship frozen, also.  And, I understand their prices are more<BR>
reasonable than some of the other stores in the Bay Area, i.e., Whole<BR>
Foods, $4.49/lb.; Andronico's, $5.99/lb!<BR>
<BR>
I called Friendship Dairies (no. on page 147 of the Book) under New York<BR>
State, and talked to someone in the lab who told me that it is made with<BR>
skimmed milk and has less than l/2 of 1 percent of lactose in it; 99% fat<BR>
free, and tastes wonderful...this brand...very mild and soft-tasting.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
In addition<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Dear Lucy,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;My son is helping me in the kitchen. His favorite task is helping with green<BR>
&gt;beans, he cuts off the ends (with a dull knife!) He also loves helping when<BR>
&gt;I do the food processor, I let him turn it on for me.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Somewhere I read that the average housewife used to spend 2 to 3 hours per<BR>
&gt;day on food preparation. Now it is under 20 minutes.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I think I am up to about 8 hours per day of food preparation--just<BR>
&gt;kidding--but it seems like it by comparison. Bye bye Burger King.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Moira<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;ps Does anyone know where to get dry curd cottage cheese in the San<BR>
&gt;Francisco Bay Area? Also, can a child have it who is allergic to dairy?? Are<BR>
&gt;there any people here on the list who live in the Bay Area??<BR>

Read your message about hypoglycemia. I too have Low Blood Sugar. I've been<BR>
on the SCD since Sept. 27th and I can say that I immediately began feeling<BR>
more energetic.  However, I still need to eat protein between meals and I<BR>
try to have a piece of fruit late in the afternoon so I can make it until<BR>
dinner time. My doctor told me I can (or should) eat protein up to 5 times<BR>
a day. When I do that I don't experience any of the shakes or faintness<BR>
from the low blood sugar.<BR>

Just FYI<BR>

You have mentioned the book &quot;The Zone&quot; several times. It sounds very<BR>
interesting so when I was at the health food store last night I looked for<BR>
it in their book section. The have 2 different books by Barry Sears; 1-<BR>
&quot;Enter The Zone&quot;, copyright 1995; and &quot;Mastering The Zone copyright 1997.<BR>
<BR>
Each was marked as $25.00 USD. Which one should I get or both? - Which<BR>
should I read first? And do you think I could find them less expensive?<BR>
They were hardbound versions.<BR>
<BR>
Suggestions welcome,<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Alright folks I've been holding out. Ive been on the diet for almost 11<BR>
&gt;months and think that I have a solution to the big &quot;D&quot;.  Now this may not<BR>
&gt;work for everyone and I certainly dont represent any herbal stores, but I<BR>
&gt;recently went to a herbal store and found a product that has completely taken<BR>
&gt;the &quot;D&quot; out of my BM's.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I originally went to get some psyillium because I thought that would<BR>
&gt;help---But the clerk suggested a product called CLT-X which consists of<BR>
&gt;slippery elm bark, marshmellow root, dong quai root, and some yam root,. and<BR>
&gt;ginger root.  What a beautiful combination-it worked like magic.  The product<BR>
&gt;I take is made by Natures Sunshine and I hope it works for you as well as it<BR>
&gt;did for me.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have unsubscribed because my E-mails have become too plenty, and I seem to<BR>
&gt;get many messages twice.  If anyone wants any further information you can<BR>
&gt;personally E-mail me at jps3450@aol.com<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Good luck<BR>
&gt;By the way I have UC for 15 years and think that SCD is healing me.  To those<BR>
&gt;of you that are considering cheating.....DONT DO IT!!!<BR>
&gt;<BR>

&gt;As a matter of fact, ther are other members in the SF bay area. I live in<BR>

&gt;matthew(12) was diagnossed with CD earlier this year, so I also am here as<BR>
&gt;the parent of a dieter. Anyway I buy baker's cheese in San Francisco at a<BR>
&gt;cheese store at 415 Divisadero called The Country Cheese Co. The phone #<BR>
&gt;is:621-8130. If your son is allergic to lactose, then this cheese should be<BR>
&gt;OK. There is almost none in it. If he is allergic to milk protein or<BR>
&gt;something like that, then it might be a different story. I also have a<BR>

Dear Jan,<BR>

Although I have one wonderful sister, I wish I had another just like you to<BR>
support me the way you are supporting with such love your sister.<BR>
<BR>
Prateeksha<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Dear FANTASTIC list members,<BR>
&gt;Today you all receive a GIANT hug and kiss from a very grateful sister<BR>
&gt;of a CD sufferer.<BR>
&gt;Karen is 30 yrs old and was diagnosed with CD at age 18. She has had 5<BR>
&gt;operations,<BR>
&gt;bowel resections, fistula problems, etc. You all know the score. And she<BR>
&gt;puts up with<BR>
&gt;at least 5 to 6 hospital stays per year. However, this past June, her CD<BR>
&gt;became worse<BR>
&gt;than ever (terrible D, joint pain that could not be controlled, etc.)<BR>
&gt;Her doctors<BR>
&gt;decided their only course of action was to up her predinisone levels<BR>
&gt;considerably to<BR>
&gt;stop the D and then cut the dosage in half. This brought on severe<BR>
&gt;migraine headaches<BR>
&gt;that not even Demerol or morphine could stop.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Unfortunately, my sister has always tried to deny the existence of her<BR>
&gt;disease and<BR>
&gt;blindly follow whatever her doctors prescribed. But I was tired of<BR>
&gt;seeing the pro-<BR>
&gt;fessionals use her as their prime guinea pig, and went to work on my own<BR>
&gt;seeking out<BR>
&gt;new info on the net (somehow that sounds rather Star-Trek like, doesn't<BR>
&gt;it?) Luckily,<BR>
&gt;I stumbled onto this group and ordered Elaine's book.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Karen is currently without-computer, so I sent her &quot;THE BOOK&quot; and have<BR>
&gt;been bombarding<BR>
&gt;her ever since with copies of your postings via snail-mail. I ordered a<BR>
&gt;yogurt maker<BR>
&gt;from Williams Sonoma, ordered the almond nut flour from Hughsons and<BR>
&gt;found sources for<BR>
&gt;the dry curd cheese.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;After two months, she has finally started the SCD and I'm anxiously<BR>
&gt;awaiting word of<BR>
&gt;how it is going for her. I will keep you posted and also pass on any<BR>
&gt;questions she has.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;FINALLY, I must thank you all again!!! It was not my &quot;nagging&quot; that<BR>
&gt;convinced her to<BR>
&gt;take back her own health and try something new, but all the messages<BR>
&gt;from people who<BR>
&gt;have &quot;been there&quot;.  I think she's always felt so alone with her CD, she<BR>
&gt;has never<BR>
&gt;talked with other people who have it. The change in her attitude has<BR>
&gt;been remarkable.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;P.S. I'm sure you get tired of being asked this, but any words of<BR>
&gt;encouragement you could offer Karen would be GREATLY appreciated. You<BR>
&gt;are all my Heroes!! Thanks!!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;A sincerely grateful sister,<BR>

Hi Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I realize this is terribly lengthy, but feel it to be very important.<BR>
First, it came from my network chiro; then from a friend who is very<BR>
supportive of the holistic approch to healing.<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;Greetings everyone....<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;This was just received and I invite you to participate in this action if<BR>
&gt;you are drawn to do so. This impacts all of us in the Holistic Health<BR>
&gt;Fields. Thank you for your participation.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Warm thoughts,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Vita<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Please direct this mail to everyone you can think of ASAP! It concerns<BR>
&gt;the right to use vitamin supplements and therapeutic dosages of herbal<BR>
&gt;remedies, food supplements and generally all forms of healing methods based<BR>
&gt;on<BR>
&gt;non-pharmaceutical approaches! It is NO JOKE.  We are about to lose our<BR>
&gt;hard won health freedoms RIGHT NOW.  This message has been updated 10/21/97.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;YOU MAY LOSE THE RIGHT TO YOUR VITAMINS, HERBS, AND OTHER SUPPLEMENTS IN<BR>
&gt;LESS THAN TWO WEEKS!!!<BR>
&gt;An insidious bill, called the CODEX LAW or CODEX ALIMENTARIUS, has<BR>
&gt;already been sneaked through both the Senate and the House of Representatives<BR>
&gt;in<BR>
&gt;record time.  It has been passed by both houses.  The Codex is a nutrition<BR>
&gt;code to set worldwide standards for foods, drugs, pesticides and their<BR>
&gt;trade. The latest German proposal includes the following provisions:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;1. No vitamin, mineral, herb or food supplement can be sold for<BR>
&gt;preventative or therapeutic use.<BR>
&gt; 2. None sold as a food can exceed dosage levels set by the Commission. For<BR>
&gt;example, 50 mg of vitamin C is the top dosage sold in Germany today.<BR>
&gt;3. CODEX regulations for dietary supplements would become legally<BR>
&gt;binding in the USA through the GATT Treaty, which would involve enormous<BR>
&gt;fines in America if we did not comply.<BR>
&gt;4. All new dietary supplements will be banned unless they pass the<BR>
&gt;CODEX approval process.  You can imagine what that means.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The wording in the Congressional Bill uses the term &quot;harmonization&quot; which<BR>
&gt;means that most senators and congresspersons are likely not aware of the<BR>
&gt;implications. The delegates that make up and decide on the CODEX mandates<BR>
&gt;are made up of 90% of the giant Multi-national Pharmaceutical corporations.<BR>
&gt;The drug<BR>
&gt;companies want to monopolize and create pharmaceutical versions of the<BR>
&gt;Natural healthfood and nutrient business throughout the world. An<BR>
&gt;example of the consequences:  possession of DHEA is now a felony in Canada<BR>
&gt;with<BR>
&gt;the same penalty as that for possession of drugs.  You could go to jail for<BR>
&gt;having DHEA in your house.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You have LESS THAN 10 DAYS to save your vitamins! The latest development as<BR>
&gt;of 10/18/97 is that the House and Senate are now voting on a 3rd merged<BR>
&gt;version of the Codex Bill. (The House Companion Bill).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;What you need to do now is very simple.<BR>
&gt;1.  First, pick up your phone and call 1-800-972-3524.  This is the<BR>
&gt;Congressional switchboard.  Leave a message for your Senators AND your<BR>
&gt;Representatives.  Request that the Harmonization Language in the FDA<BR>
&gt;Reform Bill be amended when it goes to the Conference Committee.  State that<BR>
&gt;you<BR>
&gt;oppose to Codex Bill and any attempt to regulate nutritioinal supplements as<BR>
&gt;drugs.  This committee, as far as we know, will be meeting THIS WEEK, the<BR>
&gt;week of 10/21.  Also state that you request a public comments period<BR>
&gt;concerning the harmonization agreements.<BR>
&gt;2.  Please telephone, fax, and email everyone you can think of.  Make a<BR>
&gt;phone tree.  Email everyone on your list.  Send them this information and<BR>
&gt;ask them to make calls as well.  To stay updated on what to do, email<BR>
&gt;Jham@concentric.net and request to be put in his distribution list.  Or,<BR>
&gt;call John Hammel at 1-800-333-2553 for a recorded message.  (I believe<BR>
&gt;this is the correct email address.  Try all lower case if it doesn't work.<BR>
&gt;The address is given in John's phone message.)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You can read the information below if you wish.  But the important<BR>
&gt;thing is to act, before it's too late.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;CODEX: What does it mean?<BR>
&gt;Although written by a prominent Canadian M.D., the article below, one of<BR>
&gt;the best we have read on the topic, was distributed by a U.S. group seeking<BR>
&gt;to stop the CODEX in the U.S. The CODEX affects the U.S., Canada, and all<BR>
&gt;member nations of the U.N. We urge you to read it and decide if maybe, just<BR>
&gt;maybe, it's finally time for you to use the democractic process TODAY to<BR>
&gt;preserve the future of you and your family TOMORROW.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;&quot;If you value freedom of choice in health care, it may still not be too<BR>
&gt;late for you to help stop the pending world wide suppression of<BR>
&gt;Complementary Medicine. If the Codex Alimentarius (Nutrition Code)<BR>
&gt;Commission has its way, then herbs, vitamins, minerals, homeopathic<BR>
&gt;remedies, amino acids and other natural remedies you have taken for granted<BR>
&gt;most of your life will be gone. The name of the game for Codex is to shift<BR>
&gt;all remedies under the prescription category that would be controlled<BR>
&gt;exclusively by the medical monopoly and its bosses, the major<BR>
&gt;pharmaceutical firms. This scenario, predictably, has been denied by both<BR>
&gt;the Canadian Health Food Association (CHFA) and the Health Protection<BR>
&gt;Branch<BR>
&gt;(HPB or Hocus Pocus Bunch). Do not for one second believe these people. Let<BR>
&gt;me explain:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;No, Codex is not a new sanitary napkin. Nor is it a benign group of<BR>
&gt;boring bureaucrats. It is officially known as the United Nations/World Health<BR>
&gt;Organization (WHO) Codex Alimentarius (Nutrition Code) Commission. It meets<BR>
&gt;every 2 years, usually in Rome, and very little has appeared about it in<BR>
&gt;the media. Nevertheless, documentation supports the possibility that Codex<BR>
&gt;is the greatest threat to health freedom in the world today. Most of the<BR>
&gt;information we have on this secretive group can be found on the<BR>
&gt;Internet. Codex is empowered by governments to set standards of<BR>
&gt;operation for the health industry. Over 90% of the international<BR>
&gt;organizations allowed to send delegates to the meetings represent giant<BR>
&gt;multinational pharmaceutical corporations. The only consumer organization<BR>
&gt;is the International Organization of Consumer Unions. Neither the natural<BR>
&gt;health<BR>
&gt;care industry nor the general public has any representation at Codex<BR>
&gt;meetings.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;In October, 1996, Codex met in Bonn, Germany to make radical changes in<BR>
&gt;the rules governing dietary supplements for member nations. The proposals<BR>
&gt;of greatest concern were those made by the German delegation (Proposed<BR>
&gt;Draft Guidelines for Dietary Supplements) and is being sponsored by<BR>
&gt;Hoechst, Bayer and BASF. These are the three drug companies formed when the<BR>
&gt;Nurenberg War Trials<BR>
&gt;disbanded IG Farben, manufacturer of the poison gas used in Nazi<BR>
&gt;concentration camps. This is not the first time that the U.N. has been<BR>
&gt;linked closely with Nazi war criminals. Ostensibly, their purpose is<BR>
&gt;&quot;....create a set of international standards to guide the world's growing<BR>
&gt;food industry and to protect the health of consumers.&quot;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;If you really believe that, I have some ocean front property for you at<BR>
&gt;half price in Saskatoon.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The drug company backed proposals call for the following:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;No vitamin, mineral, herb, etc., can be sold for prophylactic<BR>
&gt;(preventative) or therapeutic reasons.<BR>
&gt;Natural remedies can be sold as food but they must not exceed the<BR>
&gt;potency (dosage) levels set by the commission. This means that consumer<BR>
&gt;access to dietary supplements will be limited to the RDA dosage as a<BR>
&gt;maximum limit for vitamins (vitamin C - 60 mg, vitamin E - 15 mg, etc.).<BR>
&gt;Supplements without an RDA (e.g. coenzyme Q10) would be illegal to sell<BR>
&gt;because they would all become drugs.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Codex regulations for dietary supplements would become binding,<BR>
&gt;eliminating the escape clause within the General Agreement of Tariffs<BR>
&gt;and Trade (GATT) that allows a nation to set its own standards. This<BR>
&gt;applies to all member countries of the U.N. Any nation that does not accept<BR>
&gt;and apply these new standards will be heavily fined by the World Trade<BR>
&gt;Organization (WTO) creating the potential of crippling entire sectors of<BR>
&gt;that nation's economy.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;All new supplements would be banned unless they go through the Codex<BR>
&gt;approval process. Five steps have already been taken in the Codex process<BR>
&gt;over the past few years. Remember Canadian Bill C-7 which was passed<BR>
&gt;eventually in Canada as C-8? The similarity of the process, the secrecy and<BR>
&gt;the wording between the Codex proposals and the Canadian laws is uncanny.<BR>
&gt;Voting in favour of adopting the German proposal has been overwhelming (16<BR>
&gt;for and 2 against<BR>
&gt;in the most recent vote). The Codex process is now at Step Five-<BR>
&gt;formalization and debate concerning the specific features. In two years,<BR>
&gt;Codex could jump from step 5 to step 8 to finalize these restrictions.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The Codex proposals already exist as law in Norway and Germany where the<BR>
&gt;entire health food industry has literally been taken over by the drug<BR>
&gt;companies. In these countries, vitamin C above 200 mg is illegal as is<BR>
&gt;vitamin E above 45 IU, Vitamin B1 over 2.4 mg and so on. Shering-Plough,<BR>
&gt;the Norway pharmaceutical giant, now controls an echinacea tincture which<BR>
&gt;is being sold there as an OTC drug at grossly inflated prices. The same is<BR>
&gt;true of ginkgo and many other herbs and only one government controlled<BR>
&gt;pharmacy has the right to import supplements as medicines which they can<BR>
&gt;sell to health food stores, convenience stores, or pharmacies.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;According to Dr.Matthias Rath, researcher and author who discovered a<BR>
&gt;correlation between vitamin C deficiency and heart disease, the three<BR>
&gt;Nazi-linked drug companies pushing so hard for the German proposal,<BR>
&gt;Hoechst, Bayer and BASF, are also manufacturers of heart drugs. Obviously,<BR>
&gt;with the vitamin competition gone, nothing will stop their profits.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Yes, very much so. According to John C. Hammell, legal advocate for the<BR>
&gt;U.S. based Life Extension Foundation, the Nazi-linked proposals have the<BR>
&gt;backing of Canadian and French Codex commission representatives. In June of<BR>
&gt;1996, the Codex Executive committee will be creating an expert panel on<BR>
&gt;herbs which is likely to generate a negative list to prevent public access<BR>
&gt;to certain herbs internationally (see the list below). The formation of<BR>
&gt;this expert panel was advocated by none other than the Canadian<BR>
&gt;representatives. Why then are the HPB and the CHFA denying that the Codex<BR>
&gt;proposals will have no impact on the<BR>
&gt;availability of nutritional supplements in Canada? Either spokespersons for<BR>
&gt;these two groups are ignorant about the proposals or they are lying to the<BR>
&gt;public in order to protect drug company profits. After all, several voting<BR>
&gt;members of the CHFA are owned by or are subsidiaries of major drug<BR>
&gt;manufacturers<BR>
&gt;or pharmaceutical chains. Neither group can be trusted to give the public<BR>
&gt;straight answers about the Codex scam. They are in a clear conflict of<BR>
&gt;interest since they stand to gain financially when the supplement prices<BR>
&gt;are boosted out the roof. Further evidence of Canadian involvement is the<BR>
&gt;HPB (Hocus Pocus Bunch) position on what is or is not a food or a drug.<BR>
&gt;This bunch is<BR>
&gt;either cleverly devious about their support of pharmaceutical concerns or<BR>
&gt;just plain dumb. For example, garlic, ginger, licorice and peppermint are<BR>
&gt;considered to be foods when sold as spices. If a grocery store manager<BR>
&gt;makes claims for their therapeutic effects, they then become drugs via a<BR>
&gt;hocus pocus mechanism which remains to be defined. As it now stands in<BR>
&gt;Canada (and this changes on a regular basis given the current mood, blood<BR>
&gt;sugar level or whims of officials at the HPB) the following list of<BR>
&gt;currently available health food store nutritional supplements are<BR>
&gt;considered nebulously to be either a drug,  a drug even in the<BR>
&gt;absence of claims or a new drug with claims<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Aloe vera<BR>
&gt;Astragalus<BR>
&gt;Bilberry<BR>
&gt;Capsicum<BR>
&gt;Cascara sagrada<BR>
&gt;Cat's claw<BR>
&gt;Chamomile<BR>
&gt;Dong Quai<BR>
&gt;Echinacea augustifolia<BR>
&gt;Echinacea purpurea<BR>
&gt;Ephedra (Ma huang)<BR>
&gt;Feverfew<BR>
&gt;Garlic<BR>
&gt;Ginger<BR>
&gt;Ginkgo biloba<BR>
&gt;Ginseng<BR>
&gt;Golden Seal<BR>
&gt;Gotu Kola<BR>
&gt;Hawthorne<BR>
&gt;Kava Kava<BR>
&gt;Licorice<BR>
&gt;Milk Thistle<BR>
&gt;Pau D'arco (Taheebo)<BR>
&gt;Peppermint<BR>
&gt;Psyllium<BR>
&gt;Sarsaparilla<BR>
&gt;Saw palmetto<BR>
&gt;Yohimbe<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;This list is likely to expand over the next two years.<BR>
&gt;If the Codex and the HPB have their way, your favorite supplements<BR>
&gt;will be replaced by expensive, patented, over-the-counter or prescription<BR>
&gt;drugs.<BR>
&gt;Just look what has already happened to amino acids like tryptophan. Once<BR>
&gt;available for under $20 for a bottle of 100 tablets of 500 mgs. at your<BR>
&gt;local health food store, the same tablet is now only available by<BR>
&gt;prescription at a cost of over $120 at your pharmacy. On top of that, in<BR>
&gt;order to get a prescription for tryptophan, you will have to convince your<BR>
&gt;doctor to give you one. This is easier said than done simply because most<BR>
&gt;medical doctors have no clue what tryptophan does or believe it to be<BR>
&gt;toxic. Project this shallow<BR>
&gt;thinking on to the herbs listed above and it becomes quite clear that<BR>
&gt;public access to natural remedies will be a thing of the past.&quot;<BR>

Dear Steve and Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I agree with Rachel...some kid you've got there.  And tears came to my<BR>
eyes as I deleted your message, then came Rachel's and her remarks re<BR>
encouraging him to keep writing I thought very valid...I write in a journal<BR>
every morning and have done for about 2 mos. or more and I find that all<BR>
kinds of emotional stuff is emerging re my intestinal disorder and<BR>
connected to it!  Very intersting stuff coming up and I feel cleansed each<BR>
day as I flush the journal paper down the toilet!  Quite a process and very<BR>
helpful for me.  I am healing on many different levels and for me, this is<BR>
necessary.<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Dear Steve,<BR>
&gt;I'm trying to type this with this giant lump lodged in my throat. Quite<BR>
&gt;some kid you've got there. I would encourage him to continue writing. First<BR>
&gt;of all he's obviously got a knack for expression, but most importantly<BR>
&gt;writing can be an invaluable tool for him to cope with his &quot;evil&quot;. Thanks<BR>
&gt;for sharing it.<BR>
