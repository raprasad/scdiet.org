If you have Type O blood as I do, the Gottschall diet with few exceptions<BR>
works just fine. Type A blood will have difficulty with all dairy products. <BR>
Type B will have problems with chicken and beef. Chicken contains a Blood <BR>
Type B agglutinating lectin in thier muscle tissue. Shellfish like crab, lobster,<BR>
shrimp, mussels contain lectins that are disruptive to the Type B system<BR>

This information was obtained from the book &quot;Eat Right 4 Your Type&quot;  (Blood<BR>
Type) by Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo This book should complement the SCD diet.<BR>
My web site may give you additional information:<BR>

After nearly six months as a Type A on the blood type diet, I can say<BR>
that it isn't that Type A blood has trouble with all dairy products. <BR>
They have a problem with the fat in the milk.  Dr. D'Adamo recommends<BR>
non-fat dairy products for Type A's.  I'm finding that non-fat homemade<BR>
yogurt from the diet feels much better to me than even regular non-fat<BR>
yogurt.  For more information:  <A HREF="http://www.dadamo.com">http://www.dadamo.com</A><BR>

One woman recently posted her list of what could be eaten and what could<BR>
not, based on things read in books and what people have said.  After 10<BR>
years of my husband and I fighting for our lives and trying many diets,<BR>
I've found that there is a book somewhere that says almost every food<BR>
has something wrong with it.  I think it's best to just try them<BR>
yourselves.  If someone is having trouble with different foods, of<BR>
course, look into the blood types.  I'm bowing to Elaine's superior<BR>
wisdom here and trying foods that Type A's aren't supposed to have and<BR>
my husband is eating non-Type O foods.  So far, so good.<BR>
