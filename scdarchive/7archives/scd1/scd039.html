Dear HLachs@aol.com,

<P>(I didn't get your name).

<P>I had the same problem you do. I was usually constipated and sometimes felt
as if I had a basketball in my gut, I was that bloated! Off and on this
would reverse to D, which many times I welcomed as it gave me relief. Just
before going on the SCD, Sept. 27, 1997, I also began bleeding. Another
problem was extreme chest pain along with sharp pains around my heart,
which fortunately ended up to be from my stomach, not my heart. My theory
on that was that all the stuff sitting in my intestines, due to
constipation, was causing gas to back up into my stomach.

<P>The SCD has helped me become 'regular', which equates to one good bm in the
morning. I leave the house for work feeling light and good.  I very rarely
experience the chest pain or sharp stomach pains now.

<P>I still have to work at it though, because there are certain foods that are
allowed on the SCD that give me an adverse reaction.  If I have a bad day,
I can usually track it back to a particular food, usually some type of
fruit.

<P>I have also cheated on occasion and I can declare without a doubt that
grains will bring back the constipation immediately and can last for 4-5
days. So breads, pasta, anything with flour in it is harmful.


<P>My doctor wanted me to also try a diet that would be right for my blood
type. I have not completely implemented it because combined with the SCD,
it restricts me even further.  One thing that the blood type diet would
allow is corn, which the SCD does not. So my doctor said to experiment, one
food at a time if I want.  Well, I tried corn (I love chips and salsa). I
do not recall having an immediate gut reaction, i.e. constipation, but it
did bring back my eczema, which some research has shown, the scaly
condition of the skin is an outward sign of what is occurring in the
intestines.

<P>I can summarize all of this by saying, I have tried the SCD, and I have
tested it with somewhat controlled experiments, and my conclusion is, it
works!  And it doesn't pay to cheat.  When I started the SCD I hoped it
would be a temporary thing, maybe 2 or 3 years.  But I have adopted the
attitude that the SCD is the way for me to eat. Since it has made such a
difference in my life, I don't look at it as temporary anymore, and I also
don't see it as restrictive.

<P>I have read that when you continue to eat foods that you are allergic to
you will gain weight. I had gained an unwanted 25 lbs. I would also notice,
when I was experiencing bloating, I could gain 5 lbs in one day! I have
lost that 25 lbs and am back to my  ideal body weight. The daily weight
fluctuations have diminished as well.

<P>Sorry for making this so long. I hope you try the SCD, and I hope you get
the same relief that I have. You will want to be fanatic about it,
especially for the first 4 weeks, to see if it is going to help you.

<P>Regards,<BR>
Linda
