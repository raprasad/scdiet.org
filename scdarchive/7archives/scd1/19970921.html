RE:     Dextrose, yogurt<BR>
<BR>
Dear Compatriots:  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        I've wondered about &quot;dextrose&quot; as well.  It seems it should be<BR>
allowed (though I think it's clear &quot;maltodextrose&quot; is not).  And, what is=<BR>
<BR>
&quot;nutritive dextrose&quot;? That's the main ingredient in Sweet 'N Low.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        I've been on the diet 7 months (almost religiously).  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        I did not try the yogurt at first because I like my food as sweet=<BR>
<BR>
as possible, and yogurt is so tart.  But then I read on the list about<BR>
using half and half.  I miss milk so much (I used to drink about a quart =<BR>
of<BR>
whole milk or half and half a day).  So, if I've given up chocolate and<BR>
bread and rice and potatoes, it would be nice to at least get something<BR>
creamy back.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        I ordered the Donvier yogurt maker (without the timer) from<BR>
Williams Sonoma.  I have since ordered the extra jars -- be aware the<BR>
extras are plastic and the ones that come with the maker are glass.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        I ordered starter from Yogourmet.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Using half and half, I now make a quart every two days.  It is<BR>
wonderful.  I put honey in mine and stir thoroughly.  Sometimes I then pu=<BR>
t<BR>
it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  No need for an ice cream maker.  Last<BR>
weekend, I added frozen strawberries and honey with yogurt in the blender=<BR>
<BR>
(I think the food processor would be better).  I froze the resulting<BR>
mixture and created sherbert -- fabulous.  I've also added apples baked a=<BR>
s<BR>
described in the book -- incredible.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        For me, the diet made a small difference fairly quickly.  However=<BR>
,<BR>
I only just began to feel like it might be possible to become well in the=<BR>
<BR>
last month.  And, I still have symptoms and take asacol.  I had to go bac=<BR>
k<BR>
on 15 mg. of prednisone 3 weeks ago.  But, I am finally regaining some<BR>
energy and the arthritis has almost completely subsided.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        The most important thing I have learned is that if I am<BR>
unacceptably stressed, it does not matter what I am doing for the CD and<BR>
UC.  Feeling out of control and having pent up anger take over everything=<BR>
=2E =<BR>
<BR>
It is clear to me that learning to deal with anger  and control without<BR>
internalizing my emotions is the key to all of this.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        The second most important thing I have learned is that I was<BR>
keeping myself going on the sugar and caffeine in chocolate (there was a<BR>
reason I had chocolate stashed in every room of my life).  The chocolate<BR>
cravings have only just begun to ease.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        I have lost 13 pounds of sugar fat, my grossly bloated belly has<BR>
begun to disappear (thankfully,  no one congratulates me on my pregnancy<BR>
anymore).   =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        For comparative purposes, I am 44, have had both CD and UC since<BR>
1985, managed to function with Asacol until last December.  By May I was =<BR>
so<BR>
sick and debilitated (though the bleeding had stopped -- prednisone) I<BR>
thought I was going to become an invalid.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        As a result I transferred my law practice to my associate and am =<BR>
in<BR>
the process of retiring.  I've gone to work for our court system -- one<BR>
full time job instead of 3.  I attribute my most recent set back to the<BR>
pent up stress of wrapping everything up -- but I know I am on the right<BR>
road to becoming healthy.  I feel stronger and more focused despite the<BR>
lingering pains and discomforts than I have in more than a few years.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        It took me years and I'm sure many influences to become this<BR>
debilitated, so it will probably take a while to grow strong.  But, I wan=<BR>
t<BR>
to be around for a long time and I have an awful lot of things I want to =<BR>
do<BR>
with my life.  So, even if the diet isn't a miracle for some, I recommend=<BR>
<BR>
remaining committed if you believe it is helping at all.  I think this is=<BR>
 a<BR>
process that has to take place on many levels.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        BTW, the bad taste in my mouth of which I last complained is, I<BR>
think, prednisone (evil stuff, but sometimes the only temporary fix).  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        There are a thousand more details, but there are many of us who<BR>
have lots to say.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        I think the yogurt has taken everything a step forward for me.  S=<BR>
o,<BR>
I will delight in it for as long as that seems to be true.  =<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Best wishes to all.  =<BR>

How do I know if the diet is working.  I've been on it for a week now: but<BR>
not sure?  I started the diet when I was in good shape though.  <BR>
<BR>
I've had CD since '88. Been on the sulfa drugs and the pred.., but last year<BR>
I had my first MAJOR resection. I've been great since. Some minor cramping<BR>
and minor tenderness occasionally, but NOTHING like before.  I started the<BR>
diet as a precautionary tactic. I still have the cramping and tenderness, so<BR>
I'm not sure.<BR>
<BR>
What it really comes down to is: &quot;am I causing myself extra hassle by<BR>
adhering to the diet, or should I just do what my doctor says (which is- if<BR>
it bothers you don't eat it, and if it doesn't eat it.)  Because I love<BR>
pasta... LOVE IT!! And now I can't have it. AND I DON'T LIKE NOT HAVING IT!<BR>
 I love sugar to, but I accept that it causes me problems I was trying to<BR>
avoid that anyway. (which means I cut down my intake -not gave it up<BR>
completely)  I love bread to ... Bagels, sandwiches etc... <BR>
<BR>
I think I'm at a crossroad. Do I make the sacrifice and stay on the diet, or<BR>
do I eat the way I enjoy eating??  <BR>
<BR>
any thoughts??<BR>

Dear Mike,<BR>
I totally understand your predicament. The diet is a hassle, no doubt about<BR>
it especially at the beggining, before it becomes a part of your daily<BR>
rituals. I wasn't in &quot;great&quot; shape when I started but I wasn't in the worse<BR>
shape I'd ever been in either. I started feeling the effects of the diet<BR>
immediately. My bleeding subsided, then stopped. Same for the pain and<BR>
urgency. How, if you're in great shape, can you tell if you are benefitting<BR>
from the diet? Well, if you stay on it, you may never know. You may also<BR>
never have to have another symptom or resection. I think that statiscally<BR>
speaking, most people whose symptoms have led to surgery, eventually need<BR>
another. I could be wrong, but most of the people I've been in touch with<BR>
lead me to beleive that in most cases, if the causes of the disease (such<BR>
as eating habits) aren't changed, there's not much hope in avoiding<BR>
reccurance of the disease. In your case, maybe you'll never have another<BR>
bout, no matter what you do. Who knows? I know that giving up grains and<BR>
sugars is a major sacrifice, but you can become accustomed to it, if you<BR>
beleive it can keep you healthy. Are you still on meds? I've been off meds<BR>
for about a year and 1/2 (on the diet 2 &amp; 1/2) and the diet itself is<BR>
enough to keep me symptom free. I don't know if my letter helps in your<BR>
dilema. I can only tell you that the diet has been a life saver for me.<BR>
Good luck in whatever you decide.<BR>

In a message dated 97-09-21 12:56:08 EDT, you write:<BR>

&lt;&lt; I think I'm at a crossroad. Do I make the sacrifice and stay on the diet,<BR>
or<BR>
 do I eat the way I enjoy eating??  <BR>
  &gt;&gt;<BR>
<BR>
You might find that, given a little more time, you enjoy the diet more.  I<BR>
know most of my cravings pretty much faded and that surprised me (I was just<BR>
sure I'd be dying for a coke by now, but I find that I genuinely prefer apple<BR>
juice at this point!)  I've been on the diet for about 3 weeks.  <BR>
<BR>
In my case it's made a big difference in how I feel so I'm highly motivated<BR>
to continue.  But I can see how if it doesn't seem to make that much<BR>
difference, you'd question whether it's worth it.<BR>
<BR>
One idea would be to get an ELISA test for food sensitivities.  You can be<BR>
sensitive to foods without realizing it.  A compromise diet for you at this<BR>
point might be to religiously avoid those foods you test as sensitive to.<BR>
 The test might give you the concrete motivation to avoid those foods, and<BR>
avoiding them might help to prolong your remission.<BR>

Mike  <BR>
<BR>
I am one of those people who subcribes to the list, but does follow the diet <BR>
strictly.  I have   However, I think it would be worthwhile to stay on the <BR>
diet until the cravings for pasta and bread subside.  This, much to my <BR>
surprise, did happen about 3 weeks into during the period when I followed it <BR>
religiously..   <BR>
<BR>
My doctor then recommended that I add other foods.  I was losing too much <BR>
weight--she had never weighed me on a scale, this was just her <BR>
observation--and I felt like I never had enough energy for full-time work and <BR>
school at night.  I started with just slow-cooking oatmeal.   I allow myself <BR>
brown rice from time to time--I'm not sure yet sure if it's OK for me.  Wheat <BR>
remains a problem.<BR>
<BR>
I think the most important thing that happened while I was on the diet was <BR>
losing my insatiable cravings for wheat and other starches.   I now eat <BR>
considerably less grain or starch based food and feel much better.  I don't <BR>
feel like I need it at every meal any more.   I seem to have a threshold for <BR>
carbohydrates in general.  A little here and there doesn't bother me, but <BR>
something like the 11 servings a day in the USDA food pyramid is way too much. <BR>
  <BR>
<BR>
One book called Natural Healing by Jack Soltanoff,  has a couple of different <BR>
diets based on natural foods.  He feels that wheat and other gluten-containing <BR>
foods should be avoided, but allows 2 eat-whatever-you-want days on the less <BR>
spartan diet.<BR>
<BR>
My condition, so the doctor tells me, is not that severe, so I can probably <BR>
afford to do more experimentation than others on this list.   However, it's <BR>
hard to really identify your own sensitivities unless you spend a few weeks on <BR>
a diet like the SCD.  <BR>
<BR>
Good luck.<BR>

The local Safeway here in Oregon carries Dry Curd Cottage Cheese. It is Lucerne brand and <BR>
comes in a plastic bag. Recently happened across it while looking for cheese. <BR>
<BR>
Since Lucerne is a Safeway brand, I'd expect that any Safeway store should be able to get it.<BR>

I will give you one quick thought.  <BR>
You said &quot;Some minor cramping<BR>
and minor tenderness occasionally, but NOTHING like before.  I started the<BR>
diet as a precautionary tactic. I still have the cramping and tenderness,<BR>
so<BR>
I'm not sure&quot;.  <BR>
Sounds to me you should give the diet a chance about a month or so.  <BR>
See if the cramps and the tenderness goes away.  <BR>
Are you on the diet 110%?  <BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>

Dear Lucy &amp; all,<BR>
I just took your advice about baking. My complaint was that in order to get<BR>
my baked goods cooked inside, the outside would get burnt. You said &quot;bake<BR>
longer at a lower temp&quot;. Duuhh!!! I just made bananna cake with crushed<BR>
pecans. I swear I don't remember bakery stuff tasting this good. If anyone<BR>
wants to try something different and you like beans and saurkraut, try this<BR>
variation on my Hungarian Mom's sour cream soup (yogurt instead of sour<BR>
cream). I use 2 lbs of beans cause I really love them. Best at room<BR>
temperature.<BR>
1 lb. of navy beans<BR>
4 cups of yogurt (I use half &amp; half)<BR>
1 egg yolk<BR>
1 lb of saurkraut<BR>
1 tblspoon salt<BR>
<BR>
soak beans as usual, then cook an hour (4 inches of water above the beans)<BR>
then add salt, cook another hour (or until beans are pretty soft, but still<BR>
firm ) then add saurkraut, cook another 20 min.<BR>
In a large glass (corningware worked well for me) dish, slowly add the egg<BR>
yolk to the yogurt (kind of like how you add the starter). Then slowly add<BR>
the hot water from the beans into the yogurt, a ladelfull at a time,<BR>
stirring well, When this mixture becomes warm (feel the bottom of the<BR>
dish), it is safe to add the yogurt mixture back into the beans. Bring to<BR>
slow simmer, then shut off and it is done. Served room temperature or cold.<BR>

Mike, <BR>
<BR>
I think that you should at least give this diet a chance. I too love all<BR>
kinds of &quot;forbidden foods&quot;. I am 27 years old and have had UC for 15 years.<BR>
 I was on all kinds of medications like azulfidine and Asacol, not to mention<BR>
prednisone.  Ask yourself one question--do you want to keep going to doctors<BR>
and the hospital for the rest of your life?  In other words, what keeps me<BR>
going is believing that If I keep with this diet, I wont have to listen to<BR>
all the pessimistic doctors who dont know anything.  <BR>
     To give you some encouragement, I have been on the diet for almost nine<BR>
months. It is very very difficult at first.  Just give it some time and some<BR>
amazing things will happen.  <BR>
<BR>
Good Luck,<BR>

Hello,<BR>
I have recently discovered SCD and am cautiously hopeful and excited<BR>
that it will help me with my lifelong IBD.  I began the diet three days<BR>
ago (the strict one), and some of my symptoms are better, some not.  <BR>
My big question--I am allergic to dairy.  I have been using goat's milk<BR>
yoghurt, and been unable to locate dry curd cottage cheese.  One of the<BR>
symptoms I am having is excema, which usually occurs when I eat dairy.<BR>
Advice?  Help?<BR>

Hullo,<BR>
	A recent posting by Mike is indicative of the inertia of <BR>
life-style patterns even in the face of serious disease. It's difficult <BR>
to accept that something as basic and pleasureable as eating sweets is to <BR>
be eschewed, but a chronic disease necessitates a complete shift in one's <BR>
thinking and function in life. The loss of life-style associated with <BR>
avoiding a very large class of carbohydrates though, is trivial compared to <BR>
the losses incurred from suffering many other diseases (eg., MS).<BR>
	We need to be conscious that there is no cure for CD or UC, and <BR>
that (though the point may be open to debate) possibly the most likely <BR>
factor in shortening the lifespan of sufferers is surgery relatively <BR>
early in life. In the absence of definite knowledge about the <BR>
pathogenesis of the disease the value of surgery as a long term solution <BR>
will be open to question. <BR>
	Since there is no cure, sufferers should incorporate into their <BR>
thinking the fact that in any foreseeable future they will continue to <BR>
have the disease to contend with. It should be realized that a concession <BR>
made in the area of eating habits may well buy for a sufferer the <BR>
opportunity to function normally in every other capacity, possibly for an <BR>
undiminished span of life.<BR>
	As far as I'm aware there are three strategies for self- <BR>
management of IBD's, restriction diets (eg., SCD), probiotics (the <BR>
cultivation of 'beneficial' bowel flora through diet or infusion), and <BR>
prebiotics (the ingestion of carbohydrates which are fermented in the <BR>
colon to produce short chain fatty acids which are purported to have <BR>
beneficial effects on the colon wall).<BR>
	Something that sufferers should be aware of is that medical <BR>
treatment is based on a short-term model. When a doctor tells you that <BR>
you must take a medication for the foreseeable future, that is not a <BR>
long-term strategy, that is a short-term solution extended to an infinite <BR>
time horizon.<BR>
	Sufferers of IBD are fortunate in that the disease can often be <BR>
managed with life-style changes and monitoring. But first the sufferer <BR>
has to accept some hard realities about their condition. Then they can <BR>
obtain information about the possibilities open to them and hopefully <BR>
negotiate with their specialist a long-term management plan for the <BR>
disease, rather than simply accepting 'reactive medicine' (essentially, <BR>
waiting for the disease to do something, and treat that).<BR>
None of this is easy. That's why they call it dis(s)-ease.<BR>

Hey! I object!  Doctors, especially those treating UC and Chrons<BR>
patients, particularly those who look at you sideways or suddenly lose<BR>
their hearing when you try to describe the benefits that avoiding<BR>
complex carbohydrates has brought you, they know plenty!  Particularly<BR>
that they have huge mortgages and Mercedes car payments as well as high<BR>
insurance costs.  If suddenly all their patients were eating themselves<BR>
healthy, well, I better shut up before the AMA has Elaine's book<BR>
&quot;removed&quot; from print...<BR>
<BR>
&gt; To give you some encouragement, I have been on the diet for almost<BR>
&gt; nine<BR>
&gt; months. It is very very difficult at first.  Just give it some time<BR>
&gt; and some<BR>
&gt; amazing things will happen.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the diet for over a year and a half, and I can say, at 37<BR>
years old, that I've never felt better!  I've started cheating, just to<BR>
see if anything happens (had 6 beers the other night, only got a<BR>
hangover!) I am staying on the diet for the rest of my life, but only<BR>
religiously for the next 6 months).<BR>

Mike, Sometimes such a strong craving to a food and resistance to doing<BR>
without it can indicate an intolerance for that food.  Try to get past the<BR>
first few weeks of strong cravings, then &quot;challenge&quot; yourself by eating<BR>
just a little of it and see if you have a reaction (usually within the<BR>
first few hours, sometimes as much as 24 hours).  I know that I felt the<BR>
same way about milk.<BR>

Good luck, Kim<BR>

&gt; How do I know if the diet is working.  I've been on it for a week now: but<BR>
&gt; not sure?  I started the diet when I was in good shape though.  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I've had CD since '88. Been on the sulfa drugs and the pred.., but last<BR>
year<BR>
&gt; I had my first MAJOR resection. I've been great since. Some minor cramping<BR>
&gt; and minor tenderness occasionally, but NOTHING like before.  I started the<BR>
&gt; diet as a precautionary tactic. I still have the cramping and tenderness,<BR>
so<BR>
&gt; I'm not sure.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; What it really comes down to is: &quot;am I causing myself extra hassle by<BR>
&gt; adhering to the diet, or should I just do what my doctor says (which is-<BR>
if<BR>
&gt; it bothers you don't eat it, and if it doesn't eat it.)  Because I love<BR>
&gt; pasta... LOVE IT!! And now I can't have it. AND I DON'T LIKE NOT HAVING<BR>
IT!<BR>
&gt;  I love sugar to, but I accept that it causes me problems I was trying to<BR>
&gt; avoid that anyway. (which means I cut down my intake -not gave it up<BR>
&gt; completely)  I love bread to ... Bagels, sandwiches etc... <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think I'm at a crossroad. Do I make the sacrifice and stay on the diet,<BR>
or<BR>
&gt; do I eat the way I enjoy eating??  <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; any thoughts??<BR>

hi <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
my son takes 12 asacol a day, and he has headaches, usually about<BR>
4 hours after taking the dose.  the doctor told him to reduce the<BR>
dose , due to the headaches and since his D had stopped.<BR>
<BR>
will the headaches go away with time? ( he has been taking 12 a day<BR>
for about 45 days, he has had headaches ever since.)<BR>
<BR>
just in case anyone wants to know, i talked to University of Texas<BR>
disability services and they are going to be a big help, russell<BR>
can get support and understanding from this group while going to<BR>
college. The UC will probably ensure his admission, they register you<BR>
as student with a disability, you get letters sent to your professor<BR>
and they work with the professors so that they allow<BR>
for your illness if needed. the lady i talked to on the phone <BR>
actually has IBD herself and was really supportive, she referred<BR>
me to her doctor who has a nutritional approach to the disease, i<BR>
wonder if it's the SCD. <BR>
<BR>
Has anyone been successfull in getting a college to serve a student <BR>
with IBD disability the SCD diet ?<BR>
<BR>
i am getting the ball rolling with my company on extending russell's<BR>
medical coverage beyond the age of 19, regardless of his status as<BR>
a full time student, hopefully this will go OK, has anyone else<BR>
had any experience with this?<BR>

All I can say is that you be very very sure that you dot the t's and<BR>
cross the i's.  I lost my insurance 1 year into the disease.  When I was<BR>
finished with my undergrad degree (and on my parents policy) I switched<BR>
to the university insurance which cost me about $30 a semester.  I<BR>
wasn't sick at the time.  Then I got sick, and when I left school, there<BR>
was no way to keep the insurance and I was self employed, so I couldn't<BR>
get any insurance at all.<BR>
<BR>
In retrospect, once I started paying for my health care, I started<BR>
getting my money's worth.  I'm not sure if I would be as healthy as I am<BR>
today if it wasn't for losing my insurance.  I'm sure we all know people<BR>
who will say: &quot;But my insurance doesn't cover it, I _can't_ do that.&quot;<BR>
(yes you can, yes you can, wake up!).  I really think we'd all be a lot<BR>
more healthy if we just paid for our own day to day care -- leave the<BR>
big operations to the insurance.  We'd probably be much richer in terms<BR>
of the lowered costs - not only in premiums but in doctor's bills.<BR>

Hi J.P.,<BR>
<BR>
I'm also on the dreaded pred. down to 10mg. a day and crossing my <BR>
fingers!  I'm also taking NOVO -5 ASA ( a generic Asacol with no lactose) <BR>
which is helping me wean off the pred.. I've been on the diet 5 months <BR>
and certainly feel better for it - less bloating and gas, and I eat like <BR>
mad without weight gain. My doctor, although a tad sceptical, is <BR>
supportive as long as I eat a balanced diet and really wants me off the <BR>
pred. as soon as possible but using the NOVO (Asacol) as a maintenance <BR>
drug as long as necessary. I do stick to the diet religously (except for <BR>
a little too much Scotch at times), and quite enjoy it and really hope it <BR>
is the ticket to getting off and staying off the steroids.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck,<BR>

Hi listies,<BR>
<BR>
Working in the &quot;chemical dependency&quot; field, you learn that one of the<BR>
symptoms of drug withdrawal (actually, it's a symptom of &quot;post-acute<BR>
withdrawal&quot;) is drug dreams: the person dreams of getting high, of getting<BR>
the drugs, of being chased by cops because of drugs, or whatever to do with<BR>
drugs.  Well, I've been having carbohydrate dreams (after about 6 weeks on<BR>
the diet)! <BR>
<BR>
Has anyone else experienced these?<BR>
<BR>
An example:  I'm in a bagel restaurant, where they serve bagels with<BR>
assorted toppings, cream cheese, butter, the usual, but up to and including<BR>
bagels with french-fries (that's the one I pick).<BR>
<BR>
I'm not really having much problem with actual cravings -- just now and<BR>
then when I see a particularly good-smelling bagel or whatever.  Just the<BR>
dreams.<BR>

I'm not a physician, but, speaking from experience:<BR>
<BR>
   Sounds like you're definitely on the prednisone wavelength!  I am at<BR>
the final stage of pred, which I started taking after an annoying and<BR>
unexpected flare (I've been on the diet over a year). Having been on the<BR>
diet for so long, I believe, along with the pred, my flare went away<BR>
very quickly, and this was with 20mg max per day.  Now I'm taking 5mg.<BR>
every other day, which is practically nothing, except that towards the<BR>
end of the second day, I get tired, which I attribute to prednisone<BR>
withdrawal.  I have noticed my stools loosening a bit, but I attribute<BR>
this to my ability (and practice)of eating raw veggies, lots of apples,<BR>
and nut flour. I am going to alter my diet a bit, going more towards<BR>
cooked squashes, hamburgers, etc, until I'm more normal.  But I have no<BR>
&quot;urgency&quot; or bleeding which were prevalent prior to and during the first<BR>
6 months of the diet. (actually I was bleeding a tiny bit even past the<BR>
first year).<BR>
<BR>
I think you need to stay on meds a while longer, sticking religiously to<BR>
the diet as I had (everyone's different, mind you), and just wait it<BR>
out.  In a year, if you have a flare, it will require less medical<BR>
treatment, this has been my experience.<BR>

Dear Jim,.<BR>
I would be interested in knowing more about prebiotics, because I was under<BR>
the impression that fermenting carbohydrates in the colon actually was a<BR>
major cause of  trouble for people with IBD.<BR>
Could you please elaborate.<BR>

Hi Bill,<BR>
<BR>
.... &quot;(And I got off the drugs in 4 months!)&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I agree with you about Chiropractors who specialize in other areas.  I used<BR>
to see one in Toronto who was also a Naturopath.  He believed strongly in the<BR>
yeast connection.  I followed his diet (from 30+ years experience) which<BR>
was mainly avoid all dairy and sugar.  Similar to SCD except that I ate<BR>
pasta, potatoes, rice.  He would not let me have ANY fruit for at least<BR>
a year.  I noticed big changes the first week by removing all sugar and<BR>
drinking lots of 'clean' water.  I was off all prescription drugs within<BR>
6 months (prednisone, Flagyl).  I regained weight as my energy increased<BR>
and I started to exercise more.  I did this for over two years religiously.<BR>
And then I strayed from the diet, eventually needing my second surgery<BR>
a couple of years.  I paid the price for not staying with what worked.<BR>
<BR>
I now follow the SCD diet religiously.  I hope others will learn from my<BR>
experiences (and mistakes).<BR>
 <BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi Stewart (from UK),<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; It's been hard to stick to the diet when you've got two young kids and<BR>
    a pregnant wife, ... &gt;&gt;<BR>
 <BR>
I've been dying to respond to this one for a while.  I could not before<BR>
because my wife and I were not telling anyone yet.  We (yes we) are pregnant<BR>
with our second child :)  (three months).<BR>
<BR>
I can very much relate to how much work it is taking care of a pregnant wife,<BR>
an 18-month old, cleaning the kitchen/house, finances, getting a garage built<BR>
right now, *and* cooking/preparing the SCD related foods.  This pregnancy<BR>
is hard on my wife because she has a lot of nausea, and morning sickness ALL day.<BR>
This of course creates a lot more work for me, on top of my full-time job at<BR>
the university.  It sure sucks out all the remaining energy that I have.  It's <BR>
a good thing that the SCD (after three months) has given me more energy.  I have<BR>
now started doing pushups again.<BR>
<BR>
So, overall, &quot;every day in every way, I am getting better and better&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

&gt;Mike and Steve,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, and maybe in southern California as well,<BR>
&gt;dry curd cottage cheese is more often called baker's cheese. Also, several<BR>
&gt;weeks ago there was a post that gave the name of a store in San Francisco<BR>
&gt;that was willing to ship DCCC to customers.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Tom<BR>
<BR>
Hi,<BR>
That post was mine, and the store (in S.F.) is :<BR>
<BR>
Country Cheese Co.<BR>
415 Divisadero St.<BR>
San Francisco, CA 94117<BR>
(415)621-8130<BR>
<BR>
The owner's name is Mario Mariscal, and his price is very reasonable too. I<BR>
pay $2.00 per lb. that's before shipping of course. Mario told me that he<BR>
ships it frozen to people. Also try any bakery that sells cheese dainishes.<BR>
find out where they get their cheese.<BR>

Hi group,<BR>
<BR>
It's good to see some new people getting involved on the list, either<BR>
asking questions or giving supportive answers.<BR>
<BR>
To those asking about getting off prednisone, do so as soon as your<BR>
situation allows.  After being on the SCD for a while, your body will<BR>
start healing itself *naturally* and the need for prednisone will go <BR>
away.  I believe that you are better off with Asacol (for UC) or<BR>
Pentasa (for CD like me), since these have much less side-effects.<BR>
<BR>
Prednisone has *serious* side-effects and complications... it is a steroid.<BR>
For those who take, or used to, prednisone I would suggest you ask your<BR>
doctor about getting a bone-density x-ray.  This is very mild radiation<BR>
and a very simple (relaxing) test.  It will help you determine if you<BR>
have any bone loss, which leads to osteoporosis.  I was diagnosed with<BR>
*severe* (like an 80-year old) osteoporosis at age 31 because of prednisone.<BR>
This is not to scare anyone, but it is a fact.  IBD also robs bone density<BR>
because loss of calcium in the bones is a result of protein malabsorption,<BR>
not from lack of calcium intake.  It's the protein that helps to bind the<BR>
calcium to the bones.<BR>
<BR>
Even though I have osteo, I walk and look quite normal.  What it really<BR>
means is that I have five times higher risk of bone fractures.  So<BR>
contact sports (oh darn), and parachuting (oh well) are out of the question.<BR>
It's a good thing already did bungy-jumping (in water) before I was ever<BR>
diagnosed :)<BR>
<BR>
I write this to let those using prednisone be properly informed of the risks. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

<BR>
Another bone related side effect from prednisone is something called<BR>
necro.... can't think of the word, but it has to do with the blood supply<BR>
dying off, especially to the hip joints. I know a 32 year old male dealing<BR>
with this problem, he's now looking at needing hip replacement surgery.<BR>
This is a big problem at his age because the new hip only lasts about 10<BR>
years, and they can only do it I think he told me 3 times. He was only on<BR>
prednisone for a couple of months. <BR>
I have decided not to ever take prednisone again, unless it is absolutely<BR>
necessary to save my life. I would rather lose my colon than lose all you<BR>
can lose on prednisone. I believe it is prescribed much too casually.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
In my search for alternative therapies that might complement the SCD, I <BR>
ran into a German &quot;Institut f&cedil;r Mikrokologie&quot; in Herborn.<BR>
<BR>
They analyze your stool and based on an analysis of the bacteria and <BR>
fungus(?) recommend a therapie consisting of:<BR>
<BR>
1) Various &quot;symbioflor&quot; capsules with bacteria.<BR>
2) Autovaccine<BR>
<BR>
The Autovaccine is based on your own stool and is supposed to work on <BR>
the Mucosa-immunesystem(?).<BR>
<BR>
Now have any of you heard anything good or bad about these guys? Or <BR>
about that type of therapy? It seems very serious, but I can't figure <BR>
out if it really is.<BR>
<BR>

Just a couple extra pointers on the quiche recipe (below) that I sent in a<BR>
couple of weeks ago. I like it best made with whole milk yogurt, the<BR>
tartness adds to the flavor. If you are using the 1/2 and 1/2 yogurt (less<BR>
tart) I would recommend substituting the cheddar cheese for swiss cheese.<BR>
Also, if the bunch of spinach is small, use two. You want enough spinach in<BR>
there so that you can taste it. <BR>

Stewarts in Vermont is cheaper than Country Cheese Co. their prices are:<BR>
<BR>
24 oz = 1.73<BR>
5 lb   = 5.28<BR>

the 5 lb. works out to be $1.06 per pound. shipping might kill us tho<BR>

Hi group,<BR>
<BR>
I thought you might find this interesting...  I looked up in my yellow<BR>
pages under &quot;Nuts - edible&quot; and found a wholesaler of nuts.  I called<BR>
and confirmed that I could purchase a 25 lb box of ground blanched almonds<BR>
for about $125 CDN.  Hughson's price was around $90 US + shipping + duty<BR>
+ exchange rate (nearly 40%).<BR>
<BR>
I picked up my first order yesterday.  On the box it said, go ahead guess,<BR>
Hughson Nut Company fom California.  So I am getting Hughson's product<BR>
from a local distributor :)  Being in Canada, and in my city, this is more<BR>
convenient and basically the same price.<BR>
<BR>
To anyone looking for a source of nuts (mainly for people outside the USA)...<BR>
check your phone book.  The larger cities will more than likely have a<BR>
supplier you can call.  Same goes for DCCC.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Subject: Beer/Betasone<BR>
<BR>
I hope this message gets there!<BR>
<BR>
Having been a craft home brewer of fine beers for about <BR>
years that's what I miss the most after being on this <BR>
diet for about 6 weeks.  The book is pretty vague on this<BR>
matter as well telling us to avoid beer.  Does this mean to<BR>
not drink it at all or that its ok to have one occasionally?<BR>
<BR>
Also my DR. told me about a drug called Betasone which supposedly<BR>
is as effective as prednisone but does not have the same long <BR>
term side effects.  Has anyone else heard of this drug?  I guess<BR>
it's awaiting approval from the FDA here in the U.S. but is being<BR>
used in the European market.<BR>

Elaine suggests keeping away from beer I guess because of hops, barley<BR>
(yeast?) ect. An occasional white wine is fine. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar<BR>
with the drug you mention.<BR>

<BR>
Hi Mike and others,<BR>
<BR>
&gt; .....  I'm going to *try* and stay on the diet for at least the<BR>
&gt; month recommended. Then I might *try* some experimenting. Who knows??<BR>
<BR>
Once think I have learned about getting things done, is to never use<BR>
the negative words 'try', 'can't', should, etc.  These create a negative<BR>
outlook on your expectations.  Mike, instead of 'trying' the diet,<BR>
'do' the diet.  Trying implies a half-hearted attempt at somthing.  We<BR>
are all guilty of this, including myself, however we *can* do it.<BR>
<BR>
Have you ever noticed that I also never use the word 'but', instead I<BR>
use 'however'. Using 'but' in a sentence negates the first part of a<BR>
sentence.  I know these are just semantics, nonetheless it does make<BR>
a difference in the way you look at things, and the message you send.<BR>
<BR>
If you do the diet for at least three months (strict), you will most<BR>
likely see good results as I have (and I was pretty bad).<BR>
<BR>
Just my humble opinion of course.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
In my search for alternative therapies that might complement the SCD, I <BR>
ran into a German &quot;Institut f&cedil;r Mikrokologie&quot; in Herborn.<BR>
<BR>
They analyze your stool and based on an analysis of the bacteria and <BR>
fungus(?) recommend a therapie consisting of:<BR>
<BR>
1) Various &quot;symbioflor&quot; capsules with bacteria.<BR>
2) Autovaccine<BR>
<BR>
The Autovaccine is based on your own stool and is supposed to work on <BR>
the Mucosa-immunesystem(?).<BR>
<BR>
Now have any of you heard anything good or bad about these guys? Or <BR>
about that type of therapy? It seems very serious, but I can't figure <BR>
out if it really is.<BR>
<BR>
- Kurt<BR>

It looks like everyone has all the answers they need for now.  If there<BR>
are no questions or information to give out nobody receives any mail.<BR>
It looks like most of the members that want to cheat have quit cheating<BR>

It probably would be nice if a few of the newer participants would write<BR>
about their pluses or minuses.<BR>

Did you actually ever order nut flour from Hughson, and if you did what <BR>
is the difference in price from the place you order from now?  Do you <BR>
think that the nut wholesaler you have found in Alberta would ship to <BR>
Ontario?  <BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I don't know if you remember my story or not.  I have been on the diet<BR>
for 16 months now.  Things were great until the end of June.  I had even<BR>
taken myself off the Pentasa in April.  Since the end of June I've had 4<BR>
flares which I'm currently still in the fouth.  After every flare I<BR>
figured it would be the last not going back on the Pentasa full time.  I<BR>
was so confident!  This last flare has been pretty bad though.  I went<BR>
back to the good doctor :-) this week and he has upped my Pentasa from<BR>
16 to 20 pills a day.  I expected him to point his finger and tell me I<BR>
told you so about going off the Pentasa.  It wasn't that bad though.  He<BR>
did say that I lasted a little longer than most people do while not<BR>
taking the Pentasa.  So that was encouraging.  He is concerned about my<BR>
weight since it doesn't leave me much margin when things are bad.  My<BR>
blood tests showed inflammation but other that that they were great with<BR>
the exception of being just a little low on Potassium.  My cholesterol<BR>
was great!<BR>
<BR>
I'm now into the second week of diarrhea and hoping it doesn't last much<BR>
longer.  I'm sick of chicken soup but don't want to eat anything that<BR>
will prolong the diarrhea.  I need to try to gain some weight too.  So<BR>
cooked vegetables?  I've noticed before when I've had flares that the<BR>
nut muffins add more bulk to the stool once I'm on my way back to<BR>
health.  Are nut muffins ok to eat while I'm still having diarrhea and<BR>
cramping?  I'm hungry, yet at the same time I'm kind of nauseas.  Kind<BR>
of weird.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm trying to avoid being put back on the Prednisone.  I'm supposed to<BR>
call back the doctor next week and let him know how I'm doing.  If it's<BR>
not any worse I think he will let me remain on the higher dose of<BR>
Pentasa for a little longer to see if it will work.<BR>
<BR>
The doctor said it was worth experimenting coming off the Pentasa, but<BR>
it didn't work, so now stay on it forever.  I probably will for quite a<BR>
while, &gt; 1 year, but who knows...I beleive the body can heal given the<BR>
chance and I think I had a pretty good start at it.  For some reason<BR>
I've taken a few steps backwards, but I still think that given a little<BR>
more time and a chance to heal I can some day get back to getting off<BR>
the medicine.  Maybe, I was just a little premature.<BR>
<BR>
Hoping everyone else is feeling good,<BR>
<BR>

Dear Cheryl,<BR>
Sorry about the setback. Hope you're feeling GREAT soon. As for the nut<BR>
muffins, I'd avoid putting whole or chopped nuts in them for now. Couldn't<BR>
hurt to add a banana or two to the batter. See how you do on them just<BR>
being made with the nut flour and don't eat more than one to start. If all<BR>
seems well 24 hours later, try another. Keep us posted.<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I just wanted to write in to say that at the end of being on the diet<BR>
for 8 months, I am now symptom free.  I also have been able to begin<BR>
eating dairy again, which I wasn't able to for quite awhile.  I have<BR>
followed the diet fanatically.  In August I had an upserge in health<BR>
after doing a 20 day course of an anti-protozoal drug (Yodoxin) after a<BR>
test showed that I was infected with an amoeba (and probably had been<BR>
for the last seven years).  Since doing the drug, the last remaining<BR>
symptoms I had that I was unable to shake, loose stool and lowered<BR>
vitality, went away.  I can't believe how healthy I feel now.  As a side<BR>
point, my fibromyalgia symptoms are virtually gone now too.  <BR>
<BR>
So, I remain on the diet, faithfully, and will continue to stay on it<BR>
for another year.  I just wanted to write in and tell everyone, because<BR>
I used to be really sick and weak and I never thought I would ever get<BR>
my health back.  So, everyone, hang in there.<BR>
<BR>

Dear Cheryl,<BR>
Did you taper off the Pentasa slowly? The reason I'm asking is because I<BR>
had a severe flare-up after abruptly stopping Rowasa enemas (Rowasa and<BR>
Pentasa are both 5-ASA drugs). About 12 years ago I participated in a<BR>
double<BR>
blind patient study for Rowasa retension enemas. As it turned out I got<BR>
the real thing, and in no time I was doing great. I used them nightly for a<BR>
few months and when the study was over I was told that's it, no more<BR>
enemas, and that it would be a couple years before they finished with the<BR>
approval process. I was a bit concerned about the severity of the<BR>
post-Rowasa flare-up, so I called the doctor to find out if there was any<BR>
way I could get<BR>
more enemas. He admitted that it wasn't a good idea to abruptly stop using<BR>
them, and he let me have a few boxes left over from a patient who had<BR>
dropped out of the study, and then I was able to successfully taper off. <BR>
Unfortunately a <BR>
few years later when<BR>
they finally went on the market they didn't work for me anymore.<BR>
Just to give you some encouragement that it is possible to get off the<BR>
drugs, I've been off all drugs for almost 4 years. Before I started the<BR>
diet I was on Prednisone, 12 Asacols, Rowasa enema every<BR>
night, and a cortenema in the afternoon to try to control my non-existent<BR>
bowel control. After a couple of months on the diet when I decided to stop<BR>
the drugs, I tapered off everything very slowly (not just the prednisone).<BR>
Remember, a few bumps in the road are to be expected, so don't get too<BR>
discouraged.<BR>
Keep us posted on your progress.<BR>
Lucy<BR>
PS. Have you tried the 1/2 and 1/2 yogurt? It might be good for the extra<BR>
calories, since you are concerned about your weight. <BR>
