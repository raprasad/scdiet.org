Subject: <B>Bread (Oh No! The &quot;B&quot; Word!) - long</B><BR>
<BR>
Well, this list has been so very helpful and encouraging so far.  I<BR>
hinted in one of my last pregnancy posts that I have one more major<BR>
hurdle to overcome before I join the ranks of the SCD-ers...<BR>
<BR>
See, I'm a strictly observant Jew (OK, &quot;orthodox&quot; - although I prefer<BR>
to avoid that label).  (&quot;Oh, no wonder she has so many kids...&quot;  ;-)) <BR>
That means I strive to maintain a high standard of food Kashrus<BR>
(&quot;kosherness&quot;) at all times and in all situations...<BR>
<BR>
I think this puts me at somewhat of an advantage vis-a-vis adopting<BR>
the SCD lifestyle.  I'm already a habitual food-label scrutinizer, and<BR>
have a healthy skepticism about what's printed on a package (even with<BR>
a kosher symbol).  I subscribe to kosher-consumer publications that<BR>
draw attention to food production methods and food mislabeling (the<BR>
number of mislabeled products listed in each issue is enough to curl<BR>
your hair!).  I think keeping kosher enhances my awareness of many<BR>
aspects of how different foods are made.  (For example, in BTVC, page<BR>
58, Elaine writes &quot;Use butter, not margarine.  Margarine contains<BR>
added milk solids and/or whey.&quot;  Well, any margarine with reliable<BR>
kosher supervision that bears the designation &quot;pareve&quot; *will* be<BR>
totally non-dairy - not that I'm a big fan of margarine, though.) <BR>
What else?  Restaurants? - well the relative number of restaurants in<BR>
which I can eat is pretty miniscule, and when I travel outside of<BR>
major Jewish neighborhoods into places where kosher restaurants are<BR>
nonexistent, I must prepare and bring along my own food, so I'm used<BR>
to all that.  Friends' homes?  Whenever I visit someone who doesn't<BR>
keep kosher, the only thing I can eat is raw fruit, anyway.  So, in a<BR>
sense, I'm used to self-denial and I don't think I'll miss much<BR>
(...except the sugar, and the cereal, and the potatoes, and the<BR>
chocolate, and... oh, never mind!)  ;-)<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, the SCD diet is not terribly dissimilar to what<BR>
observant Jews - specifically those who follow the stricter custom of<BR>
not eating &quot;gebrukts&quot; (matzos moistened with liquid) - eat during<BR>
Passover.  With the exclusion of plain matzos, potatoes/yams/parsnips,<BR>
fluid milk, sugar, and potato starch (a popular<BR>
flour/cornstarch-substitute on Passover), and with the inclusion of<BR>
many legumes (legumes are not eaten by Ashkenazic Jews on Passover), a<BR>
non-gebrukts Passover diet is amazingly similar to the SCD!  But I<BR>
digress...<BR>
<BR>
My problem involves the requirement to honor the Sabbath and major<BR>
holidays through the eating of *bread* with our festive meals.  In<BR>
Jewish Law, bread is defined as having been made from one or more of<BR>
the &quot;5 Grains&quot;: wheat, oats, rye, barley, or spelt.  There are two<BR>
meals on each Sabbath and holiday during which a minimum amount<BR>
(defined as &quot;the size of an olive&quot;) of such bread must be eaten.  Of<BR>
course I intend to consult my rabbi about this, as Jewish Law is often<BR>
lenient - on an individual, case-by-case basis - in situations where<BR>
one's health is involved.  Before I do so, however, I need to<BR>
ascertain what, if any, flexibility the SCD would permit in this<BR>
situation: are there specific grains that are less problematic than<BR>
others (such as spelt instead of wheat)?  Are yeast-free breads, like<BR>
matzo or certain crackers, preferable?  Or perhaps breads made from<BR>
sprouted whole grains instead of flour?<BR>
<BR>
So, my question boils down to this: IF, as I already suspect, proper<BR>
SCD-observance would *totally* prevent my eating two bites of *any*<BR>
kind of bread on each Sabbath and holiday, and IF my rabbi isn't<BR>
convinced that the possible health benefits of the SCD would outweigh<BR>
the Sabbath bread requirement, would this &quot;necessary cheating&quot; mean<BR>
that I may as well not even *bother* with the SCD?  Would I benefit<BR>
from at least following SCD as much as I can, with the exception of<BR>
eating a bit of bread once a week?<BR>
<BR>
If there's anyone else out there who is familiar with this problem,<BR>
I'd love to hear from you...<BR>
<BR>

Deanna<BR>
<BR>
PS - And dare I even *mention* the *major* religious requirement to<BR>
eat a substantial amount of *matzah* at the Passover seder, but that's<BR>
still about 9 months away...<BR>

Do you really think that GOD would expect you to jeopardize your health<BR>
for the sake of keeping the laws? I am a Jew, albeit a nonreligious one.<BR>
This is a very personal issue for you, I know, but with all due respect,<BR>
to ancient texts and your rabbi, your body is the temple of the Spirit.<BR>
Your body has its own laws, and because nothing that exists can exist<BR>
outside of GOD, that means your body is a holy temple. Treat your body as<BR>
it demands to be treated, with absolute trust in its wisdom. If eating<BR>
grains creates a negative reaction, your body's wisdom is crying out to<BR>
be heard.<BR>

I so very much appreciate your sharing.  Although I am not Jewish I do very<BR>
much respect the faith, the community and study as much as I can.  I have run<BR>
into a similar situation with my own faith.  I am a Roman Catholic 3rd Order<BR>
Nun.  We take communion daily as part of our lifestyle.  The host contains<BR>
wheat.  I was able to get permission to use rice wafers for my daily<BR>
communion.  I know the SCD does not allow rice, however it does not set off a<BR>
reaction in me and wheat sure does, so I purchased at my own expense (I don't<BR>
mind at all) a box of rice wafers from the Catholic Book Shoppe (enuff for 2<BR>
years LOL) at a very reasonable price and as long as I sit in the same seat<BR>
every day, which I do, I get my rice communion wafer when I go thru the line<BR>
and I am all set.<BR>
<BR>
There were some SCD'ers who opposed my taking even the small rice wafer daily,<BR>
but I am secure knowing that with my condition Celiac's Disease rice is<BR>
allowed on a traditional Celiac Diet, just not on the SCD.  I had to make this<BR>
tiny exception and remain<BR>
100% faithful to SCD otherwise.  Sometimes we must make tiny adjustments for<BR>
our faith.<BR>

Dear Deanna,<BR>
I basically agree with Paula, but got a chuckle out of your letter as<BR>
memories of childhood passovers flooded over me. Mostly positive of course,<BR>
with the exception of the blockages in my gut from the matzoh. Eight days<BR>
with no bowel movements. I am not a practicing Jew, but come from an<BR>
orthodox background (now, hold your tongue please). My wonderful Grampa<BR>
(the Rabbi), always told me that health came first and he himself took life<BR>
giving medicine even on Yom Kippur (a day of complete fasting, for those of<BR>
you who dont know). I dont know if a piece chalah (bread) the size of an<BR>
olive could eradicate the affect of the diet. I dont know if not having it<BR>
would cause you enormous stress (only you can answer that) but I would<BR>
consult with the rabbi and ask his advice, but do make sure he understand<BR>
the nature of your illness. Too many people totally misunderstand this<BR>
disease and think us as having &quot;nervous&quot; stomachs and we ourselves are<BR>
sometimes guilty of underplaying the toll this takes on our lives.<BR>
Should you decide that you must have the bread, please do not dismiss the<BR>
possible benefit of the rest of the diet and please keep us posted.<BR>

Oh, Edith - thank you so much for your response!  As a matter of fact,<BR>
when I formulated my post I got to wondering how people of other<BR>

Hi, Paula<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure why you changed the Subject line read to &quot;Bread and the<BR>
Bible,&quot; since in my post I made no reference to the Bible, but if it<BR>
makes more sense to you this way, I don't mind.<BR>
<BR>

Perhaps you missed where I wrote: &quot;Of course I intend to consult my<BR>
rabbi about this, as Jewish Law is often lenient - on an individual,<BR>
case-by-case basis - in situations where one's health is involved.&quot; <BR>
If my intention had been to blindly keep eating bread on the Sabbath<BR>
without bothering to consult with an expert in Jewish Law in order to<BR>
find out what leniency would apply in my individual case, then what<BR>
was the point of posting my question?  The reason I posted my question<BR>
was to test how far I can push the SCD envelope - *also* as it applies<BR>
to my individual case - by delving into whether there's some<BR>
flexibility with the bread issue, and perhaps to determine what sort<BR>
of bread-alternative - *if necessary* - would be most benign,<BR>
SCD-wise.  That way I can be better-prepared to present complete and<BR>
thorough information to my rabbi to enable him to make a<BR>
fully-informed determination that is best for my individual<BR>
circumstances.  If there is *no* flexibility with the SCD, then my<BR>
rabbi needs to know that, too!<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I am a Jew, albeit a nonreligious one.  This is a very personal<BR>
&gt; issue for you, I know,<BR>
<BR>
Not really - if it were all that personal, I wouldn't have written so<BR>
openly about it.  For all I know, there may be other Sabbath-observers<BR>
out there lurking on this list who are pondering the same questions,<BR>
or who have first-hand experiences to share about how they worked this<BR>
issue out.  There might even be others who would appreciate reading<BR>
about how people from diverse walks of life can adapt the SCD and make<BR>
it work for them without feeling that they must compromise their<BR>
values and priorities.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; but with all due respect, to ancient texts and your rabbi,<BR>
<BR>
Again, I didn't refer anywhere in my post to ancient texts - I'm only<BR>
concerned with how contemporary halacha (Jewish Law) applies to my<BR>
individual circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; your body is the temple of the Spirit.  Your body has its own laws,<BR>
<BR>
My body was designed by the same Creator whom I honor by my observance<BR>
of the Sabbath.  The injunction to guard my health is every bit as<BR>
much a part of Judaism as the one to honor the Sabbath.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; and because nothing that exists can exist outside of GOD,<BR>
<BR>
Well, we do agree on that!  :-)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; that means your body is a holy temple. Treat your body as it<BR>
&gt; demands to be treated, with absolute trust in its wisdom. If<BR>
&gt; eating grains creates a negative reaction, your body's wisdom<BR>
&gt; is crying out to be heard.<BR>
<BR>
Believe me, Paula, if you knew more about me personally you'd know how<BR>
much I fervently believe in the body's innate wisdom, a wisdom steeped<BR>
in the will of Hashem (G-d).  Teaching and guiding others to trust<BR>
their bodies is a huge part of who I am and what I do.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; blessings,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the bracha!  :-)<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, I posted the same question - albeit with the empasis<BR>
shifted to questioning the limits of Jewish Law rather than<BR>
questioning the limits of the SCD - to another list that is frequented<BR>
by many observant Jewish women.  Not one of them challenged the<BR>
necessity of my following the SCD to the letter; allow me to quote<BR>
some of them:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you ask a knowledgeable rav, he will probably say it is fine to<BR>
keep to this diet since it is most definitely for your health.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can't imagine any situation that the halacha would not exempt<BR>
someone for medical reasons.  I also know (observant) individuals who<BR>
do not eat challah on Shabbos due to treatment for various eating<BR>
disorders (compulsive eating.)  So, yes, there is a precedent for your<BR>
situation... there is precedent for not eating challah on Shabbos!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are heterim (leniencies) to not do something.. I almost got a<BR>
heter to not have to drink the arbah kosot (4 cups of wine) at the<BR>
seder but I found a minimum thing that I could be satisfied with<BR>
halachically and medically...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Paula, all I'm trying to do is to test the limits of *both*<BR>
disciplines, with the goal of establishing that elusive common ground<BR>
that would enable me to reep the rich benefits of each one without<BR>
sacrificing the other.  It is both appropriate and expected for<BR>
observant Jews to constantly ask questions and explore the boundaries<BR>
of halacha in order to overcome perceived obstacles to its<BR>
observance.  With all due respect, I will follow SCD with no more<BR>
blind faith than that with which you seem to think that I follow<BR>
halacha.<BR>
<BR>
E-mail is a medium which places us all at a communication<BR>
disadvantage: without the benefit of seeing one another's facial<BR>
expressions or hearing the tone of our voices, our posts can often<BR>
seem more harsh than we intend them to.  Perhaps I erroneously<BR>
perceived that your post was a bit judgemental, and perhaps I<BR>
responded a bit more defensively than I should have.  If so, please<BR>
accept my apology.<BR>

<BR>
You've made an excellent point!  By nature, I'm an easygoing,<BR>
non-complaining kind of person, and have always been as healthy as a<BR>
horse!  I don't feel comfortable having people feel sorry for me, and<BR>
I always downplay my problems, so you've impressed on me the need to<BR>
make it abundantly clear to the rabbi that CD is a serious, incurable<BR>
chronic illness with potentially dangerous complications, regardless<BR>
of how mild my case has (apparently) been so far... the goal is to<BR>
*keep* it mild!<BR>

<BR>
Hi Deanna,<BR>
<BR>
I changed the subject line for fun. I had no idea you would take it<BR>
personally. Is it offensive? If so, please know that was not at all my<BR>
intention.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You wrote...<BR>
<BR>
&lt;Perhaps you missed where I wrote: &quot;Of course I intend to consult my<BR>
rabbi about this...&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please understand, I am coming from a different perspective. When you say<BR>
that you consult the rabbi on the Jewish Law, you've already lost me. You<BR>
see, from where I sit, I go within to get answers. Please do not take<BR>
this as an attack. I am in the minority here. Most people go to experts<BR>
for advice. I believe that such answers can be found within. If a rabbi<BR>
told me something that went against my intuitive knowing, then I would<BR>
trust myself, not the rabbi nor the Jewish Laws.<BR>
<BR>
My sense is that I offended you. I tend to speak the truth as I view it.<BR>
Your response felt like an attack in turn. This type of exchange was not<BR>
my intention. I do feel strongly that as individuals we tend to give our<BR>
power away to authorities, whether the authority figure be a person or a<BR>
sacred text or a book of contemporary laws.<BR>
<BR>
Same thing with the SCD. Elaine has provided us with a gift. Each person<BR>
then integrates the diet in a way that their body dictates as best. Each<BR>
of us varies intake to suit our individual needs, based on how it makes<BR>
one feel. That makes good sense to me. I feel that way about religion AND<BR>
its laws. That's just me.<BR>
<BR>
I appreciate this forum as a wonderful place to share experiences with<BR>
the diet, yet each body is unique. And so are we. It makes for a<BR>
wonderfully diverse and rich world. As we learn what our bodies are<BR>
telling us in every moment, we will move to greater and greater levels of<BR>
vitality, and we can assist one another in finding that source of wisdom<BR>
within. I believe that is the highest spiritual teaching when it comes to<BR>
caring for these bodies we inhabit.<BR>
<BR>
Your original post voiced your concern about a potential conflict between<BR>
your religious concerns and the SCD restrictions. In my way of thinking,<BR>
there is no conflict between the two. For the reasons I mention above,<BR>
the diet that alleviates my intestinal disease would be of utmost<BR>
importance, because in caring for my body, I am respecting my Soul.<BR>

blessings of love,<BR>

<BR>
Boy am I staying out of this one. I'm a VERY ethically oriented atheist.<BR>
Even militantly so. I'm also a very committed vegetarian. Because of<BR>
this diet, I was feeling weak and undernourished, so, after 8 years<BR>
without, I ate some fish last week, and twice since. It sucked<BR>
emotionally, but physically it seemed to help. Intellectually, I just<BR>
told myself we all do what we have to to get by. Whether my &quot;laws&quot; come<BR>
internally, or from religion or the state or the SCD, I'm the sort that<BR>
challenges them, redefines them, whatever. You may not be that sort.<BR>
Nothing wrong with doing what you think is right, whether that serves<BR>
the interest of your health or some other interest, just make sure<BR>
you're pretty certain what &quot;right&quot; is for you.<BR>
<BR>
I'd be happy to discuss the concept of faith, or blind faith or<BR>
authority privately whith whomever, but here, on this list, I'll try and<BR>
stick to science and support. Scientifically, it does seem rational to<BR>
follow the diet 100% where starches are concerned for best health<BR>
results. If some other criteria outweighs your health, then by all<BR>
means, follow that. I don't think a little diet cheating on non-starches<BR>
would matter as much (ie. eating a few nuts before 6 months). Best luck<BR>
with whatever you decide.<BR>

Dear Ruth,<BR>
<BR>
As I understand Deanna's original question, I am directly responding to<BR>
her request for input:  I am writing with the intention of pointing out<BR>
the importance of, above all, paying attention to our bodies' innate<BR>
wisdom....<BR>
<BR>
I may have touched a few nerves here, but I respect everyone's choices<BR>
about everything. Is it disrespectful to bring up points for discussion?<BR>
In my opinion, healthy discussion brings an expanded potential for<BR>
greater choices. If I am secure in my views, and another person is secure<BR>
in theirs, where is the threat? I enjoy sharing perspectives in all<BR>
arenas, especially regarding physical and spiritual nourishment, and as<BR>
David infers, refining one's perceptions and redefining one's beliefs are<BR>
a wonderful part of the process of being alive...a part I wouldn't miss<BR>
for the world. <BR>
<BR>
in Joy and Love,<BR>
<BR>
Paula<BR>

<BR>
After reading Deanna's list about eating bread on the Sabbath,  brings up<BR>
the question about the small piece of bread/or wafer and wine at communion.<BR>
Although I have been following the SCD for the most part I have to say I<BR>
have not been 100%.  I have received communion and not worried about it.  I<BR>
have mild UC and am doing well.  For severe sufferers does communion pose a<BR>
problem?<BR>
