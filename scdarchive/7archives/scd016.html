<BR>
How long have you been on the diet?:<BR>
8 months<BR>
<BR>
Age?:<BR>
31<BR>
<BR>
Male or Female?:<BR>
female<BR>
<BR>
Do you have Crohn's, UC, or IBS?:<BR>
UC<BR>
<BR>
How long have you had the disease (In years &amp; months)?:<BR>
~ 5 years<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, how religiously do you follow the diet? (1 meaning<BR>
cheating all the time, 10 meaning never cheating):<BR>
9<BR>
<BR>
If you ever &quot;cheat&quot; on the diet, what foods are you eating that
are not <BR>
on the diet, and what happens (symptoms if any) when you do?<BR>
I have eaten pasta, rice, potato chips,carrot cake,non-homemade <BR>
yoghurt,milk in tea, chocolate and little baby corns. I have not cheated
<BR>
on a continuous type basis, it has only ever been a one off type thing.
<BR>
I have not experienced any symptoms that I could relate to cheating with
<BR>
respect to my UC. The only thing I did experience was after eating a <BR>
piece of chocolate I got a migraine, needless to say this was enough to
<BR>
discourage me from cheating with chocolate again.<BR>
<BR>
What medications are you also taking at the same time you are on the <BR>
diet?<BR>
Except for a duration of about 3 weeks I have been on prednisone the <BR>
whole time I have been on the diet. At the same time once I was at 30 mg
<BR>
prednisone I resumed taking 5 ASA as well.<BR>
<BR>
Has your medication regime or dosages changed within 1-2 months of <BR>
starting the diet (either before or after starting)?<BR>
I have reduced from 40 mg down to 0, a bad flare up sent me back to 20 <BR>
mg, another bad flare sent me back to 40 mg and now down to 10 mg and <BR>
continuing down, all since being on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Do you feel your change in symptoms (if any) was due to the diet, or your<BR>
medications, or both?<BR>
Until I had the flare ups I felt sure that the diet was the reason I was
<BR>
able to reduce the prednisone because I had been at 40 mg for a number of
<BR>
months prior to that without any improvement, in fact I was getting <BR>
worse. However, the flare ups and the necessity to go back on the <BR>
prednisone while still sticking faithfully to the diet has made me <BR>
somewhat reserved. For me I will have to get off medication and be able
<BR>
to continue for an extended period without a flare up before I will be <BR>
more convinced.<BR>
<BR>
What supplements/vitamins are you also taking at the same time you are on
<BR>
the<BR>
diet, how long have you been taking them, and do you feel they help?<BR>
<BR>
multi-vitamin, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A &amp; D, calcium, garlic,
<BR>
alfalfa, evening primrose oil, cat's claw, lactobacillus acidophilus <BR>
tablets, aloe, caprylic acid off and on (Yikes, that's a lot!)<BR>
<BR>
Describe your diet/eating habits before you went on the SCD?<BR>
<BR>
Bad habits would have been a lot of coke and potato chips. I ate very <BR>
little meat and when I do it is usually chicken. Staples would be pasta
<BR>
and rice and vegetable type dishes.<BR>
<BR>
Do you eliminate or avoid any foods other than those listed in the book?<BR>
<BR>
I find that I cannot eat the breads and muffins made with the nut flour.
<BR>
All the nuts just seem too indigestable for me. I just do without any <BR>
kind of bread type of food these days.<BR>
<BR>
Are there any foods that the diet disallows, which you still eat because
<BR>
they don't seem to bother you?<BR>
Not on a regular basis.<BR>
<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, 1 meaning no improvement, 10 meaning all symtoms <BR>
are gone since following the diet; How much do you feel the diet has helped
your<BR>
symptoms?:<BR>
Too difficult at this time to distinguish between diet and medication <BR>
and the nature of the disease.<BR>
<BR>
Would you recommend the diet to other people with IBD?:<BR>
I would definitely recommend that the diet is worth trying.<BR>
<BR>
Does your doctor know you are following the diet?:<BR>
Yes<BR>
<BR>
If so, does he have an opinion on it (approve, disapprove, comments)?:<BR>
My experience has been that all those in the medical profession who I <BR>
have talked to about this diet are extremely skeptical or at best <BR>
reserved in their opinion of the diet. However, I do think that they <BR>
realize that at some point when faced with a disease which is not <BR>
improving by any other means trying something non-conventional, or <BR>
unscientific is something that people are going to do. If it works, <BR>
great, as long as no harm is done in the process.<BR>
<BR>
How did you find out about the diet?<BR>
My parents and desparation made me go on it and stay on it.<BR>
<BR>
Any other comments about the diet plan?:<BR>
I too wish that there was more science associated with this diet than <BR>
anecdotal accounts. I see this diet as an elimination of just about <BR>
anything that has been known to cause ill effects in some people and I <BR>
question the necessity for that. However, since there is no established
<BR>
cause for IBD it seems that it would be difficult to do anything else. I
<BR>
guess each individual at some time must determine what they can and <BR>
cannot add back to their diet. But just the fact that at some point you
<BR>
are supposed to be able to add things back just strikes me as odd.<BR>
<BR>
Just one other interesting thing to note, I had a huge, very sore <BR>
planters wart on my foot for about 10 years which I had to live with <BR>
because removing it would have left a big hole in my foot supposedly. Two
<BR>
months or so into the diet I realized one day that it was gone, <BR>
completely, you would never know it had been there! Whether it was the <BR>
diet or the anti-yeast type supplements I was taking or both, this I <BR>
thought was amazing. And whether the diet has had any affect on my UC or
<BR>
not, I can say it was worth having been on it just for this.<BR>

Able to eat all foods listed in the book without problems<BR>

I would definitely recommend the diet to others and have.<BR>
Doctor is aware we are on the diet.<BR>
Doctor doubts it's value but says it won't hurt to try. Haven't seen doctor<BR>
since starting the diet and having such wonderful results. Next appointment<BR>
is next week.<BR>
The diet is difficult to follow at first but is very do-able once you get
the<BR>
hang of it and as long as you plan ahead. Although it first appears very<BR>
limiting it isn't once you know what you can eat and keep those foods<BR>
available.<BR>

cheating all the time, 10 meaning never cheating):<BR>
cheated for my first time last week, so I was at a 10 until then, am<BR>
planning on going back on the diet but will probably cheat occasionally
now<BR>
that the first time is out of the way, so I will probably be about a 7<BR>
<BR>

rare since starting the diet).<BR>
<BR>
Do you eliminate or avoid any foods other than those listed in the book?<BR>
I have recently eliminated peanut butter from my diet because others<BR>
in my email group seem to have a lot of trouble with it. It hasn't been<BR>

<BR>
On a scale of 1 - 10, 1 meaning no improvement, 10 meaning all symtoms are

since following the diet; How much do you feel the diet has helped your<BR>

<BR>

No.<BR>
<BR>
If so, does he have an opinion on it (approve, disapprove, comments)?:<BR>
<BR>
Any other comments about the diet plan?:<BR>
Hasn't been as hard to follow as I thought it would be. It's true<BR>
what it says in the book about noticing results right away. I didn't<BR>
believe the diet would work when I first tried it so it can't be a placebo<BR>
effect. I'm not sure if the premis behind the diet outlined in the book
is<BR>
100% correct, but I do know that something is going on because I am feeling<BR>
so much better and taking less medication than I have in months.<BR>

I have been on the diet just three weeks. I am a 60 year old male <BR>
with UC for 4 years &amp; 4 months. I religiously follow the diet (10),
<BR>
only drinking coffee three times per day. I take prednisone, and <BR>
calcium and iron supplements. The only permitted food which I avoid <BR>
is peanuts. I eat nothing not in the book. My improvement so far is <BR>
about a seven (7), and I would recommend the diet to others. My <BR>
doctor does not know, but on my next visit I will inform him. He will <BR>
probably not have much of an opinion. If three weeks is any <BR>
indication, and I am able to get off prednisone, I will praise the <BR>
diet to the heavens!<BR>
