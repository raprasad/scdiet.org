i have been following this group for a few months...i was drawn here<BR>
because of<BR>
the health problems i was experiencing with my intestines, etc. i modified<BR>
my diet<BR>
but at the time could not get enough info about the Diet to follow it. i<BR>
did start<BR>
eating more yogurt and less bread/carbos...but i was still dragging around<BR>
week<BR>
to week, day to day...no energy and lots of pain...<BR>
well, i moved to this new apartment three and a half weeks ago and i have<BR>
to tell<BR>
you all something...the pain is gone!! the energy is returning...i'm<BR>
starting to<BR>
feel more like Me again...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
i wonder, i just wonder....the other house had a terrible moisture<BR>
problem....i had<BR>
mold and mildew climbing up the walls in the bedroom and there was NO WAY<BR>
to get rid of it...i tried for 3 years...this new house is<BR>
dry...totally..with lots of sunlight<BR>
so that the mold and mildew won't even make an appearance.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is it possible that my body was reacting to the 'spores' in the air??? and<BR>
that's what<BR>
was causing an auto-immune response?? could it possibly be so??<BR>

        Dear Arlene,<BR>
                   Sure it is very possible, my sister -inlaw just called<BR>
me two weeks ago all excited that maybe she found a cure for me. ( I'm the<BR>
one with Behcets ) She ran into a friend who had been sick for years and<BR>
this women  found a doctor that put her on a diet similar to the SCD but<BR>
she is very allergic to mold spores. She only eats meat without additives,<BR>
she cannot leave fruit or vegetables out on the counter for even a short<BR>
while , ( since the doctor told her it develops spores in a very short<BR>
time. Well long story short , the regime this lady followed fixed all that<BR>
ails her.<BR>
        I wish it was so simple for myself, this diet has greatly helped my<BR>
colon.Now I need to find cures for the other parts of me that ail.<BR>
         My first flare of Behcets was at age 18 to 19 and a half , I am now 43.<BR>
Funny thing is that I went into a  controllable phase all the way up to age<BR>
39  is just co- incidence that I went on Doctor Atkins at age 19 and a half<BR>
.( I had packed on a few newly wed lbs ) His diet sure is similar to the<BR>
SCD.<BR>
        Sadly my hunt for a total cure is still on as I have neuro involvement, if<BR>
I could beat these headaches I would be singing from the hill tops. Also I<BR>
have a lot of muscle degeneration.<BR>
        A while back someone wrote about what Behcets is  it was a very misleading<BR>
and limited description. Here is my description of what Behcets is although<BR>
I will miss many symptoms , I think all will get the idea. I will list the<BR>
ones that seem to be shared by almost all in our Behcet's group. Plus some<BR>
shared by luckily a few ( Blindness)<BR>
                                           Mouth and genital cankers (<BR>
Mouth more frequent)<BR>
                                            Arthritis          ( unlike<BR>
what was written it does not take a<BR>
                                                                      long<BR>
time to develop , especially when aided<BR>
                                                                       by<BR>
large doses of pred. )<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                               Involvement of the entire digestive tract.<BR>
from the mouth right down to the rectum and vagina, Often mis diagnosed as<BR>
CD or UC. This also includes the sinuses.       ( this along with head<BR>
trouble was my first symptom bad enough to complain about)<BR>
                                 Neuro involvement     Migraines ,<BR>
peripheral neuropathy  over ninety percent of the people in our behcets<BR>
group which numbers 150 have a big problem with head troubles. MRI's show<BR>
white patches on the brain from the headaches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                           Skin rashes and photo sensitivity .<BR>
                           Only 25 % of United states patients respond to<BR>
the pin prick test.<BR>
                             Blindness , luckily in the US this also runs<BR>
at a low percent.<BR>
                              Fatigue and muscle degeneration<BR>
                             It can also attack the organ of it's choice<BR>
        Now here is an interesting tidbit Behcets people all seem to gain weight<BR>
in large amounts when put on steroids. All the people I know with CD still<BR>
seem to lose even when on large doses. So if you gain while on them think<BR>
about Behcets. ( That is only my personal observation)<BR>
                           I try very hard to get people on our Behcets<BR>
list  to try the Scd or variations of it . I would say the ten of us on the<BR>
list that use alternative methods and special diets are in the best shape.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Now here is what really bugged me on the post someone else wrote about<BR>
Behcets that it seems to run in ten year cycles. WRONG !!!!! Many in our<BR>
group have been suffering for 20 , 30 and even more years.  We have quite a<BR>
few teens with it also. Even some babies, it can strike a person at ANY<BR>
AGE.<BR>
        I have not covered all the symptoms but I hope it will give all of you a<BR>
bit of a clearer picture of just what Behcets is.<BR>
         I am so happy that you have found relief Arlene , I would suggest if you<BR>
think mold is a big problem for you that you keep your fruit and veggies in<BR>
the fridge and scrub them just before eating. I hope you still limit your<BR>
bread and other carbo intake. I lent my SCd diet book to a women in England<BR>
, but when I get it back I would gladly mail it to you.<BR>
                                                       Take Care,<BR>
                                                                     Kay<BR>

 Regarding what Dietmar said below, this kind of thinking disturbs me. It's<BR>
&gt; too much like that of M.D.'s who prescribe their usual medicines but are<BR>
&gt; not willing to consider the SCD diet or other alternatives.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
        Dear Tom ,<BR>
                    I could not agree with you more, We surly do not want<BR>
to become guilty of just what many  doctor's  are guilty of. Questions are<BR>
a good thing. We are each unique after all.<BR>
         I am sure that Dietmar did not  mean to sound so harsh, but we all need<BR>
to be careful about not judging another and being there to help not<BR>
criticize. I got beat up on this list for a question months ago and just<BR>
became a lurker for three months .      Example  sometimes it seems to me that<BR>
yogurt just becomes to much of a focus to people on this, I have absolutely<BR>
no trouble WITHOUT yogurt. I never liked the stuff anyway. But I don't mind<BR>
seeing all the discussion on it for it could be a key for someone else. But<BR>
one does not have to have it. I am proof of that.<BR>
        Also we have to keep in mind that some people have not had access to the<BR>
book , so we are all here to (gently) help them with their questions.<BR>
        I am home from camp today to do laundry so after my long post to Arlene I<BR>
need to wrap this up. But here is a little idea if a couple people have the<BR>
time maybe they could post  a Sunday through Sat sample menu of what they<BR>
eat in a week. I bet that would help the people who cannot access the book.<BR>
                                                         Take Care,<BR>
                                                                      Kay<BR>

Hi Arlene<BR>

<BR>
I can only confirm your experience. Last year I had to spent a couple of<BR>
months in a damp and mouldy house and it nearly killed me. That is<BR>
definitely due to a weakended immunsystem.<BR>

That is a good question and I really think that it would save a lot of<BR>
time and trouble.  I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work, and<BR>
I'm curious to see what other people in the group think about it.  Maybe<BR>
someone who is in contact with Elaine needs to ask about it.<BR>

If the yogurt was done fermenting after the temperature is no longer at<BR>
100-110F, then how could we use the commercial yogurt as a starter?<BR>
Obviously, the bacteria present in the yogurt are still active enough to<BR>
eat up all the lactose in the milk that we boil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone,<BR>
Does anyone know if there is a kit to test for the lactose content of<BR>
foods?  If this was the case we could try this easier method of making<BR>
yogurt.<BR>

What about leaving unripe fruit on the counter to ripen, like tomatoes,<BR>
mangoes, or avacados?  Is mold growing?  I never heard this before?  Does<BR>
anyone else know more about this mold thing?<BR>

About the commercial yogurt, I don't know WHY, but I don't think it would work<BR>
to try fermenting store bought yogurt as is.  I thought that as soon as you<BR>
chill the yogurt, it stops the fermentation process.  But I still don't know<BR>
why it works as starter.  What about other fermented products?  Would the same<BR>
principal work? I mean, with cheeses, the longer it's left, the stronger it<BR>
gets (eg. mild, medium, or old cheddar), but if you leave it out on the<BR>
counter, it will spoil and go moldy, it won't improve and get older and<BR>
stronger.  What about wine?  Why doesn't it turn to vinegar if you leave it<BR>
out, or does it?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, it seems that it's some sort of chemical reaction process that must start<BR>
with boiled milk, in order to eliminate all but the right kind of bacteria.<BR>
Why doesn't someone try it, just for the heck of it, and let us know what<BR>
happens.  Personally, I have my doubts about any commercial yogurt because I<BR>
could never tolerate the homemade yogurt that I made using commercial yogurt as<BR>
a starter, but then when I bought powedered starter, I had no problem.  This<BR>
makes me wonder if there are not some other additives in the commercial yogurt<BR>
which are not listed, or if they are using some sort of different culture.<BR>
Something is different from the powdered, that's for sure, we just don't know<BR>
what it is.<BR>

        Behcets sounds omnious...and difficult to pinpoint. i surely hope<BR>
you get well...<BR>
        i just got Elaine's book (i'm assuming that's the SCD diet book you<BR>
are talking<BR>
        about)...unfortunately, i can't get a lot of the stuff included in<BR>
the diet over here..<BR>
        but i'm not sure exactly what my problem is...the MD said<BR>
'stress'...his blanket<BR>
        diagnosis whenever he sees a single, working woman in this culture,<BR>
i'll bet...<BR>
        and since i've cut back on some of the 'baddies' i am feeling much<BR>
much better.<BR>
        we'll see what happens when the weather changes and it gets damp here..<BR>
        we badly need rain...but my body's happy this way...and my tummy's<BR>
fine...<BR>
        if i feel a bit 'sluggish' i just take a tablet called &quot;Pankreon&quot;..i<BR>
think it's manufactured<BR>
        in Finland...don't know if it's available stateside..it stimulates<BR>
the pancreas or it<BR>
        replaces the pancreatic enzymes that my body doesn't want to produce!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        the ingredients say '8000 lipase 6500 Amylase - 450 Protease and<BR>
something<BR>
        called 'F.I.P.  212.5 mg.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        what do any of you know about this medication? it seems to help me<BR>
when i need it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        also, i've been eating yogurt 3-7 times a week and watermelon for<BR>
dinner..which<BR>
        helps enormously!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        i don't know what is doing the trick, but i am almost myself again!!<BR>
        thank for caring and sharing Kay...<BR>
        good luck to you too.<BR>

        I hope all will work on answering any and all questions in a kind tone and<BR>

This is from Dietmar: true, you're right.  It's just that, having been an<BR>
&quot;intellectual&quot; most of my life, I find that people who &quot;think too much&quot; and<BR>
are &quot;head tripping&quot; all the time forget to &quot;get on with the job&quot; ... they<BR>
keep worrying / pondering / asking intellectual questions instead of having<BR>
a life and getting out there and DOING stuff to get results, THEN examining<BR>
and refining.  They tend to put the cart before the horse: thinking /<BR>
navel-gazing interminably and discussing tiny teeny semantics to minutae<BR>
instead of just &quot;getting with the program&quot; and seeing what happens.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So sure, nobody would make ANY progress and find any solutions to problems<BR>
(such as ours, of IBD) if they didn't use their head, ask questions, and<BR>
think things through, but there comes a point when you're better off to<BR>
just put all that &quot;wheel-spinning&quot; on the shelf for a while and just get on<BR>

I'm a type O, and I seem to be able to tolerate the Elaine-style yoghurt,<BR>
but definitely NO other dairy products.  And I already was intolerant to<BR>
dairy products since about age 6 (diarrhoea, gas), so it's not &quot;in my<BR>
imagination&quot;.  But her yoghurt seems to work quite fine, I've concluded<BR>

Absolutely; which is why I read d'Adamo's book, and Sears' book, and my<BR>
physiology books, to see &quot;why isn't her diet working for me 100%?&quot;  But<BR>
meanwhile I'm nevertheless applying her principles, plus keeping a food<BR>
diary for my own personal &quot;detective work&quot; to weed out what parts of her<BR>
method do NOT work for me, and what I need to change.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My point is: keep a balance between &quot;doing&quot; and &quot;pondering&quot;, and don't bet<BR>

&gt;What about wine?  Why doesn't it turn to vinegar if you leave it<BR>
&gt;out, or does it?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I believe it does.  Ever taken a winery tour?  Notice how it's same as what<BR>
I just mentioned: temperature &amp; moisture controlled ... cool dark &quot;wine<BR>
cellars&quot;, except the &quot;modern&quot; wineries do it with machinery &amp;<BR>
electronically-controlled stainless steel vats, but the concept's the same.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So maybe that ties in with Arlene's &amp; others' comments about mold: if we<BR>
keep our OWN bodies under the &quot;right&quot; conditions of temperature &amp; humidity,<BR>
we are healthy, if not (such as perhaps the &quot;Wet Coast&quot; we here in British<BR>
Columbia live on?) we get / stay ill?  I don't know, but it's an<BR>
interesting concept to tuck into the back of one's mind.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If anyone out there is willing to spend some time doing websearching on<BR>
&quot;morbidity&quot; (meaning &quot;the frequency of a disease in a population) or<BR>
&quot;epidemiology&quot; for colitis &amp; IBD &amp; Crohn's, we could get together some<BR>
reallly useful facts about which parts of the world have highest vs. lowest<BR>
incidences.<BR>
<BR>

        Dietmar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;So, it seems that it's some sort of chemical reaction process that must start<BR>
&gt;with boiled milk, in order to eliminate all but the right kind of bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Actually, I believe it's to eliminate virtually ALL bacteria; then, by<BR>
adding the starter / powder, you're &quot;seeding&quot; the &quot;sterile&quot; (although<BR>
nothing is ever totally sterile, otherwise it wouldn't function anymore!)<BR>
milk with the type of bacteria that will do the job you want done.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                Dietmar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Why doesn't someone try it, just for the heck of it, and let us know what<BR>
&gt;happens.  Personally, I have my doubts about any commercial yogurt because I<BR>
&gt;could never tolerate the homemade yogurt that I made using commercial<BR>
yogurt as<BR>
&gt;a starter, but then when I bought powedered starter, I had no problem.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, there are so many variable: if you look at the Yogourmet packet,<BR>
you'll note is has several types of bacteria listed.  Then take a look at<BR>
different brands of &quot;live&quot; store yoghurt ... the type of bacteria will<BR>
differ (yoghurt is usually made from any of 4 different types, so they may<BR>
use 1 or 2 or 3 or all 4), so I would surmise that if you use different<BR>
type of bacteria, you'll get a different type of fermentation thus a diff.<BR>
result in the body?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Dietmar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;This<BR>
&gt;makes me wonder if there are not some other additives in the commercial<BR>
yogurt<BR>
&gt;which are not listed, or if they are using some sort of different culture.<BR>
&gt;Something is different from the powdered, that's for sure, we just don't know<BR>
&gt;what it is.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yep.  Or it could be WHERE it's made (i.e. Montreal) as compared to, for<BR>
example, Astra made in Delta or Vancouver or whereever?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We can't tell at this point.  All we can tell is, as you so wisely point<BR>
out, &quot;what works and what doesn't&quot;, right?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Which reiterates what I've said to someone else about &quot;sometimes ya just<BR>
gotta stop head tripping and go with what works, worry about the &quot;why's&quot;<BR>
later, for now, just do the right thing&quot;.  I mean, how much time does one<BR>
want to spend worrying about all the &quot;if's &amp; why's&quot;, when you've already<BR>
found at least SOME methods that work?<BR>

&gt;You have to have proper storage conditions, a combination of &gt;&quot;correct&quot;<BR>
moisture content in the air PLUS temperature; same idea of &gt;how good<BR>
butcher shops age their meat: they have special coolers &gt;which control<BR>
those 2 factors, whereas if we at home &quot;hang our meat&quot;, &gt;which is what<BR>
butchers call it, I believe, it just gets rotten, &gt;right?<BR>

Don't we already know the proper conditions for fermenting yogurt?  We<BR>
could just put the same commercial yogurt in a yogurt maker without<BR>
adding any boiled milk and leave it for 24 hours.  I am willing to try<BR>
it, because I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work, but there would<BR>
be no way to test if all the lactose is gone.  When you make yogurt out<BR>
of milk you can tell if it worked by whether or not it solidifies.  This<BR>

Try it and let us know the result.  My prediction is that it gets runny and<BR>
doesn't work.  At least we can see if it &quot;looks&quot; right, even if you won't know<BR>
about the lactose.  If you did it and it did look right, you could probably<BR>
assume the lactose was gone.  I think you'll be able to tell by the<BR>
consistency, smell and the abscence of visible mold if it worked.  Let's see.<BR>

&gt;hi anna...yes, tomatoes get moldy if i leave them out..but that's true even in<BR>
&gt;this new house.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm talking about putting UNRIPE fruit on the kitchen counter until it ripens.<BR>
I left an unripe mango out for a week and I didn't notice any visible mold.  It<BR>
just ripens.  Same with avacados.  When you buy them at the grocery store, most<BR>
fruits are hard as a rock and UNRIPE.  If you put them in the fridge, they<BR>
don't ripen.  Do other people out there do this too, or are you saying that<BR>
there is invisible mold developing and that's why we should keep everything in<BR>
the fridge?  If that is the case, then everything ripe that you buy is chalk<BR>
full of mold.  I don't think so.  Please comment anyone.<BR>

        I did not mean to send anyone on a mission to experiment with re-fermented<BR>
yogurt. Also there can't be a whole lot of lactose left in the comercial<BR>
stuff I wouldn't think, or it wouldn't be yogurt. I also don't think you<BR>
could tell by the consistency because it was already yogurt consistence to<BR>
begin with. Right?<BR>
I think the key would be to test somehow for the amount of lactose if<BR>
that's what we're all so worried about.<BR>

Lutz' diet looks very much like the SCD. It is not as extreme, though, but<BR>
generally, it is the same things that should be avoided.<BR>

For instance, in Lutz's diet bread is allowed, if only you eat very little of<BR>

Another issue with commercial yogurt in addition to the lactose problem is<BR>
the added sugar, gelatin and what else they put into it. If one could<BR>
re-ferment it for 20 or so additonal hours the sugar (corn syrup) would<BR>
still be there.<BR>

&gt; Does anyone else on the list have irritable bowel syndrome, or another<BR>
kind of<BR>
&gt;  &quot;benign&quot; diagnosis doctors give after ruling out cancer, inflammatory<BR>
&gt; conditions, colitis, or Chron's? I had some success with the diet<BR>
initially<BR>
&gt; but have had trouble sticking with it lately, in part because I tell<BR>
myself<BR>
&gt; that since I haven't been diagnosed with a &quot;serious&quot; condition, it may<BR>
not be<BR>
&gt; necessary to follow the SCD diet so strictly.   I know that the diet must<BR>
be<BR>
&gt; an all-or-nothing commitment.   I've eliminated grains and sugar, but<BR>
I've<BR>
&gt; been drinking not-so-weak coffee with milk-- the hardest habit to break.<BR>
I<BR>
&gt; guess I need some more will power and more information.  The SCD book<BR>
doesn't<BR>
&gt; have much to say about IBS.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; My stools appear normal, but I often have a lot of gas with sharp pains<BR>
and<BR>
&gt; pass large amounts of clear or white mucus, like egg whites.  Sometimes<BR>
there<BR>
&gt; is blood in the mucus.  I only experience diarrhea on the first day of my<BR>
&gt; period.    I also feel extremely fatigued during flare-ups.  I have a<BR>
feeling<BR>
&gt; that something more serious than IBS is going on.  The symptoms are<BR>
definitely<BR>
&gt; getting in the way of work and school.  I'm pretty happy with my life<BR>
&gt; otherwise, so I don't think stress is a factor.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I'm going to the doctor on Friday and am wondering what to say or<BR>
questions to<BR>
&gt; ask to get something out of the visit--besides advice on cutting out the<BR>
&gt; coffee (which I can give myself).  The doctor recommended the Gottshall<BR>
diet<BR>
&gt; but then said I could introduce some whole grains and other food to test<BR>
my<BR>
&gt; tolerance.  I think she would not have advised this if she thought I had<BR>
an<BR>
&gt; inflammatory condition.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Any advice on sorting through this and getting the best information or<BR>
&gt; treatment?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Thanks<BR>

she has no problem with dairy products (skim milk, cheese, yogurt, ...) ?<BR>
Can anyone explain this ?  Does the book state for &quot;most&quot; blood type O<BR>

                   Sure it is very possible, my sister -inlaw just called<BR>
me two weeks ago all excited that maybe she found a cure for me. ( I'm<BR>
the<BR>
one with Behcets ) She ran into a friend who had been sick for years and<BR>
this women  found a doctor that put her on a diet similar to the SCD but<BR>
she is very allergic to mold spores. She only eats meat without<BR>
additives,<BR>
she cannot leave fruit or vegetables out on the counter for even a short<BR>
while , ( since the doctor told her it develops spores in a very short<BR>
time. Well long story short , the regime this lady followed fixed all<BR>
that<BR>
ails her.<BR>
        I wish it was so simple for myself, this diet has greatly helped<BR>
my<BR>
colon.Now I need to find cures for the other parts of me that ail.<BR>
         My first flare of Behcets was at age 18 to 19 and a half , I am<BR>

Funny thing is that I went into a  controllable phase all the way up to<BR>

SCD.<BR>
        Sadly my hunt for a total cure is still on as I have neuro<BR>
involvement, if<BR>
I could beat these headaches I would be singing from the hill tops. Also<BR>
I<BR>
have a lot of muscle degeneration.<BR>
        A while back someone wrote about what Behcets is  it was a very<BR>
misleading<BR>
and limited description. Here is my description of what Behcets is<BR>
although<BR>
I will miss many symptoms , I think all will get the idea. I will list<BR>
the<BR>
ones that seem to be shared by almost all in our Behcet's group. Plus<BR>
some<BR>
shared by luckily a few ( Blindness)<BR>
                                           Mouth and genital cankers (<BR>
Mouth more frequent)<BR>
                                            Arthritis          ( unlike<BR>
what was written it does not take a<BR>
                                                                      long<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
time to develop , especially when aided<BR>
                                                                       by<BR>
large doses of pred. )<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                               Involvement of the entire digestive tract.<BR>
from the mouth right down to the rectum and vagina, Often mis diagnosed<BR>
as<BR>
CD or UC. This also includes the sinuses.       ( this along with head<BR>
trouble was my first symptom bad enough to complain about)<BR>
                                 Neuro involvement     Migraines ,<BR>
peripheral neuropathy  over ninety percent of the people in our behcets<BR>
group which numbers 150 have a big problem with head troubles. MRI's show<BR>
white patches on the brain from the headaches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                           Skin rashes and photo sensitivity .<BR>
                           Only 25 % of United states patients respond to<BR>
the pin prick test.<BR>
                             Blindness , luckily in the US this also runs<BR>
at a low percent.<BR>
                              Fatigue and muscle degeneration<BR>
                             It can also attack the organ of it's choice<BR>
        Now here is an interesting tidbit Behcets people all seem to gain<BR>
weight<BR>
in large amounts when put on steroids. All the people I know with CD<BR>
still<BR>
seem to lose even when on large doses. So if you gain while on them think<BR>
about Behcets. ( That is only my personal observation)<BR>
                           I try very hard to get people on our Behcets<BR>
list  to try the Scd or variations of it . I would say the ten of us on<BR>
the<BR>
list that use alternative methods and special diets are in the best<BR>
shape.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        Now here is what really bugged me on the post someone else wrote<BR>
about<BR>
Behcets that it seems to run in ten year cycles. WRONG !!!!! Many in our<BR>
group have been suffering for 20 , 30 and even more years.  We have quite<BR>
a<BR>
few teens with it also. Even some babies, it can strike a person at ANY<BR>
AGE.<BR>
        I have not covered all the symptoms but I hope it will give all<BR>
of<BR>
you a<BR>
bit of a clearer picture of just what Behcets is.<BR>
         I am so happy that you have found relief Arlene , I would<BR>
suggest if<BR>
you<BR>
think mold is a big problem for you that you keep your fruit and veggies<BR>
in<BR>
the fridge and scrub them just before eating. I hope you still limit your<BR>
bread and other carbo intake. I lent my SCd diet book to a women in<BR>
England<BR>
, but when I get it back I would gladly mail it to you.<BR>
                                                       Take Care,<BR>
                                                                     Kay<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; i wonder, i just wonder....the other house had a terrible moisture<BR>
&gt; problem....i had<BR>
&gt; mold and mildew climbing up the walls in the bedroom and there was NOWAY<BR>
&gt; to get rid of it...i tried for 3 years...this new house is<BR>
&gt; dry...totally..with lots of sunlight<BR>
&gt; so that the mold and mildew won't even make an appearance.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; is it possible that my body was reacting to the 'spores' in the air???and<BR>
&gt; that's what<BR>
&gt; was causing an auto-immune response?? could it possibly be so??<BR>

<BR>
Greetings!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is great to see things back on line again and that we are getting a free<BR>
flow of information. There is such great assistance knowing that people are<BR>
not alone with this disease....<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, I am troubled by the tenor that the SCD Support Group is taking.<BR>
Not that long ago someone (I forget who) set out some simple guidelines,<BR>
etiquette and rules of the road for our use of this group.  Recently, there<BR>
seems to be an influx of em's dealing with other books, diets, regimens,<BR>
mindsets, &quot;occurances&quot; and paradigms.  All these (as open minded individuals<BR>
taking charge of their illnesses)  have their place and time.  I understood<BR>
that this support group was for those on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet as<BR>
oultined in E.Gottshall's Book(s) &quot;Breaking The Viscous Cycle&quot; /&quot;Eating<BR>
Right for A Bad Gut&quot;.  We value the comments of those who have been strict<BR>
on the diet (no rice milks, soy milks, corn, corn syrup,etc) as this diet<BR>
works at the molecular level and is not a diet that one can occasionally<BR>
&quot;cheat on&quot; like some diets.   Also there has been a plethora of comments on<BR>
other diets that actually include forbidden foods under the SCD, no wonder<BR>
some are asking if certain foods are acceptable, the SCD is at risk of<BR>
becoming marginalized if we keep including other non SCD diets in our<BR>
discussions.  If it is our personal belief then we are entitled to it<BR>
otherwise it has no place in this forum which deals with those on the SCD.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is it that many on the group do not have the book or access to it?  It is<BR>
quite clear what is acceptable and what is not. After reading it several<BR>
times (I make a point to read the first 60 pages every six months or so) I<BR>
find it well written and easy to follow.  The recipies serve to put into<BR>
practice what is covered in the diet.   The comments from ones who have<BR>
worked to modify and improve the diets recipies are invaluable to us as a<BR>
family as we all enjoy the same food as our daughter (5 years with Crohns<BR>
Disease of the colon).  This is a positive side to the group.  We have<BR>
enjoyed the comments of those who have put up with so much and have come out<BR>
winners after their colonoscopies, this gives us and others the<BR>
encouragement to continue.  Discussion about medication, flares and well<BR>
being are also insightful and appreciated as the diet is an adjunct to<BR>
medication. The &quot;hang in there&quot; and &quot;This too shall pass&quot; emails kept us<BR>
going through some dark days and nights.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should this group become a personal forum to promote personal ideas that are<BR>
somewhat tangential to the diet?  - do not get me wrong, I am not trying to<BR>
stiffle public debate and commentary but I wonder what is served by<BR>
discussion about yougurt and blood groups - is this a substantiated study<BR>
that we can all access or is it again a commentary??.  My experience is that<BR>
IBD sufferers are a unique group among those with chronic illness and often<BR>
these tangential emails serve only to bewilder and set them of on a tangent<BR>
perhaps only to undo what has taken weeks with small gains to achieve.<BR>
Incidentally,  we have been with the diet for close to two years, my wife is<BR>
Type &quot;O&quot;, I am Type &quot;AB&quot; and my daughter is type &quot;A&quot; we all enjoy and<BR>
tolerate yougurt.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
 We should count the cost of our comments before sending them out - ask<BR>
ourselves, is this really encouraging?  will it value the other SCDer's? is<BR>
it substantiated and can I refer direct to a specific document? Do we have<BR>
our facts/quotes correct?.  On the point of the yougurt/blood issue what<BR>
happens if someone thinks that yougurt is causing them a problem and they<BR>
stop taking it.  If we are strict to the diet yougurt is fundemental to it.<BR>
If made correctly it will be tolerated by most people.  Further, we should<BR>
be careful about exclusions.  The book when read c a r e f u l l y and<BR>
repeatedly yeilds greater insight.  On exclusions after discussing the diet<BR>
in depth the book states:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
        &quot;The Specific Carbohydrate Diet is highly nutritious and, depending<BR>
        choice of the foods, is well balanced.  Every effort should be made to<BR>
        &quot;round out&quot; the diet by eating sensibly and not, for example consuming<BR>
        large quantities of meat, or more than four muffins each day TO THE<BR>
        EXCLUSION OF OTHER FOODS&quot;  (Page 46, Par 1)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I myself do not want to discourage but I hope that we can move away from the<BR>
current trend.  If I am wrong in my perception, I will stand corrected.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Respectfully submitted,<BR>

Hi people:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am new to the list and have been reading your correspondence with great<BR>
interest. I have an undiagnosed digestive problem which has responded<BR>
well to the scd. I came to the diet naturally, simply by eliminating<BR>
things which bothered me. By &quot;bothered&quot; I mean they caused extreme<BR>
fatigue and an unusual cardiac response. At first I would awaken at night<BR>
after a few minutes of sleep with my heart racing, later on the rapid<BR>
heart beat would occur anytime I ate certain complex carbs. I eliminated<BR>
all grains and dairy, except for cheese and certain other vegies. I had<BR>
diarrhea only when I consumed dairy products. My other main symptom is<BR>
dehydration which, I have discovered, was partly responsible for the fatigue.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I like the scd, I feel alive when I follow it faithfully and do no<BR>
physical work. However, I live on a small homestead and there is alot of<BR>
physical labour involved in this lifestyle, and the scd just can't<BR>
generate the amount of energy I need. I was ok until I foolishly<BR>
submitted to a lactose intolerance test. The results did not show a<BR>
classic intolerance, but I haven't been able to eat cheese since - which<BR>
was, I guess, my major source of fuel (I ate gobs of it everyday when<BR>
active). So now, when I attempt to put in even a half day of work, I get<BR>
so played out that I can't move for a couple of days.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have had no results from the medical profession and am floundering for<BR>
some answers. I've been tested for a wide variety of things, with no<BR>
enlightening results. And I am afraid, after the lactose test, to submit<BR>
to any invasive testing. I am hoping that there is someone on this list<BR>
who has symptoms similar to mine - I don't really fit the scd profile -<BR>
or perhaps I just halted the progression of a bowel disease by going on<BR>
the diet in its early stages. Any help will be greatly appreciated.<BR>

Hi All<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There is another message that talks about some messages that depart a<BR>
bit from the SCD topic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Elaine Gottschall got the diet information from Dr. Haas who developed<BR>
the diet in the late 1940's.  In her talks, she adamantly says that she<BR>
will not change even one word of what Dr. Haas told her.  It is much<BR>
like wanting to change a piece of music by Mozart or adjusting the<BR>
wording of a play by Shakespeare.  Elaine considers Dr. Haas to be a<BR>
master.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is not understood why the diet works.  Elaine has spent many years<BR>
trying to understand it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I personally have used a rotation diet plan to overcome Crohn's disease<BR>
(before Elaine's fisrt book was published). I don't talk about that<BR>
approach much as I have found through personal experience with our local<BR>
support group that people are much more receptive to the SCD method.<BR>
The rotation plans can help some but they are of little value if not<BR>
used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In more than 5 years I was unable to convince even 1 person to try a<BR>
rotation plan.  After that futile effort, I now have several success<BR>
stories locally using the SCD.  The problem we have in our local support<BR>
group is that once the people get better they no longer need the support<BR>
and they stop attending the meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In summary, I believe that the SCD is the best diet approach available.<BR>
Since I work with Elaine Gottschall I have committed to her to follow<BR>
her wishes at all times.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John<BR>

&gt;         Is there corn syrup in plain store bought yogurt? Hmmm.<BR>
&gt;         Ihave a comment about interacting on the list. I don't inderstand why it<BR>
&gt; is necessary to reprint the whole context of a message to respond to it. I<BR>
&gt; find it a bit boring to have to scroll through a long message that I have<BR>
&gt; already read just to see someone else's reply. I think the dialog is such<BR>
&gt; that it is unnecessary . I'm sorry if this seems petty, but if I make a<BR>
&gt; point and someone responds, I don't need to read my whole message again. If<BR>
&gt; someone in tuning in and misses a point, they may not have read old mail.<BR>
&gt; Just wanted to get that out .maybe it's what happens when a person hits<BR>
&gt; &quot;reply to&quot; instead of just sending a new message?<BR>
&gt;                                 seeya...bill<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Personally I prefer replies with messages intact. Why?  Because I save<BR>
most of the messages I get from the SCD list, however I don't need to<BR>
save the original message since it is included in a reply from someone<BR>
else (I save this message only).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And sometimes it's just not possible to follow (ie: read) the list all<BR>
the time.  Our health is and should be be a major priority in our lives,<BR>
however life goes on...<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

<BR>
Hello folks:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Re:  Allan Partridge's discussion &quot;ARE WE FOCUSED?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I have strong feelings about this.  Here's my story:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
1.  I only started using the Internet in the last 6 months because I was<BR>
very concerned about my adult son, who had been diagnosed with CD in June<BR>
96.  My daughter used the net and pointed out the information from the<BR>
Crohn's Colitis foundation.  ONLY an emergency would have driven me to<BR>
using this medium.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2.  I threw my hat in the ring on the IBD list after reading no more than 2<BR>
or 3 posts.  I spoke from the heart without editing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3.  I pissed several people off, who wrote me rude messages, both publicly<BR>
to the list and privately.  (What principally irked people was I wasn't a<BR>
sufferer and yet immediately thought of gathering up all the lore from the<BR>
Internet and putting it in some other--printed--form.  I just thought the<BR>
Internet was as arcane to others as it had been to me.  I DIDN'T THINK).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
4.  These flames were more devastating to me than I could possibly have guessed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
5.  As soon as I found out about the Gottshall book I bought it and read it<BR>
and sent one to my son (who lives in Sweden; Nothern Sweden has an IBD rate<BR>
10 times the rest of the industrialized world.  Hmmm.  NO sun, NO veggies,<BR>
lots of dairy, sugar, and refined flour.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
6.  He so far has not decided to use it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
7.  I am trying the diet (have just over 30 days) to see how much trouble<BR>
it is and what the affect is on a person not suffering from IBD.  (I'm<BR>
constipated and have lost 8 pounds.  Lutz talks about the constipating<BR>
effect).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
8.  I'm reading textbooks, the Internet, the IBD list, the scd list.  I<BR>
like you folks the best.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
9.  Earlier, I would not have agreed with Allan's point about focusing the<BR>
discussion, since I so needed people to talk to.  Even though some people<BR>
flamed me, a few responded to the anguish they heard under the whining, and<BR>
I have several penpals.  I can talk to them at length and about anything.<BR>
SO NOW I'm ready to focus (present post excepted) with some caveats.<BR>
(Caveat:  a legal notice . . .to suspend a certain proceeding until the<BR>
notifier is given a hearing.  I think there will always be times when<BR>
comments like Allan's are sorely needed to get a HEARING from everybody in<BR>
the group and see we're still on the same sheet of music).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
10. Back to focusing the discussion on scd list.  I have hard copies of<BR>
ALMOST ALL the posts from the scd list from the last 3 months in 3-ring<BR>
binders.  (I have the IBD list on paper back to when it started).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
11.  NOW  I can see why the protocol for one-short-message-per-post makes<BR>
sense.  I have made a filing system for the scd list based on SUBJECT.  I<BR>
have files on IBD Theory, Personal Testimony, Recipes, Yogurt, Vitamins,<BR>
Alt. Therapy, Other diets, Research, Medication, Surgery, Immune System,<BR>
Experts--and the categories are still proliferating.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I read a post and don't know where to put it.  Paper piles up.  I see a<BR>
pattern then lose it.  I want to be able to succinctly report to my son and<BR>
instead end up copying stuff and sending it to him, thus defeating the<BR>
purpose of all the hours I've spent in trying to cut the wheat from the<BR>
chaff.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
12.  CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We forget very quickly what it was like to be newly diagnosed or to be the<BR>
parent of spouse or other love one of someone diagnosed.  You can't believe<BR>
how both humbled and toughened up I am since the first shock of reading<BR>
medical textbooks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IMHO (snicker, snicker, see what I've picked up, and if you don't know what<BR>
it means e-mail me directly.  I'm using it to prove I just didn't get off<BR>
the last boat, as my immigrant Grandmother used to say.)  People can be<BR>
told how a culture, such as the Internet/scd list, works, and then gently<BR>
be led to adopt its ways.  For the most part, they don't need to have their<BR>
feet held to the flames.  Or insiders can just be patient until newcomers<BR>
pick it up.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I don't remember ever seeing any info on how the scd list operates.<BR>
Obviously, it's a unique culture, quite different from the IBD list or the<BR>
Crohn's Colitis foundation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I was never TOLD about a one message per post rule; I finally inferred it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'd like to know when it's OK and not rude to respond just to the person<BR>
sending the message and not the whole group.(I think that would be one way<BR>
to keep tedious conversations some of us want to have on other topics from<BR>
intruding on the whole group, but it's always a judgment call.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EVEN MORE CONCLUSIVE CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The question seems to be:  which way are we going to err--towards the<BR>
INclusive or the EXclusive?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'll play either way once I know the rules.  While I'm learning, I<BR>
appreciate it when people tell me how to act along with assuring me that<BR>
everybody had to learn.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PLEEASE forgive me for such a long message.  I value each and every one of<BR>
you on this list, you're an inspiration.  Like Dietmar, I'm a recovering<BR>
intellectual.  Life dishes out experiences the mind can't handle alone.<BR>
Besides suffering from intestinal problems, you guys are wonderful and<BR>
brave and smart and funny--and so am I, and that's why I belong here.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Dear Penny,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I wanted to address one of the issues you mentioned in your post, namely<BR>
that it can be hard to get calories.  I've been on a very strict diet<BR>
lately since I've been trying to weed out some food<BR>
allergies/intolerances. I tell ya, finding some foods that don't upset<BR>
me and just eating them all the time makes a world of psychological<BR>
difference.  So I can understand how hard it is giving up cheese when<BR>
you've been using it a lot.  I'll tell you what my mainstays are:<BR>
chicken, cauliflower, canola oil spritzed on instead of butter, avocado<BR>
(great source of fat and calories), and lately I've been able to add<BR>
acorn squash, cantelope and watermelon.  I look forward to being able to<BR>
add more foods, but for now, just knowing I have stuff i can eat that<BR>
will give me fuel, makes a big difference.  Also make sure to drink<BR>
plenty of water, that can be a source of fatigue as well.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

&gt; Hi people:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I am new to the list and have been reading your correspondence with great<BR>
&gt; interest. I have an undiagnosed digestive problem which has responded<BR>
&gt; well to the scd. I came to the diet naturally, simply by eliminating<BR>
&gt; things which bothered me. By &quot;bothered&quot; I mean they caused extreme<BR>
&gt; fatigue and an unusual cardiac response. At first I would awaken at night<BR>
&gt; after a few minutes of sleep with my heart racing, later on the rapid<BR>
&gt; heart beat would occur anytime I ate certain complex carbs. I eliminated<BR>
&gt; all grains and dairy, except for cheese and certain other vegies. I had<BR>
&gt; diarrhea only when I consumed dairy products. My other main symptom is<BR>
&gt; dehydration which, I have discovered, was partly responsible for the fatigue.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I like the scd, I feel alive when I follow it faithfully and do no<BR>
&gt; physical work. However, I live on a small homestead and there is alot of<BR>
&gt; physical labour involved in this lifestyle, and the scd just can't<BR>
&gt; generate the amount of energy I need. I was ok until I foolishly<BR>
&gt; submitted to a lactose intolerance test. The results did not show a<BR>
&gt; classic intolerance, but I haven't been able to eat cheese since - which<BR>
&gt; was, I guess, my major source of fuel (I ate gobs of it everyday when<BR>
&gt; active). So now, when I attempt to put in even a half day of work, I get<BR>
&gt; so played out that I can't move for a couple of days.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I have had no results from the medical profession and am floundering for<BR>
&gt; some answers. I've been tested for a wide variety of things, with no<BR>
&gt; enlightening results. And I am afraid, after the lactose test, to submit<BR>
&gt; to any invasive testing. I am hoping that there is someone on this list<BR>
&gt; who has symptoms similar to mine - I don't really fit the scd profile -<BR>
&gt; or perhaps I just halted the progression of a bowel disease by going on<BR>
&gt; the diet in its early stages. Any help will be greatly appreciated.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Penny<BR>
