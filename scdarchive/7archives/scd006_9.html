<P><B>Diet success question</B><BR>
Thu, 26 Dec 1996 13:35:11<BR>
<BR>
Hi Everyone<BR>
<BR>
I am interested in some opinions from the group. I have just spent two weeks
in the <BR>
hospital separated by a week at home where I just got sicker with the worst
and most <BR>
resistant flare up of UC ever. I got out for Christmas day but have to go
back because <BR>
I am still on iv prednisone. The first time when they let me go I seemed
to <BR>
deteriorate on the oral prednisone. I am at the point of surgery (doctor's
opinion not <BR>
mine) or something like imuran. I am planning to see a Dr. Hanauer in Chicago
for a <BR>
second opinion before making any decisions since I seem to be out of any
kind of <BR>
emergency situation and have some time to decide.<BR>
<BR>
My question is regarding the diet. It is very difficult to stop the one
thing which <BR>
you have a little control over however for a year I have had really no success
and very <BR>
little time off prednisone. I adhered to the diet strictly but I am beginning
to feel <BR>
that whatever relief I did see was strictly medication. I've never seen
any connection <BR>
with symptoms returning those times when I did have something not allowed.
What do you <BR>
think about this diet in the case where it doesn't seem to be helping. How
does it fit <BR>
in with all the theories? Do you think that some people are just too sick
for the diet <BR>
to give a turn around?<BR>
<BR>
I'm sorry I can't be one of the people who offers a great success story,
I sure wish I <BR>
was. And I hope this won't be discouraging for anyone else trying the diet
out. <BR>
Hopefully I'm an outlier in the statistics.<BR>
<BR>
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and Good Health to Everyone<BR>

<BR>
<B>Christine,</B><BR>
<BR>
Believe me, I know exactly how you feel. My doctor, a crohn's specialist,<BR>
has about 300 patients. He has told me that I am his biggest challenge.
<BR>
My last doctor just gave up on me and I quit seeing him! But now, any new<BR>
medications or new treatments, I am always the first to try them out.<BR>
<BR>
I tried the SC diet over a year ago and it never worked for me. I was part<BR>
of an earlier email support group and I would hear all these wonderful<BR>
success stories while I was going nowhere on the diet. So I quit trying<BR>
the diet.<BR>
<BR>
About 4 months ago, I decided to give the diet another try. And although
I<BR>
still am not seeing miraculous success with it like some people, I am<BR>
seeing a little bit of progress. Its very hard for me to follow the diet<BR>
around the holidays, but I am not going to get discouraged because I've<BR>
slipped a few times. I am still going to stay on the diet into the new<BR>
year, and hopefully I will start to see some more progress again.<BR>
<BR>
Now I know that you have UC and I have crohn's, but you should hang in<BR>
there and keep trying the SC diet. Stay with this group, they will give<BR>
you a lot of good info and encouragement. Have a healthy and happy `97!

<B>If Diet Doesn't Work</B><BR>
Thu, 26 Dec 1996 19:34:45 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Season's Greetings to everyone. I've just joined this group. My name is
Lisa<BR>
and I have a 3 1/2 year old son who is on the scd diet. <BR>
<BR>
I see there are some messages from folks who are not getting any results
from<BR>
being on the diet. I was diagnosed with Crohn's about 30 years ago. I no<BR>
longer have any problems as long as I follow the diet that allows foods
that<BR>
&quot;I&quot; react to. The reason I put I in quotes is that everyone has
to find the<BR>
foods that they themselves do well with. If you are sensitive to the casein<BR>
in milk, as my son is, you will not do well as long as you continue to ingest<BR>
the cheese. <BR>
<BR>
Also, a large part of digestive problems have to do with undiagnosed<BR>
parasites. If you haven't had a parasitology test done by a lab that<BR>
SPECIALIZES in parasites, you will not see results with the diet until the<BR>
parasites are dealt with. Even though I live in Georgia, I took my son to<BR>
see Dr. Leo Galland in New York City so I could get him rid of these<BR>
digestive problems. <BR>

Hi Christine,<BR>
Thu, 26 Dec 1996 20:40:00<BR>
<BR>
I can't offer you any answers to your questions but feel empathy towards<BR>
your frustrations. One phrase from your letter &quot; It is very difficult
to<BR>
stop the one thing which <BR>
&gt;you have a little control&quot; stays in my mind. If this diet gives
you a<BR>
sense of some control then it could be worth continuing, at least that way<BR>
you feel you're doing what you can for your self. The diet helps me a lot<BR>
but has not completely controlled my symptoms. I'm convinced now that it<BR>
never will but it has given my some measure of control and hope which I
find<BR>
now I can't abandon. I think that IBDs have many different underlying<BR>
causes and perhaps this is the reason that the diet doesn't work for all.<BR>
Our thoughts will be with you as you return to hospital to face some<BR>
difficult choices.<BR>
<BR>
Good health<BR>

Dear Christine, <BR>
I read your letter this morning and haven't been able to get<BR>
you out of my mind all day. I'm so sorry that the diet isn't the miracle<BR>
for you that it is for me and so many others. Maybe as Jim says, the diet<BR>
can work for you at another time. I'm glad that you are taking measures
not<BR>
to jump into surgery. You might consider a heart to heart chat with Elaine.<BR>
Her phone number is in the back of the book and she really tries to help.<BR>
She may have some ideas you hadn't considered. My thoughts and prayers are<BR>
with you.<BR>

<P>Thu, 26 Dec 1996 23:53:48<BR>
<BR>
<B>Christine, </B><BR>
Sorry to here about your problems. Have you been checked <BR>
for pathogenic bacteria and other parasites? I have been sending <BR>
stool samples to the Great Smokies Diagnostic Lab and they found an <BR>
offensive bacteria that I was able to get rid of. You can find more <BR>
about this lab by doing a search on the WWW.<BR>
<BR>
In terms of diet, Have you considered an elimination diet that would <BR>
still be compatable with the SCD? This is how it works. You stop all <BR>
solid food for a couple of weeks then start solids by eating only one <BR>
SCD approved item and wait a few days before adding another food type. <BR>
This would allow you to find out if certain SCD foods are causing any <BR>
problems. Let me know if you need any info on liquid diets that are <BR>
available (TPN is another option for getting started).<BR>
<BR>
If you do need surgery, I may be worth checking into laparoscopic <BR>
surgery rather than conventional surgery. I had 11 inches of gut <BR>
removed laparoscopically and it reduced my recovery time by a factor <BR>
of three. I was back at work part-time 9 days after the surgery. I can <BR>
also give you more info on this if you wish.<BR>
<BR>
You are in my thoughts and I hope you recover soon. Please let me know <BR>
if there is anything I can do. <BR>

<P><B>SCD: Digestive enzymes and butyrate enemas?</B><BR>
Fri, 27 Dec 1996 3:06:58<BR>
<BR>
Has anyone found the following to be of benefit?<BR>
<BR>
Therapeutic doses of digestive enzymes, particularly the vegetable derived<BR>
ones (the other major type comes from pancreases of cows or pigs). The<BR>
amylase will help digest extra carbohydrates, the lipase to break down the<BR>
fats, the protease to break down the protein (will sometimes help heal open<BR>
sores, but might burn), the lactase for the milk sugar, the cellulase to<BR>
digest the plant cellulose (effective against Candida yeast, a plant) and<BR>
then there is maltase and some other enzymes to break down the complex<BR>
carbohydrates. The benefit of the vegetable based ones is that they can
work<BR>
in the upper part of the stomach (which is acidic) as well as in the small<BR>
intestines. Extra enzymes are absorbed into the bloodstream where they can<BR>
continue to work. Amalyse, for instance, can help break up mucus (emphysema<BR>
and asthma possibilities).<BR>
<BR>
Also, a naturopath told me about butyrate...buturic acid (given as a salt,<BR>
he said) retention enemas. He said they were very effective for lesion-type<BR>
diseases of the colon. For more information about the enemas, your health<BR>
care practitioner can call Tyler Encapsulation, 800-869-9705, to request<BR>
product outline and copies of studies.<BR>

I found both butyrate and the vegetarian digestive enzymes to be <BR>
absolutely worthless for my UC and related digestive problems.<BR>

The question posed on the net was<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Does anyone know about a recent review on antibiotic-associated diarrhea
?<BR>
<BR>
I am particularly interested in frequency, severity, specially as regards<BR>
pseudo-membranous colitis, and also specially with cephalosporins.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance to whoever can help!&quot;<BR>

<P>&gt;<B>Hi all!,</B><BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks for all the replies re: Gaining Weight.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;One more question; Does anybody have any good recepies for breakfast
meals?<BR>
&gt;I'm sort of getting tired of having eggs every morining... :]<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks!<BR>
&gt;Don.<BR>
<BR>
Stewed fruits my mainstay to start with then as the diarrhea settles down
- fresh fruit, if it still has active enzymes, otherwise stick to stewed
fruit. cook it in the evening so you have some thing to wake up to and you
can even try some of the deserts on hand. I splurged and had a big slice
of banana cake, a small slice of cheesecake, 2 stewed apples, 1 stewed peach
and some home made yoghurt for breakfast today. That was interesting and
very yummy and with heaps of useable calories.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Some simple things that have helped me, and SCD</B><BR>
Sunday, 29 Dec 1996 23:35:54 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hello, <BR>
<BR>
Here are some thoughts on recent messages, as well as a few simple ideas
<BR>
that I posetd to alt.support.crohns-colitis. Any opinions?<BR>
<BR>
- weight loss and SCD - my weight loss stabilized when I started regularly<BR>
baking with nut flour, AND regularly eating the dry curd cottage cheese.
I<BR>
especially like the muffins and carrot cake. Also, for additional<BR>
calories, try making your own guacamole from fresh avocados, tomatoes,<BR>
lemon juice, garlic, etc. You can use it as a dip for vegetables, or on<BR>
top of chicken or tuna with cheese.<BR>
<BR>
- &quot;Eating Right for a Bad Gut&quot; book by Scala - I got this book
by James<BR>
Scala after it was recommended on the crohns-colitis newsgroup. It<BR>
doesn't offer any earth-shattering news, and much of it is at odds with
the<BR>
SCD. But, I found its explanation of vitamin and mineral supplement issues<BR>
very well done, and I've been following some of its suggestions with good<BR>
results, especially for the SCD. More ideas from this book follow....<BR>
<BR>
- Scala's book, SCD and beet juice - one thing that Scala does is<BR>
informally survey a small set of IBD patients to determine what foods seem<BR>
to exacerbate or induce flare-ups. I was very interested to learn that<BR>
many of his subjects blamed beets or beet juice for causing flares. Beet<BR>
juice is one of the ingredients of V8 juice, one of the two canned juices<BR>
recommended by Gottschall in the SCD. When I started the SCD, I had<BR>
relied heavily on V8 juice because its delicious, nutritious, and you can<BR>
find it in most restaurants.<BR>
But I soon became convinced that it made me feel terrible, so I cut it out.<BR>
Then I read Scala's book and found that others had the same problem. <BR>
Is it possible that some people's bad experiences with the SCD are due to<BR>
drinking a lot of V8?<BR>
<BR>
- peeling fruits and vegetables - Scala also urges peeling all fruits and<BR>
vegetables before eating. I believe this has helped me, and I eat a LOT
of<BR>
fuits and vegetables on this diet.<BR>
<BR>
The following is what I posted to alt.support.crohns-colitis:<BR>
<BR>
First of all, my case is not yet clearly diagnosed, but acc. to the doctor,<BR>
it &quot;could be either colitis, UC, or non-specific colitis.&quot; Also,
I have<BR>
fairly moderate symptoms, though they've been persistent over the past few<BR>
months. I'm on Sulfasalazine, and trying the SCD diet. The Sulfasalazine<BR>
definitely helps, though I think it causes some mild but annoying<BR>
side-effects like fatigue and irritability. The SCD diet seems to be<BR>
helping, too, but I'm still not sure.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond the obvious drugs, and various diet ideas, I've found the following<BR>
simple things seem to help a lot:<BR>
<BR>
- garlic oil pills - they may not help everyone, and they may irritate some<BR>
people, but I've found that they definitely calm my abdominal discomfort,<BR>
reduce BM frequency, and firm up stools. I'm taking one or two 3-mg<BR>
softgels a day (Safeway brand).<BR>
<BR>
- fish oil pills - they seem to help in the same way as the garlic. I'm<BR>
taking 3 1000 mg capsules each day with meals. The Brand is Good Nature<BR>
&quot;MaxEPA&quot; with EPA and DHA.<BR>
<BR>
- tea instead of coffee - it was hard, but I've cut coffee out entirely
in<BR>
favor of tea. Just switching from coffee to tea (real tea with caffeine)<BR>
seems to have alleviated some symptoms. Someday I'll try to cut out the<BR>
tea, but, hey, I'm human. <BR>
<BR>
- sleep - the more I sleep, the less symptoms I have. I guess that ties<BR>
in with stress, too.<BR>
<BR>
- peeling vegetables and fruit before eating. This is suggested in the<BR>
book &quot;Eating Right for a Bad Gut&quot;, by Dr. James Scala (ISBN 0-452-26766-8).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These ideas aren't much, but maybe they can help someone. And I'd rather<BR>
eat garlic and fish oil than more drugs.<BR>
