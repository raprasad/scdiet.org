To all of the SCD subscribers:<BR>
<BR>
I am Jennifer King and I am a 3rd grade teacher in Missouri.  I have<BR>
Irritible Bowel Syndrome and have been diagnosed for 7 years.  I found<BR>
Elaine's diet by talking with a friend whose mother was on the diet.  I<BR>
used to spend all day in the bathroom as many of you have, but my job<BR>
does not facilitate such an inconvenience.  Every time I ran to the<BR>
bathroom, I basically risked a lawsuit leaving my students alone! <BR>
Anyway, July 1, 1998 will be my one year anniversary on the diet.  I<BR>
have followed it faithfully and my life has changed for the better. I am<BR>
a nice jovial human being again!  <BR>
<BR>
I vowed that I would not do anything to change my diet during the school<BR>
year, but now that summer is here I have made a few changes and I have<BR>
not felt the same since.  I added bread back into my diet and at first<BR>
it was great.  It was sinfully great.  But I have overdone it a bit and<BR>
I need to get back to the basics.<BR>
<BR>
I am currently taking Elavil (anti-depressant to work as an<BR>
anti-spasmotic), Paxil (anxiety), and Prilosec (for gas.)  Does anyone<BR>
out there take any of these medicines as well as follow the diet?  If<BR>
so, I would like to hear from you.  I am having trouble getting<BR>
motivated to go back to the diet in full force. It is hard once you have<BR>
splurged a bit.  I am so proud of myself for being 100% faithful for 10<BR>
months and if you have experienced what I am going through, I would love<BR>
to hear from you as well.<BR>
<BR>
One more thing, I have been experiencing panic attacks for the past year<BR>
and a half and I have read about the bowel-brain connection.  I was<BR>
wondering if anyone else could shed the light in this area.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks so much,<BR>
Jennifer King<BR>

Well, we didn't write down the exact date or anything like that, but Matt<BR>
has been on the diet for a year this month. Things are going really well.<BR>
Even his respiratory problems, which started at the same time as all his<BR>
other symptoms, have finally all but gone away. He has gained weight<BR>
consistently during this year. He had lost a considerable amount of weight<BR>
prior to going on the SCD, not a good thing for a twelve year old to be<BR>
doing. At thirteen he is active, gaining weight, and doing all the things<BR>
his friends do except that hanging out at McDonald's is pretty out of the<BR>
questions. Luckily, his friends don't do a lot of that anyway. Thanks to<BR>
everyone who has been of assistance.<BR>

I started the diet 2 1/2 years ago.  I have Colitis. <BR>
I noticed changes in 2 weeks, which were significant. My swelling went down, <BR>
my urgency to go went down. I still had some bleeding, which only fully went <BR>
away for a few 2-3 week periods at a time.  MY spirits went way up.  It was <BR>
quite a while after that before I "found myself" at a higer level of remission, it <BR>
is a slow, slow process. I feel that it took "resigning myself" to being on the diet <BR>
for psychophysiological changes to occur to offset the frustration and <BR>
discouragement of being chronically ill.  I stopped meds after about 6 months on <BR>
the diet.  I should be on asacol, as a day-to-day maintenence drug which is <BR>
supposed to help you stay in remmision, but I think it increases my bleeding. So I <BR>
find that I just stop taking it.<BR>
<BR>
I had achieved a level of remission in March of this year that led me to believe <BR>
that I had "gotten all I was going to get" from the diet.  All the mucus, swelling <BR>
and accompanying urgency to move bowels had disappeared. I had occasinal <BR>
sporadic showings of blood in my stool, but nothing like what I had experienced <BR>
before going on the diet. I had long given up any medication. A happy camper, I <BR>
was.  I started "reintroducing foods."  I figured corn (in the form of tortilla chips <BR>
and my own custom corn bread recipe) and rice, and beer were good starting <BR>
points. Much to my delight, I was able to handle them without any adverse <BR>
symptoms - at first.  I noticed a significant boost in energy, most likely from <BR>
the carbohydrates, and put an extra maybe 7 pounds on, I felt more substantial.  <BR>
Once I started putting ketchup on burger patties, and allowed myself to go out to <BR>
restaurants, the symptoms started creeping back until -- WHAM! I was having a <BR>
relapse! Now, 3 weeks later, on 15 mg of prednisone and back on the diet "with <BR>
fanatical adherance" I find that I'm coming around again.  I think if I had tread <BR>
more lightly, or waited another 6 months, I would have been less succeptiple to <BR>
having this relapse.  BUT - I've learned now that the diet definitely alleviates <BR>
the most bothersome symptom for me, the constant urge to go. I'm doing rather <BR>
well, I must say. I feel good. But, some of that new-found carbo-induced energy <BR>
is gone (replaced by the racey steroid induced frenzical state that prednisone <BR>
puts me in).  I expect that I'll be able to taper off the prednisne in another couple <BR>
of weeks, thanks to eating only foods legal to the diet. I'm also back to being <BR>
sensitive to stuff like grape skins, which are irritating to my stomach, but I <BR>
don't feel that I'm back to square one by a longshot. If you ar pondering whether <BR>
or not to take the plunge and do the diet, you would be foolish not to give it a <BR>
shot. It must be done with 100% commitment, from my experience. Treat it like a <BR>
religion, and you are the high priest.<BR>

Subject: <B>Flare after 2 & 1/2 years</B><BR>
<BR>
Hi,<BR>
    I've been on the SCD for 2 &1/2 years and I'm experiencing a bad Crohn's<BR>
flare. Several things brought it on. First I had my teeth cleaned - that has<BR>
always given me some trouble, maybe swallowing the plaque that is scraped<BR>
off sets off my immune system. Second during the few days after the teeth<BR>
cleaning, I ate some fresh cherries - only about five or so, but even after<BR>
2 yrs. on SCD I still can't eat fruit. Then a few days later while still not<BR>
feeling so great I ate dinner at a friends house. It was a BBQ, so there<BR>
probably was a little sugar in the BBQ sauce, plus I ate about 1 Tbs. of<BR>
baked beans -also probably had sugar in it. These are very small amounts<BR>
especially for someone on the diet for over 2 years. Well I'm now in 40mg<BR>
prednesone a day for the last 5 days. It has helped, but now I want to taper<BR>
off as fast as possible. I'm wondering what some of you have experienced as<BR>
far as tapering down and how quickly you have done it. of course I'm being<BR>
very strict with diet - only cooked meat and vegetables - not fruit or dairy<BR>
or honey.<BR>
                                Thanks,<BR>

<BR>
I have been on SCD for almost two years:  (1) Acid reflux gone almost <BR>
immediately.  (2) Constipation and D gone after 8 - 9 weeks.  (3) I have <BR>
learned to listen closely to my body.  Lately I have been cheating on <BR>
the diet to see what would happen.  So far, I can sense when the food is <BR>
not agreeing with me (pizza) (chips)etc., and I immediately go back to <BR>
the diet.  It has been a year with no symptoms.  But my body seems to <BR>
say it is not ready yet.  If it means that I will have to eat grilled <BR>
salmon seasoned with Cajun spices, meatloaf made with a combo of turkey, <BR>
pork and beef (lightened with V8), delicious nut muffins and smoothies <BR>
for breakfast, pies made with almond flour crust, lasagna made with <BR>
zucchini  - I think I can enjoy it.  In fact it seems like a very <BR>
healthy life choice to me.<BR>

I went to my doctor today and he released me.  He said I didn't need to<BR>
come back unless I had a problem.  He said I really hadn't had a real<BR>
flare-up for over a year.  I told him that is because I have been on this<BR>
diet for that long.  He still does not think that the diet is what has<BR>
made me feel better.  I am by no means completely cured.  There are some<BR>
days that my side hurts, but it is not bad and does not last.  I was so<BR>
glad to released from the doctor after 4 years.  I am not on any<BR>
medication, but plan on staying on scd for the rest of my life.  I had to<BR>
share this news with those  people who understand how exciting this is . <BR>

Subject: <B>Is this the right diet for me?</B><BR>
<BR>
Dear HLachs@aol.com,<BR>
<BR>
(I didn't get your name).<BR>
<BR>
I had the same problem you do. I was usually constipated and sometimes felt<BR>
as if I had a basketball in my gut, I was that bloated! Off and on this<BR>
would reverse to D, which many times I welcomed as it gave me relief. Just<BR>
before going on the SCD, Sept. 27, 1997, I also began bleeding. Another<BR>
problem was extreme chest pain along with sharp pains around my heart,<BR>
which fortunately ended up to be from my stomach, not my heart. My theory<BR>
on that was that all the stuff sitting in my intestines, due to<BR>
constipation, was causing gas to back up into my stomach.<BR>
<BR>
The SCD has helped me become 'regular', which equates to one good bm in the<BR>
morning. I leave the house for work feeling light and good.  I very rarely<BR>
experience the chest pain or sharp stomach pains now.<BR>
<BR>
I still have to work at it though, because there are certain foods that are<BR>
allowed on the SCD that give me an adverse reaction.  If I have a bad day,<BR>
I can usually track it back to a particular food, usually some type of<BR>
fruit.<BR>
<BR>
I have also cheated on occasion and I can declare without a doubt that<BR>
grains will bring back the constipation immediately and can last for 4-5<BR>
days. So breads, pasta, anything with flour in it is harmful.<BR>
<BR>
My doctor wanted me to also try a diet that would be right for my blood<BR>
type. I have not completely implemented it because combined with the SCD,<BR>
it restricts me even further.  One thing that the blood type diet would<BR>
allow is corn, which the SCD does not. So my doctor said to experiment, one<BR>
food at a time if I want.  Well, I tried corn (I love chips and salsa). I<BR>
do not recall having an immediate gut reaction, i.e. constipation, but it<BR>
did bring back my eczema, which some research has shown, the scaly<BR>
condition of the skin is an outward sign of what is occurring in the<BR>
intestines.<BR>
<BR>
I can summarize all of this by saying, I have tried the SCD, and I have<BR>
tested it with somewhat controlled experiments, and my conclusion is, it<BR>
works!  And it doesn't pay to cheat.  When I started the SCD I hoped it<BR>
would be a temporary thing, maybe 2 or 3 years.  But I have adopted the<BR>
attitude that the SCD is the way for me to eat. Since it has made such a<BR>
difference in my life, I don't look at it as temporary anymore, and I also<BR>
don't see it as restrictive.<BR>
<BR>
I have read that when you continue to eat foods that you are allergic to<BR>
you will gain weight. I had gained an unwanted 25 lbs. I would also notice,<BR>
when I was experiencing bloating, I could gain 5 lbs in one day! I have<BR>
lost that 25 lbs and am back to my  ideal body weight. The daily weight<BR>
fluctuations have diminished as well.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry for making this so long. I hope you try the SCD, and I hope you get<BR>
the same relief that I have. You will want to be fanatic about it,<BR>
especially for the first 4 weeks, to see if it is going to help you.<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
Linda<BR>

Subject: <B>Hello from Northern B.C.</B><BR>
<BR>
This is my first time on the chat site.<BR>
<BR>
I was diagnosed in April with Celiac.  During my first month my Naturopath<BR>
and I added pancreatic enzymes, plantzymes, Bile, HCL and Pepsin, Carbamide.<BR>
I am already taking biotin and folic acid, calcium, magnesium etc. etc.<BR>
Within the first month of gluten free and my new supplements, I felt alot<BR>
better.  <BR>
<BR>
Prior to being diagnosed I lost 20 pounds in 3 months.  I now weigh 98<BR>
pounds and am 5'7".  A little bit slim for my liking!  As well, prior to<BR>
April 5th, I was a vegetarian for 2 years as I thought that I was doing my<BR>
body a favour cutting out the meat.  I had problems digesting it but now as<BR>
I think back it was probably what I ate with it that was causing the<BR>
problem. For my entire life, I have been affected by digestive and<BR>
constipation problems and just sort of learned to live with it as "this is<BR>
me".  My energy levels in March 1998 were so low that I was sleeping most of<BR>
the day and had incredible headaches and stomach aches (especially after<BR>
eating - in the gallbladder area).  I am now a meat & veggie eating-aholic!<BR>
and have never felt better!<BR>
<BR>
On May 25th I dug out my copy of "Food and Gut Reaction" by Elaine<BR>
Gottschall that I had purchased about 5 years ago, read, put away and<BR>
thought that I could never eat like that.  As of that date I have been on<BR>
the SCD.  It was about a month after that and I really started to notice the<BR>
increase in energy. Like wow!  Up to May 25th I was feeling OK but new there<BR>
was still something wrong.<BR>
I like a few others (notes that I have read on the chat line) dove right in<BR>
and was eating nuts etc and salads from day one as I didn't really read the<BR>
instructions properly.  Something else that I notices as I reread the book a<BR>
few days ago was that seeds are not allowed.  I've been eating tahini and<BR>
sunflower seeds quite a bit.  No more now though.  <BR>
I have a few questions that I was hoping for input if possible.  <BR>
<BR>
I still am constipated.   I went to see a different ND who told me that at<BR>
one time in my life, I have had the Epstein Barr Virus (I cann't seem to<BR>
remember having it) and that the symptoms will be low grade for the rest of<BR>
my life.  He said that this causes improper liver function, therefore poor<BR>
elimination as well.  I was unable to take the homeopathic tincture<BR>
(barberry) as it made my feel fatigue and have a horrible headache.  Have<BR>
you heard of this and do you think that it could cause the constipation.  <BR>
<BR>
I still also have an "Oily substance" that I see in the toilet water, when I<BR>
go to the bathroom.  What does this mean.  Could it be from the seeds that I<BR>
have been eating??  Not digesting the fat??<BR>
<BR>
I have not gained any weight back yet and cannot wait to put it back on.  I<BR>
read some of the info about certain veggies (squash, pumpkin, turnip) that<BR>
may do it and I will increase this in my diet  asap.  Any other<BR>
recommendations?  Would eating smaller meals 4 x a day be good?<BR>
<BR>
I was taking a colloidal mineral drink prior to being diagnosed called<BR>
"Longlife Minerals".  It has all 90 colloidal minerals and a few other added<BR>
nutrients such as nopal cactus, 100% soluable fibre.  It is in a base of<BR>
crystalline fructose, potassium gluconate, magnesium gluconate, citric acid,<BR>
malic acid, calcium gluconate, zinc gluconate, potassium benzonate,<BR>
potassium sorbate, copper gluconate etc. etc.  I think the colloids are good<BR>
but the base is not allowed on the SCD.  Therefore, can you recommend a<BR>
product that would give me the collodial minerals.  Do you think they are a<BR>
good thing???<BR>
<BR>
Is gray hair (I am 29) caused by my body being starved of nutrients?  Will<BR>
it turn brown again?<BR>
<BR>
What can you do for a prolapsed bowel??<BR>
<BR>
I also have another bit of information that I would like to share.  I have<BR>
just recently read "Eat Right for your Blood Type", by Peter D'Adamo.  It is<BR>
really an interesting book.  One thing that fascinated my was that I am a<BR>
Type "O" and the diet that he outlines for Type "O"'s is very close to the<BR>
SCD.  I am interested to know how many people there are out there that have<BR>
Celiac etc. are Type "O" people????   The Type "O" is known as the "Meat<BR>
Eater - Hunter Gatherer" and was the first known blood type for prehistoric<BR>
man.  There is a web site about the "Paleolithic Diet" if anyone is<BR>
interested.   On this diet the individual eats only what the Hunter Gatherer<BR>
would have ate back then - meat, veggies, certain legumes, certain nuts, no<BR>
dairy, no grains and no potatoes. The Type "A" came along later when mankind<BR>
began growing food for agricultural purposes.  They Type "A" is the<BR>
vegetarian and can tolerate the grains and dairy but isn't very tolerable<BR>
red meat etc.  <BR>
I apologize for dragging on so long, but I thought is was interesting and<BR>
Food for Thought!!!! Hee Hee <BR>
<BR>
I feel really good, the best in years (have been losing weight for about 4<BR>
years now).  I would like to sincerely thank Elaine Gottschall for writing<BR>
both of her books and giving me a new life.  I also enjoyed the new<BR>
information about Celiac in "Breaking the Viscous Cycle".   I can actually<BR>
think straight again and have colour in my face!  We have been trying for<BR>
children for a few years now and can now hopefully see them in the future<BR>
sometime.  I look forward to helping anyone I can with this information.<BR>
<BR>
I look forward to any of your knowledge when you have a moment!!! <BR>
<BR>
Thank you again!<BR>

Dear Niall,<BR>
<BR>
This diet has been the answer to our prayers of the last three-and-a-half<BR>
years. My son was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at 11. We tried<BR>
alternative therapies ranging from acupuncture to hypnosis, as well as<BR>
prednisone, Asacol, sulfasalazine and cortisone enemas. Nothing made much<BR>
difference. Now, I can happily report that at fourteen, he is doing much<BR>
much better, after only three months on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.<BR>
He has improved tremendously, and his response was startlingly obvious<BR>
within only two days of starting the elimination of certain (most)<BR>
carbohydrates. The book to get is Breaking the Vicious Cycle, by Elaine<BR>
Gottschall, and it will answer all your specific questions. If you don't<BR>
have it yet, be sure to order it from Barnes and Noble. It is a dream<BR>
come true for us.<BR>
<BR>
My heart goes out to you and your family. You need not watch your son<BR>
suffer like this, despite what the doctors say: there is help available.<BR>
And is not difficult to integrate into your lifestyle, so you can now<BR>

miracle. <BR>

I was at my worst, I was diagnosed with Crohn's 7 years ago.  Never had<BR>
surgery<BR>
and was told that I should have due to my blood count and to my massive<BR>
weight loss.  I was on med's like prednisone, asacol, etc. up until 3/97  I<BR>
was told that I would need to stay on asacol or 6mp for the rest of my<BR>
life.  I guess I had to prove them wrong.  Off all med's eating bread and<BR>
potatoes, so far so good.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to all and GOD bless Diane.<BR>

I have been on the diet for 2 years with tremendous (perhaps miraculous!)<BR>
results.  I do occassionally enjoy a cigar (every few days) and have done<BR>
so for years.  It was not until I went on this diet that remission<BR>
occurred.  In fact, I was on a serious downward spiral until I started the<BR>
SCD.<BR>
<BR>
The diet works.  Stick with it.<BR>

Hi Rachel,<BR>
<BR>
When my son was going to the bathroom twelve to fourteen times a day, he<BR>
never had to break from the roller hockey ring during a game or practice.<BR>
I always figured it was the sheer exhilaration he was experiencing when<BR>
he played. And it never failed to bring me to a state of tearful joy to<BR>
watch him in the rink, zooming around at top speed. For a while, I hoped<BR>
we could move beyond this illness by focusing on the emotional realm. We<BR>
tried to do it through hypnosis, acupuncture, biofeedback, three and a<BR>
half years of homeopathy....not much happened. If we could've kept him<BR>
surrounded by friends, on roller blades...twenty four hours a<BR>
day...perhaps, but that wasn't all together feasible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We are so grateful for Elaine's dedication and SCD. It has turned<BR>
Daniel's life around. Right now, he is out for a bike ride on a summer<BR>
evening...away from the bathroom, just being a teenager. <BR>
<BR>
Life is good.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Love,<BR>
<BR>

My daughter Chanelle is off to college this Saturday. It is a miracle when you<BR>
consider that last Oct. she was in the hospital receiving three blood<BR>
transfusions along with massive doses of antibiotics and cortisone. It was<BR>
touch and go for a week if she would need emergency surgery for toxic mega<BR>
colon. She started the SCD diet in Dec. and has followed it with fannatical<BR>
adherance ever since.She has been good about it, never once complaining "why<BR>
me?"  She did suffer two bad flare ups at the three and six month marks.Both<BR>
of these flare up occured when she got down to low doses of prednisone(once at<BR>
7 mg and once at 0) Each time she needed to go baack to 40mg. to put the fire<BR>
out.We have never had the courage to try to get through a flare up without<BR>
drugs because of how fast and hard it hit her the first time. Anyway she has<BR>
been on 8 mg. all summer and holding while we slowly switched her from Asacol<BR>
to Sulfasaline (because of the lactose filler in Asacol). She looks great (no<BR>
gross side effects of prednisone) feels great, and is so joyfilled about going<BR>
to college.<BR>
          I have been cooking for weeks and freezing so I can send her<BR>
whatever she needs to supplement the food plan. She will have a small<BR>
ref.-freezer right in her room and a full kitchen on her floor she can use.<BR>
The food director is a doll and said he will do anything he can to help her.<BR>
If there is a will there is a way. We are determined not to let UC run her<BR>
life and make her decisions for her. She was an honor student in HIgh School<BR>
and played varsity lacrose dispite her UC. We are so grateful to Elaine and<BR>
the SCD and to all of you  for not having to feel alone and for all the great<BR>

Subject: <B>Our Story</B><BR>
<BR>
-- [ From: David Cournoyer * EMC.Ver #2.5.3 ] --<BR>
<BR>
We thought we should give our story since we know about lots of you.<BR>
<BR>
Ten years ago, we were active professionals.  First Shannon mysteriously<BR>
got sick  followed a few months later by Dave.  He was eventually<BR>
diagnosed as UC.  Shannon was never diagnosed - the symptoms were too<BR>
mysterious (nauseous, weak, nervous, parasites).  Believe me, not<BR>
knowing is worse than knowing.  And for both of us to be sick at the<BR>
same time with similar symptoms was very strange.  Dave had diarhhea and<BR>
Shannon didn't usually.  Dave has seen 15 doctors in 4 states with no<BR>
relief.  Several batches of flagyl for parasites, followed by another<BR>
parasite drug, the symptoms persisted.  They put Dave on prednisone and<BR>
sulfasalazine but it just made him worse.  Doctors didn't help Shannon<BR>
so she stopped going and tried natural approaches.  <BR>
<BR>
This summer, we realized what it was:  Lyme Disease we had gotten 12<BR>
years ago on a trip to New England.   We read all of our symptoms on<BR>
lymenet.org.  We both went to the doctor because we didn't feel well<BR>
shortly after the vacation and Shannon had the classic arthritis for<BR>
several months.  We had Dave tested (he has medical coverage) and it was<BR>
positive.  The only treatment for the late disseminated disease (meaning<BR>
you've had it forever and it's fully entrenched) is months of I.V.<BR>
antibiotics.  Shannon's always been allergic to them.  We've been<BR>
searching for another answer.<BR>
<BR>
Dave's current doctor, a naturopath, put him on the blood type diet and<BR>
Shannon joined him.  It was a terrible experience where we both lost<BR>
lots of weight we couldn't afford to lose  but it led us to the web site<BR>
where someone recommended the scd book.  We discovered by elimination<BR>
that grains were hurting us, one by one taking them away until we were<BR>
almost on the scd diet anyway.  Being on two separate diets was terrible<BR>
(Dave's an O  and Shannon's an A)  With Dave's UC, we knew he should try<BR>
the scd.  Shannon went along because of the problem she was having with<BR>
grains.   The diet also kills bacteria, etc., so we knew it should work<BR>
for Lyme Disease.<BR>
<BR>
Only three weeks later, we're both feeling somewhat better.  We can see<BR>
the rainbow on the other side.  Over the course of this illness, we've<BR>
lost everything.  Neither of us can work.  Dave is on disability.  His<BR>
symptoms were specific enough that he could be approved.  We've gone<BR>
bankrupt.  Both of Shannon's parents died and she wasn't well enough to<BR>
go to see them or their funerals (Shannon's family sees her as heartless<BR>
).  <BR>
<BR>
This diet is truly a Godsend.  Sorry we got so longwinded.<BR>

Dear Cathy,<BR>
I so admire your being able to look back at your incident and smile. I wish<BR>
I could recall even one of mine without shuddering. Its been 3 & 1/2 years<BR>
since I began remission on this diet. Your story brought back to mind my<BR>
blackest moment, definately not an Oprah story.<BR>
About 10 years ago, freinds bought tickets for our anneversary to see Elton<BR>
John at madison square garden. I had to meet them & my husband at penn<BR>
station, so I left work, going to the bathroom first of course. I walked<BR>
the 2 blocks to the train station and as I walked up the stairs, IT hit me.<BR>
I had to go SO bad. As the train approached, I seriously considered<BR>
throwing myself in front of it to finally put an end to my miserable<BR>
existance. I can actually feel myself standing there swooning, with the<BR>
train whistle screaming its approach. I always carried underwear with me. I<BR>
got on the train crying, and went into the 2 foot smelly bathroom. The<BR>
floor was filthy and sticky with G-d knows what. I had to remove my shoes,<BR>
trying to do one at a time, to take off my pants. It was just blood and<BR>
mucous I'd released, but even so, it was so disgusting. By the time I met<BR>
them, all I could think about was going home. It was the most miserable<BR>
night of my life. I couldn't shake the horror of what I'd almost done. I<BR>
kept saying nothing was wrong, until the train ride home when I burst into<BR>
tears and told my husband what had happened, leaving out the suicide<BR>
thoughts. In fact, I only told him of that recently. I'm grateful every day<BR>
for Elaine, the diet and the wonderful life I almost threw away.<BR>

Subject: <B>Ken is back--spread the SCD word!</B><BR>
<BR>
Last summer my husband, Ken (29 years old) was diagnosed with Crohn's<BR>
Disease.  He was 6'5", 210 lbs, and went down to 165 pounds in a VERY<BR>
short time.  Really, I thought we would lose him; we had no idea what<BR>
was wrong and it seems our doctors didn't either.  He was so sick that<BR>
he had to go on disability for three months.<BR>
<BR>
During that time he learned about Breaking the Vicious Cycle.  A man at<BR>
work had a relative's young son who was "cured" by this diet.  He was<BR>
impressed with the fact that this woman was on television with Dini<BR>
Petty!  (I presume he meant Elaine.)  He gave me the phone number and<BR>
from there I went to the library and devoured the book.  It made sense.<BR>
Ken read it and agreed.  He went on the diet and began to feel GREAT!<BR>
He did not need to introduce new foods slowly, it was almost an instant<BR>
remission.  He gained back all his weight.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway because he felt so good, he decided he could go back to his old<BR>
way of eating.  I told the SCD list that I would lurk until Ken decided<BR>
to return to the diet.  I had to see him get crampy (D) and sick again,<BR>
although not to the same extreme.  We both knew that if he kept up<BR>
eating this way, he could very well end up with colon cancer.  So, a<BR>
month ago, Ken went back on the diet.  And once again, he is feeling<BR>
great, as though he is not plagued with the disease at all!<BR>
<BR>
Being clergy in a stressful ministry, it is important that my husband<BR>
remain healthy and strong.  We are the Senior Chaplain Couple at a<BR>
Rescue Mission, working with street men and women, and running a<BR>
substance abuse recovery program for men.  These are the outcasts of<BR>
society and very hard to the core.<BR>
<BR>
Working at a Rescue Mission means dodging all types of traditional<BR>
goodies on a daily basis: donuts, brownies, cakes, pies, breads of all<BR>
kinds.  Ken ate these every day!  I'm surprised his relapse wasn't<BR>
faster.  It was actually so slow and gradual we barely noticed he was<BR>
getting sick again.<BR>
<BR>
When I had told the SCD list what was happening, I recieved wonderful<BR>
support from Rachel, Dan, and Val. You said that it would have to be his<BR>
decision, but in the end he would have to come back to the diet as his<BR>
remission would fail going back to a standard American diet.  I am so<BR>
appreciative of all of you on the list.  I am grateful that Ken made the<BR>
decision to go back on the diet, completely free from my nagging or<BR>
hinting.  Most of all I must give the thanks to G-d.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Michelle<BR>
<BR>
PS. I hope this wasn't too long for you all.  There is actually a moral<BR>
to this story.  Spread the word of this fantastic diet to everyone you<BR>
know.  Don't be ashamed and don't be shy.  Word of mouth is a wonderful<BR>
tool and if it were not for a man who knew very little about it except<BR>
that it had helped a distant relative...  where would my husband be<BR>
today?  Perhaps with the Lord.  Who knows.<BR>
<BR>
PS.  Rachel, is it possible to forward this letter to Elaine?  I think<BR>
she would be encouraged by it.  Does she have email?  Let me know<BR>
please.

Subject: <B>Re: Ryan's Story</B><BR>
<BR>
Hello All,<BR>
<BR>
I know this will be long, but I feel Ryan and I should tell his story<BR>
now that he has made the 1 year mark.<BR>
<BR>
My son, Ryan, was diagnosed Jan. 1st, 1996 with Crohn's.  He was in <BR>
8th grade at the time.  His pediatrician had no idea of what his <BR>
problem was, and told us to take Ryan to a GI specialist.<BR>
<BR>
The GI had Ryan undergo a CAT scan and upper GI.  By the results of<BR>
these two tests he was able to determine Ryan had Crohn's.  We had <BR>
never heard of this disease. He suggested prednisone for starters.  <BR>
By Feb. he was much worse.  The GI suggested resectioning surgery.  A <BR>
colonoscopy detected that surgery could kill him, because the lining <BR>
of his intestines was all but gone.<BR>
<BR>
The doctors had no answers, they suggested we take Ryan to the Mayo <BR>
Clinic in Rochester, MN.  While there Ryan was given extensive drug <BR>
therapy. We took him home 3 weeks later, with 6 different <BR>
prescriptions.  Ryan did well on the drugs.  As summer came he was <BR>
doing very well.  He was tapering off the drugs.  As fall approached, <BR>
Ryan began to flare.  He was again put back on all the drugs. <BR>
By Feb. of 1997 Ryan was back at the Mayo again.  This time a<BR>
resectioning was done; however, 3 weeks later Ryan was in pain, <BR>
the symptoms were returning.  The doctors at the Mayo did another <BR>
colonoscopy and discovered the colon was now infected.  <BR>
By Oct. 1997, the doctors were advising more surgery.  It was at <BR>
this point that a doctor in the ER told us of his brother.  He<BR>
said his brother had Crohn's and after 5 years started a diet that<BR>
helped him more than drugs.  He gave us the name of Elaine's book<BR>
and said, &quot;you didn't hear this from me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It took a lot of phone calls and searching but finally found a local<BR>
bookstore that could order the book for us.  November 9, 1997 Ryan<BR>
began the diet, within 4 days he started to feel relief.  By the end<BR>
of the first week, Ryan no longer had the bloody stools, the cramps, <BR>
or the D.  By the second week, Ryan was getting more energenic.  He<BR>
did experience the 2nd month flare, but it only lasted for 4 days.  <BR>
While on the diet, we started tapering Ryan's drugs.  Ryan has now <BR>
been drug free for 7 months.  He does take vitamins, magnesium, <BR>
potassium, and calcium.  Most of these were suggested by members of <BR>
the list, over the last year.   <BR>
<BR>
Ryan and I have learned so much by reading through everyone's <BR>
postings. Every time we had a question for the list, BINGO, someone<BR>
else asked before we could.  So, we just sat back and waited to read <BR>
the posts.<BR>
<BR>
During August, we called Elaine to tell her of Ryan's success.  <BR>
She asked us to help spread the word.  Well, we had already done that.  <BR>
We've told several people in our area.  We even spoke to the Crohn's <BR>
Support group in our area.  I offer to help others get started if they<BR>
want to commit to the diet.  Our next plan is to buy enough copies of <BR>
the book, to have them put in all branches of our public library.<BR>
<BR>
Good health.<BR>

Subject: <B>Re: Need help to get started on the carbohydrate diet.</B><BR>

<P>Sheri,
<BR>Wow, your story sounds so much like mine.  I just subscribed to the list
yesterday, and posted some general background, but it sounds like you're
also new so you may not have read it.<BR>
<P>The quickie version:  I was diagnosed at 17 with Crohn's Disease.  I've
had one resection (6.5 years ago).  I'm now 27 and teaching high school
math.  A few weeks ago it would have been more accurate to say I was
trying to teach high school math, as I had no energy and was in very
frequent pain/discomfort which I just couldn't stand anymore.  I know
where every public restroom is in many areas of NH, and I know the walls
of my bathroom at home more intimately than any other room!  I was, even
more, just trying to survive.<BR>
<P>I knew the diet would help, as I had started it most of the way (some
cheating) over the summer and it helped significantly.  I
couldn't/didn't maintain it completely once school started, and I had
gotten to the point 3 weeks ago where I was almost as sick as I had been
last June.<BR>
<P>I restarted at square one, and after 3 weeks I feel GREAT!!  This is the
third day in a row I've had no discomfort to speak of.  The trips to the
bathroom have decreased from at least 6-10 a day to between 2-4,
frequently (though not yet always) formed.  These things really excite
me these days.  It feels SO good.<BR>
<P>Last summer I had certain things I just couldn't resist, and I didn't
improve nearly as quickly as I have this time.  Following the diet
strictly is definitely important.  It helps even when you cheat, but it
won't have the chance to fully work it's magic.<BR>
<P>AND, once you start to feel better, it starts to be easier to maintain. 
Now when I look at even my favorite forbidden foods, I connect them with
how sick I was not long ago.  It was awful, and I NEVER want to be back
there.  The more I associate certain foods with that pain, the less
appealing they seem.  It helps a lot.<BR>
<P>So yes, the diet works.<BR>
<P>The last thing is, I too had the idea that I would be
sacrificing/investing a couple of years of difficultly in order to be
&quot;over it&quot; after that and never have to worry about it again.  One thing
that has helped in the last 3 weeks, as compared to my summer attempt,
is that I realize that the diet itself is no sacrifice at all compared
to the sacrifice of not being able to live any kind of enjoyable life
when I was so sick.  It starts to seem like a gift.  Yes, I would like
to eat garlic bread again in a few years, but if I don't it's still
okay.  I wasn't convinced of that until recently, but now I need no more
convincing.<BR>
<P>Good luck and keep us posted!!
<P>Nancy

<P>Today I have been on this wonderful diet for 2 years!<BR>
I have had Crohn's for over 8 years now and the last 2 years of having  
Crohn's have been great!  I thank GOD for Elaine and my doctor for  
introducing me to the diet.  When I started the diet I was at my worst.   
I weighed 125lb and I am 5'11&quot;.  My normal weight prior to having  
Crohn's was 180lb.  When I was diagnosed with Crohn's I went down to  
150lb and I could not gain a pound for the life of me.  Every day I had  
pain in my gut and every day I had to worry when I was leaving my house  
where the next bathroom was located.  Once I started the diet I noticed  
a great improvement.  I was gaining approximately a pound a day for the  
first 34 days.  My energy level went through the roof.  Well 2 years ago  
on this day I started the diet and to this day that was the best  
Christmas present I can ever receive HEALTH! <BR>
God bless you all and Happy Holidays.<BR>
P.S. There is something on the News at 5:00pm tonight regarding a break

<BR>Dear Steve,
<BR>I don't usually correspond, I'm more of a silent member of the group, but
 after reading your message I feel compelled to respond. I'll tell you a
 little bit about myself and my history with Crohn's Disease. I was
 diagnosed at the age of fifteen (I'm now 21) and much to my surprise
 because I didn't feel I was &quot;dealing&quot; with anything by any stretch of the
 imagination. I thought it was &quot;normal&quot; to be slightly fatigued and have
 boughts of diarreah which were few and far between. A colonoscopy soon
 showed I actually had extensive Crohn's all the way through the digestive
 tract and was anemic (which was causing the fatigue as a result of
 malabsorption and chronic bleeding - sometimes the blood loss can be so
 small over such a long period of time that we don't notice it.) <BR>Anyways, I
 more or less grumbled along without taking the drugs for about a year and
 then resorted to the horrible stuff - worst of all the prednisone. During
 all of this the SCD had always been surfacing, but I never really took it
 seriously, fooling myself with the reasoning &quot;I'm just not sick enough&quot;.
 What I'm about to tell you next, makes me wish I had taken the SCD sooner
 and embraced it as the foundation to intestinal health that it is. In my
 last year of high school, I had a SEVERE exacerbation of my disease. I
 ended up in the hospital for a total of six weeks on TPN (kind-of like an
 intravenous feeding to give the intestine rest), MAJOR doses of prednisone,
 and the horror of surgery hanging over my head. <BR>My GI at the time felt
 that a complete colectomy (meaning having a pouch) was the only solution -
 without it I would deteriorate more and put my life in jeapordy is what he
 thought. I had never been so scared, but you can understand, as a young
 person, I was determined to leave no stone unturned in order to avoid &quot;the
 knife&quot;. I talked my GI into letting me go home and and do nasogastric
 feeding (every night I would insert a tube through my nose, down my throat,
 and into my stomach to feed myself with liquid stuff much like Boost or
 Ensure), this in itself was horrible but still better to me than surgery
 and the pouch. This feeding sort of masked the symptoms of CD and then
 when I started to try to eat normally (still not smart enough to try the
 SCD, because there was no arguing that now I categorically was sick
 enough!) I was TERRIBLY ILL, couldn't leave the house as I needed a
 bathroom literally 24 hrs/day and now I was extremely underweight. Words
 cannot express how miserable I was. <BR>FINALLY, with the help of my parents I
 started the SCD. It's been 2 1/2 years since I made the commitment and I
 haven't looked back, I consider it my lifeline. It truly has given me my
 life back. My days are happy and fulfilled and best of all I'm physically
 entact. I'm not scared anymore of surgery because I have the best
 prevention of that in the SCD. <BR>I know I've been rather long-winded and I
 don't want to scare you I simply think you should see a professional, find
 out what is going on and if your official diagnoses is IBD, then I cannot
 more highly recommend the SCD. It's non-invasive and works - I'm living
 proof.
<BR>All the best!

My husband has Crohn's disease - about 8 years now.  He has been through alot.
<BR>
Nine months ago he went on this food plan.  We found Elaine's book through a
co-worker of mine.  He is soooo much better.  His last colonoscopy was
excellent.  There is hope.

<P>This is simply a triumphant success note!!
<P>I started really gaining some weight, slowly but surely, a few weeks
ago, but this week it's really taken off!  I had lost 25 lbs being sick
and another 4 when I first started the diet.  
<P>I have now gained back a total of 15 lbs!  Another 10-15 and I'll be
back to normal!!
<P>Yahoo!!!!  I really I am going to have the rest of myself back again
soon!
<P>Thank you so much to everyone who has given advice and suggestions and
to those who have just read my messages.  Writing to this list sometimes
is just what I need to feel like someone out there is listening. 
<P>THANK YOU EVERYONE!!

<P>I have been on the diet for just over a year and it has been a great 
remedy for me.  I have just recently discovered this list and it has 
helped me a lot, and helped me stick with it.  It is so good to hear 
other peoples stories.  I am from Kansas and wanted to know if there was 
anybody else around here that was on the diet.  I have been reading this 
list for a while and just decided to get on and say something.  I was 
diagnosed with Crohn's when I had horrible gut pains.  It was the night 
before I was to go into the Darrien Jungle in Panama on a missions trip.  
I has been a wild ride since then, but the diet has been a great help.   <BR>
Thanks.

<P>Well I have been on this wonderful diet for over 2 years now and I feel 
&quot;Thank God&quot; cured!  I am eating things that I really shouldn't be eating 
with no adverse reaction.  I stuck with the diet 110% for over a year.  
After that I started to introduce foods real slow and nothing.  I was 
125 LB. on 12/24/96 and now I am 186 LB.  I don't run to the bathroom 12 
times a day, I don't feel any pain in my gut, and no bleeding.  I am 
currently eating on a regular basis bread, pasta, rice, milk, potatoes 
and sugar type foods.  I did not just throw all these foods down my 
throat.  First I introduced pasta for a few weeks, then bread, for a 
couple of moths, etc. <BR>
I recommended a few people to this diet and to this web e-mail list. <BR>
Well as I said I was going to check in every few months.  This is the 
only time I have chance, I am busy with work. <BR>
<P>Good health and God bless,<BR>
