&gt; Hi everyone,<BR>
&gt; There have been a few terms mentioned in recent posts that have me a<BR>
&gt; little confused.  First someone said something about too much protein in<BR>
&gt; the diet causing swelling.  I have never heard of this or had it happen<BR>
&gt; to me, and I'm curious what is the mechanism behind it?</FONT><BR><BR>

    Here is an article that elucidates the dynamics whereby eating
certain foods can result in such conditions as swelling or achiness.
From what I understand, as the inflamed gut heals, it also become more
permeable to molecules that shouldn't be crossing the membrane barrier.
Ironically the gut can become more &quot;leaky&quot; as it heals from inflammation
because it is starting to absorb more in general.     In about my second
month, I had more achiness and swelling.  It seemed to coincide with my
D stopping and starting to have more formed stools.  So the leaky gut
hypothesis really made sense to me.<BR><BR>
