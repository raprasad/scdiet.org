<TT>I can identify with the tiredness though.  I used to think
that letting my<BR>
&gt;self get too stressed and then too tired brought on a flare.  But now
I<BR>
&gt;think that its the other way round.  At the moment I'm in a flare and
I'm<BR>
&gt;oh so tired yet I'm not overworked in my life right now.  Its part and<BR>
&gt;parcel of our bodies struggling to cope, I think. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Being tired...Reminds me of a comment made to me by Chinese Medicine doctor<BR>
Efrem Korngold...sorry, I forgot to look up the book title. It is a fairly<BR>
major book on Chinese medicine and should be easy to find. -Carol Wright<BR>
<BR>
Below is copyright 1997 by Carol Wright...<BR>
<BR>
Efrem Korngold, L.Ac., O.M.D., of San Francisco's Chinese Medicine Works
is co-author<BR>
with his wife Harriet Beinfield, L.Ac. of  book title [publisher, date].<BR>
Korngold and his wife were among the first acupuncturists to be licenced
by the state of California.<BR>
<BR>
To Korngold, symptoms of digestive disorders are signals to look at a big<BR>
picture. (To get a sense of how important this system is, I phone to ask
Korngold about Chinese<BR>
alternatives to antacids, and he answers with a two-hour lecture.) &quot;The
function of the<BR>
stomach is part of a larger functional system, the spleen network,&quot;
he explains. &quot;The<BR>
spleen governs the whole process of digestion, assimilation, and elimination:
from mouth<BR>
to anus and everything in between. The system is the mechanism for how the
body<BR>
assimilates new substances, feeds itself, and determines what is good for
it<BR>
or what is bad. Any interference with that system will represent an<BR>
infringement on the body's entire resources. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The energy or Qi of this system has particular directions to it. Food
goes in the mouth,<BR>
then down (the stomach's Qi direction) until it is excreted; liquid,<BR>
nutrients, and energy assimilated from food goes in the spleen's Qi<BR>
direction--up. One of the first signs of distress is that the energies of<BR>
these two functions have reversed: vomiting indicates the reverese energies<BR>
of the stomach, while in diarrhea, the liquidity is lost downward. It is<BR>
really serious when those are happening simultaneously, like in cases of<BR>
food poisoning. Here, the body tries to get rid of something quickly; it
is<BR>
not concerned with digestion, just getting out of a dangerous situation.<BR>
Vomiting and diarrhea are very exhausting; it takes a big effort to go<BR>
against one's normal activities.&quot; <BR>

<BR>
To Anna and the rest of the group,<BR>
<BR>
Thank you Anna for suggesting I search the IBD list archives for info <BR>
on the subject at hand. I quickly found the attached article, posted <BR>
from the CCFA--as mainstream as it gets. Given this information, I'm <BR>
going to be very cautious about using NSAID's, reserving them for rare <BR>
occasions if at all. I am also going to pass this info on to my dr., <BR>
who was an old friend before he became my dr and who does use some <BR>
alternative medicine in his practice.<BR>

Subject: <B>NSAIDs Alert</B> (From Voices, via CCFA)<BR>
<BR>
Here is an interesting article about use of NSAIDs and IBDs.....<BR>
<BR>
ARTHRITIS MEDICINES AND IBD<BR>
<BR>
The last two decades have seen a host of new arthritis medicines called<BR>
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  At first it was thought<BR>
that they would be less harmful to the gastrointestinal tract than<BR>
aspirin, but gradually it became evident that NSAIDs, too, could<BR>
cause harm to the gut.  A famous rheumatologist, Dr. Charles Ragan,<BR>
whom I knew years ago said, &quot;Anything that's good for the<BR>
joints is bad for the gut.&quot;  I came to think of that as Ragan's Law<BR>
of the Gut and it has held up pretty well over the years.  The<BR>
first problems that were recognized with the new drugs were stomach and<BR>
duodenal ulcers and bleeding, just as had been previously seen<BR>
with aspirin.  In time, a series of other reports were published showing<BR>
that NSAIDs also could damage the small intestine and colon.<BR>
<BR>
It turns out that NSAIDs can cause a type of colitis that cannot be<BR>
distinguished from IBD and, more important to the IBD patient, NSAIDs can<BR>
worsen or perpetuate Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.<BR>
They also can cause the recurrence of IBD in patients whose disease<BR>
has gone into remission.<BR>
<BR>
In 1987, Howard Taubin from Bridgeport and I published in the {Annals of<BR>
Internal Medicine} a report of four patients whose IBD was exacerbated<BR>
by NSAIDs.  Since then, I have seen three more such persons and three<BR>
others who had what appeared to be IBD, but actually was NSAID-induced<BR>
colitis.  In addition, some of my patients who have had mild<BR>
continuous disease have been better since the Advil they had taken<BR>
for menstrual cramps or headaches was stopped.  Other gastroenterologists<BR>
have told me of similar experiences.<BR>
<BR>
More recent studies from England have shown that NSAIDs can cause loss of<BR>
blood and protein from the intestine and, in some patients, cause<BR>
strictures of the ileum and colon.<BR>
<BR>
Many patients with IBD have arthritis, so it is likely that they may be
tempted<BR>
to use NSAIDs at some time in their lives.  While many or perhaps even most<BR>
IBD patients may not experience deleterious effects from NSAIDs, it seems<BR>
wise for all IBD sufferers to avoid them or at least discuss<BR>
them with their gastroenterologists and use them with great caution.<BR>
<BR>
The following is a partial list os NSAIDs available either by<BR>
prescription or over the counter:<BR>
<BR>
Ibuprofen (Motrin, Rufin, Advil, Nuprin, Mediprin, Trendar, Midrin 200,<BR>
Haltran), Anaprox, Ansaid, Clinoril, Dolobid, Feldene, Indocin,<BR>
Meclomen, Nalfon, Naprosyn, Orudis, Ponstel, Tolectin and Voltaren.<BR>
<BR>
Small amounts of Ibuprofen are present in other combination<BR>
pills that are recommended for colds and flu-like symptoms, so be careful<BR>
what you take.<BR>

<B>Re: SCD:  Dr. holland's comments about NSAIDs</B><BR>
 Fri, 24 Jan 1997 20:44:17 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I must have not been crafty enough.  There is evidence that NSAIDS do not<BR>
affect UC.  This is a stronger statement than the following &quot;There
is no<BR>
evidence that they hurt&quot;  So, the consensus is that a patient with
UC need<BR>
not fear taking NSAIDs.  The evidence for this is the epidemiologic studies<BR>
that looked at NSAIDs in IBD.  Crohn's patients had flares associated with<BR>
NSAID's, whild UC patients did not.<BR>
<BR>
The conclusion that this is a blame the person attitude is unwarranted.
 In<BR>
short eMail exchanges I am not going to spend a lot of time with nuances.<BR>
Since there is evidence that NSAID's do not worsen UC, one of two<BR>
circumstances come to mind.  There may be situations that are correllated<BR>
with NSAID use and UC flares is one possibility.  I have patients who tell<BR>
me that stress worsens their UC, thus one conceivable way NSAID use would<BR>
correllate with UC flares is that the NSAIDs would be used at the same time<BR>
as the stress for some reason. Since epidemiologic studies only measure<BR>
average behaior, subgroups that worsened on NSAID's might be missed in an<BR>
epidemiologic study unless some variable related to the propensity were<BR>
measured.  So for an individual patient it is simple.  If NSAID's worsen<BR>
the condition, then NSAID's worsen the condition and should be avoided.<BR>
The interesting matter with UC and Crohn's is that since Crohn's is<BR>
associated with NSAID's and since it can be hard to classify IBD correctly<BR>
as either Crohn's or UC, a patient who flares on NSAIDs may actually have<BR>
Crohn's.  This evidence is not strong enough to make the diagnosis by<BR>
itself, but it should prompt reconsideration.<BR>

 Thu, 23 Jan 1997 11:59:21 GMT<BR>
<BR>
&gt;     Kim also asked about making progress on the diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;     This brings to mind a topic that we have been going over from time
to<BR>
&gt;     time....whether someone starting the diet, while symptomatic, can<BR>
&gt;     expect dramatic results without staying on prednisone for a while?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;     Kim, I believe our conclusion was no, that someone who is moderately<BR>
&gt;     sick should stay on prednisone while starting the diet, and slowly<BR>
&gt;     ease off the prednisone as symptoms improve.  And of course this
goes<BR>
&gt;     doubly if there is blood present.  Again, does anyone disagree?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;     Bart Hansen<BR>
&gt;     hansenb@frb.gov<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Elaine has said that in some cases the diet may work by itself, but in<BR>
severe cases (ie bleeding and diarrhea) no one should expect to get too
far<BR>
without medication. I personally am using cortisone enemas and chinese<BR>
herbal tablets (no oral cortisone and making good progress)<BR>

Hi All,<BR>
<BR>
Well I've finally got good stools happening - firm and no more diarrhea,<BR>
but still some bleeding. I don't know if it was<BR>
<BR>
the avoidance of dairy<BR>
or the new herbs I'm taking<BR>
<BR>
but what has definitely returned is my Candida problem. In the last week
I<BR>
was not eating too well, and missed a lot of sleep. (Bad boy eh?) anyway<BR>
this weekend it all caught up with me and hit me like a falling piano.<BR>
Lethargy, dizziness, bloating, anal itch, thrush in the mouth,<BR>
disorientation, poor decission making and depression. and Chemical<BR>
sensitivity, (I went to a dept store and nearly feinted with the smell of<BR>
plastic) All these are classic symptoms and hit me suddenly.<BR>
<BR>
So I am re-considering my diet. (and lifestyle) I think what really brought<BR>
it on was bottled fruit juice and heaps of stewed fruit and honey. and<BR>
fresh fruit juice. I am going to reduce and spread out my simple<BR>
carbohydrate intake and take some anti-fungals. and see what happens.<BR>
<BR>

</B>Mon, 3 Feb 1997 1:30:13 GMT<TT><BR>
<BR>
&gt;Dear Rachel,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Very happy to hear of your wonderful test results. It is very encouraging<BR>
&gt;for those on the diet hoping to have the same results one day. We have
a<BR>
&gt;few questions regarding your progress, We hope you will not mind commenting<BR>
&gt;on them.</TT><BR>
<BR>
Not at all<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&gt;1 How long were you on the diet before you were symtom free?</TT><BR>
<BR>
I was not in all that much trouble when I began the diet. Some bleeding<BR>
(but not hemmoraging as in the past), bloating and D. I began improving<BR>
immediately. Thrived on the yogurt. In the first year I still had some<BR>
bouts, but usually associated with questionable ingredients in what I<BR>
thought were safe foods. May 1st will be 2 years on the diet for me, and<BR>
frankly, I can't remember when I had my last bout. My health has been<BR>
perfect for many months now.<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&gt;<BR>
&gt;2 What medication did you have along with the diet and when were you
able<BR>
&gt;to come of the meds?</TT><BR>
<BR>
I was on Azulphadine since first diagnosed about 8 years ago, and on<BR>
steroids when the bleeding was out of control. I took myself off of all<BR>
meds about 6 months ago, when I felt I no longer needed any.<BR>
<TT>&gt;<BR>
&gt;3 Did you experience setbacks along the way? We have talked to many
who<BR>
&gt;said that they did have ups and downs.</TT><BR>
<BR>
As I said I did have some minor flares in that 1st year. They rarely lasted<BR>
more than a day or two.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <TT>We are a little anxious as Martine<BR>
&gt;will be going for a colonoscopy on the 6th. This will be the first since<BR>
&gt;two years ago when after a colonoscopy (entire inflammation) they wanted
to<BR>
&gt;remove her entire colon.</TT><BR>
<BR>
Me too.When I was diagnosed, I was told I'd probably lose my colon within
a<BR>
few years.<BR>
<TT>&gt;<BR>
&gt;4 Now that the test result is normal for you, does this mean that your
BM<BR>
&gt;are also closer to normal?</TT><BR>
<BR>
Absolutely!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Wishing you the best of health,<BR>
Rachel<BR>

<P><B>Re: Rachel</B><BR>
Tue, 4 Feb 1997 2:39:43 GMT<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&gt;Rachel can you please tell me who decided to take you off the medication<BR>
&gt;about 6 months ago. Was it that you decided to go off without your doctors<BR>
&gt;knowledge.</TT><BR>
<BR>
Dear Jim,<BR>
I took myself off the Azulphaadine after many months of feeling well. I
am<BR>
NOT advising anyone else to do the same. I couldn't stand it if anyone were<BR>
to follow my lead and then relapse.<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&gt;How long where you on the medications that you were talking<BR>
&gt;about, and how did you decrease each one.</TT><BR>
<BR>
I was no longer on steroids when I stopped and I'd been on varying doses
of<BR>
the azulphadine over the last 8 years. I was actually down to 2 when I<BR>
stopped (although the doctor wanted me on 4 to 6). I decreased one pill
at<BR>
a time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<TT>&gt;I am supposed to go for my first ever colonoscopy once<BR>
&gt;I am a little bit better,(about another month or so) I am really nervous.<BR>
&gt;Enough rambling, hope to hear from you soon.</TT><BR>
<BR>
The roughest part of the procedure is the prep which involves cleaning out<BR>
your colon by drinking a gallon of stuff (for me it was called golightly)<BR>
which gives you severe diharea and fasting the day before the procedure.<BR>
Once there they give you an IV with a sedative of some kind that makes you<BR>
aware of what is going on, but not too uncomfortable. I've done at least<BR>
half dozeon of these over the years and have become an old pro at them.<BR>
Truly, they are no big deal.Please keep me posted on how you are doing.<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes.<BR>

Hello all,<BR>
<BR>
My chiropractor is recommending a juice fast with some kind of liquid<BR>

A little over a year ago I fasted with no food, juice, or supplements. I
drank only water. I did this fast for 6 days. I don't recommend fasting
with juice because your body will go into ketosis during a fast and I personally
think that drinking anything other than water messes up the fast process
and body acidity levels. This book that I read and this program that I know
about fasting has people fast for up to 54 days with water only. Believe
it or not. Most people think that you would die after 3 days for some reason
but I fasted for 6 days but was weak because I was working at the same time.
Fasting is good for the body to help it to repair itself. During my fast
my bloating disappeared, and I felt pretty healthy. This didn't cure me
of my Crohns but I think helped a bit. <BR>
I don't think that it can harm you. <BR>

Fasting is incredibly valuable...I've just researched a lot about fasting,<BR>
and these days, the consensus is to fast with juices and with vegetable<BR>
broths. This gives you the energy and the base nutrients and the liquids
you<BR>
need, but will not stimulate the appetite center (after about 3 days). You<BR>
also do not have anything to digest and do not use up your own energy doing<BR>
so. Those on juice/broth fasts will generally have increasing energy over<BR>
the period of the fast. Can't go into more now...<BR>
<BR>
Check out this website for someone who is a professional fast consultant.<BR>
I'll give you a book title to look at for doing short juice fasts.<BR>

Hi Bill, </B><BR>
Metagenics puts out a product called UltraClear and another called<BR>
Sustain. I see that fasts are very helpful to my clients and very<BR>
beneficial for myself. I began my first fasts in 1974 after reading Arnold<BR>
Ehret's, the Mucus Free Diet Healing System.<BR>
Read over all the ingredients in the UltraClear. Very often these formulas<BR>
violate the SCD diet. Make sure that whatever you choose to fast on is okay<BR>
for the SCD diet.<BR>
I think a fast could be a good idea for UC. It's important to choose the<BR>
right fluids to fast on so that they soothe cleanse tonify the intestinal<BR>
tract. Raw vegetable juices are very nutritious and soothing. They provide<BR>
minerals and energy.Distilled water and herb teas are good too. Fasting<BR>
gives the intestines a rest and a chance to heal more quickly.<BR>

Fasting, was popular for internal health, but recently the trend has been<BR>
away from drastic fasts which can unbalance the bowel flora, to a more<BR>
gradual cleansing through a balanced diet.<BR>
<BR>
Regular repeat REGULAR wholesome meals are the best way to balance the<BR>
metabolism and if it is whole food, you can be assured of a safer cleansing<BR>
process. especially if you regularly include garlic and celery every day.<BR>

Be Careful guys,</B><BR>
<BR>
A water only fast is fine for relatively healthy people who can fast that<BR>
long for 54 days. In most countries, it is illegal to fast more than 1 week<BR>
(5days here) without the supervision of a medical practitioner. There are<BR>
many dangers of ketosis especially for the mildly hypoglaecemic and<BR>
diabetic. Also mucous as everyone knows when you have a runny nose, is very<BR>
salty. So is blood. The loss of these body fluids through bleeding or<BR>
inflamation of the mucosa, even diarrhea, can mean life-threatening<BR>
electrolyte imbalances not within 54 days or just a few days but within
a<BR>
few hours. so be careful to be supervised especially when diarrhea bleeding<BR>
or vomiting are present.<BR>
<BR>

You mentioned cleansing fasts. Carrot and Celery are traditionally used
on<BR>
such fasts, as they make a good nutritious combination - one root vege one<BR>
leafy vege. with spinach or some other dark green vege, they are<BR>
unbeatable. the celery is used for its high mineral content and for is<BR>
diuretic properties which help the kidneys to eliminate.<BR>
