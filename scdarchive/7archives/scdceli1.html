<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Until 1952, the most prominent experts in coeliac disease - a wasting
condition associated with the severe malabsorption of food - agreed that it
was caused by carbohydrate intolerance, the inability to digest certain
types of carbohydrate.  A diet avoiding these carbohydrates was found to
treat the condition effectively.  Then an article in the Lancet started the
current fashion that coeliacs are merely allergic to gluten.  The success
of a gluten-free diet, however, required the diagnosis of coeliac disease
to be thenceforth restricted only to those patients who benefited from such
a diet.  Author and researcher Elaine Gottschall explains that this change
has left thousands of people with severe symptoms which are going
undiagnosed and untreated.</FONT></B>

The last time anyone counted, there were 15,000 named diseases of man, and
cures for 5,000 of them.  Yet it remains the dream of every young doctor to
discover a new disease.  That is the fastest and surest way to gain
prominence within the medical profession.  Practically speaking, it is much
better to discover a new disease than to find a cure for an old one; your
cure will be tested, disputed and argued over for years, while a new
disease is readily and rapidly accepted.</FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; (Michael Crichton)

<BR>
<BR>
Coeliac disease appears to have always existed. Because its numerous
symptoms mimic those of several other conditions and because an obvious
cause has been elusive throughout the years, its recognition as a distinct
disorder and one which physicians could readily diagnose has been fraught
with disagreement.
<BR>
<BR>
One of the first descriptions of this disorder was given in the early years
of the Roman Empire by the physicial Aretaeus, who refers to &quot;coeliac
disease&quot; as a chronic diarrhoea condition consisting of undigested food,
lasting an extended period, and a debilitation of the whole body. [<A HREF="#ANCHOR02">2</A>]
Arataeus described the diarrhoea as being light in colour, offensive in
odour, and accompanied by flatulence.  Additionally the patient is
described as &quot;emaciated and atrophied, pale, feeble, incapable of
performing any of his accustomed works.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In 1855, Dr Gull writing in Guy's Hospital Reports [<A HREF="#ANCHOR03">3</A>] outlined the
symptoms found in a 13 year-old boy that clearly suggest coeliac disease as
we understand it today: enlarged abdomen, frequent and voluminous stools of
a dull, chalky colour.
<BR>
<BR>
A few years later, in 1888, Dr Samuel Gee laid the foundation for not only
describing the condition, but also establishing criteria for diagnosis. 
Additionally, he established guidelines for successfully treating the
condition with a dietary approach.  In his classic report &quot;On the Coeliac
Affection&quot;, he wrote<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080">There is a kind of chronic indigestion which is met with in persons of all
ages, yet is especially apt to affect children between one and five years
old Signs of the disease are yielded by the faeces; being loose, not
formed, but not watery; more bulky than the food taken would seem to
account for; pale in colour, as if devoid of bile, yeasty, frothy, an
appearance due to fermentation; stench often very great, the food having
undergone putrefaction rather than concoction. The causes of the disease
are obscure.  Children who suffer from it are not all weak in constitution.
Errors in diet may perhaps be a cause, but what error? </FONT>[<A HREF="#ANCHOR04">4</A>]
<BR>
<BR>
Despite the meagreness of Gee's information about coeliac disease, he saw
clearly several important facts that escaped many later investigations:
<BR>
<BR>

(1) If the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	and that cow's milk is the least suited kind of food, that highly <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	starchy food, rice, sago, corn flour, are unfit.
<BR>
<BR>
(2)	We must never forget that what the patient takes beyond his power <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	of digestion does harm. (Gee implied that unfit foods played more than a<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	negative role and actually produced a pathologic condition in the digestive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;	tract.)
<BR>

<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+1"><B>Intestinal Fermentation</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
For many years there were numerous reports on the cause as well as the
treatment for what appeared to be coeliac.  While these inconsistent and
inconclusive reports appeared in Europe, there was much less interest in
North America.  Shortly after the turn of the century, however, Drs L
Emmett Holt Sr, Director of Children's Medicine at Bellevue Hospital, and
Christian Herter of Columbia University worked together for over seven
years on the clinical as well as the theoretical aspects of this disorder. 
Their conclusions, published in 1908, entitled <I>On Infantilism from Chronic
Intestinal Infection</I> included the following main points:
<BR>
<BR>
(1)	There is a pathological state of childhood marked by a striking
retardation in growth of the skeleton, the muscles and the various organs
and associated with a chronic intestinal infection characterised by the
overgrowth and persistence of bacterial flora belonging normally to the
nursling period.
<BR>
<BR>
(2)	The chief manifestations of this intestinal infantilism are arrest in
the development of the body but maintenance of good mental powers and a
fair development of the brain; marked abdominal distention; a slight or
moderate or considerable degree of simple anaemia; the rapid onset of
physical and mental fatigue; irregularities of intestinal digestion
resulting in frequent diarrhoeal seizures. [<A HREF="#ANCHOR05">5</A>]
<BR>
<BR>
Drs Holt and Herter continued in their monograph to describe the dominant
bacteria found in the stools as well as some of the byproducts of
intestinal fermentation and putrefaction.  They noted that fat appeared in
the stool and attributed this to impaired fat absorption.  Also, note was
made of increased mucus in the stool along with evidence of abnormal
shedding of intestinal cells.  They continued to stress that two leading
features of this intestinal infantilism must be further investigated: 
<BR>
(1) The retardation of growth; 
<BR>(2) The chronic intoxication.  <BR>
They commented
that retardation in growth could be attributed to malabsorption of
nutrients and the malabsorption could probably be due to a chronic
inflammation located in the ileum and colon associated with the presence of
abnormal forms of bacteria.  The chronic intoxication, they were certain,
resulted from the action of products of bacterial origin with the toxins
having as their main target the nervous system and muscles.
<BR>
<BR>
They concluded their treatise by stating:
<FONT COLOR="#800080">
Temporary relapses are very common in the course of this disease, even when
great care is being taken to prevent them.  The most .frequent cause of
such relapses is the attempt to encourage growth by the use of increased
amounts of carbohydrates.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><HR noshade SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+1"><B>Disordered Carbohydrate Digestion</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Although Herter's conclusions failed to gain acceptance, his observations
were so perceptive that further researchers &quot;stood on his shoulders&quot; in
pursuing the most effective dietary treatment.  He saw that in every case
proteins were very well handled, fats were handled moderately well, while
carbohydrates were badly tolerated, almost invariably causing relapse or a
return of diarrhoea after a period of improvement.  He said, &quot;It has been
already mentioned that the carbohydrates are the obvious and fruitful cause
of derangements of digestion that are clinically determinable, especially
diarrhoea and flatulence.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the interest shown by Drs Holt and Herter had been transmitted
to Dr Holt's two younger assistants at the Vanderbilt Clinic, Dr John
Howland and Dr Sidney V Haas.  In 1921, Howland, in his presidential
address before the American Pediatric Society, read a paper on &quot;Prolonged
Intolerance to Carbohydrates&quot;[<A HREF="#ANCHOR06">6</A>].  Although Howland did not use the term
coeliac disease (the condition was still known by a great variety of names)
he described his cases vividly:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080">
There are loose stools from time to time with loss of weight. The condition
improves between the attacks somewhat, but sooner or later a relapse occurs
and there is a renewed loss of weight.  The relapses are increasingly
severe. Eventually, there is a condition of marked malnutrition in a
peevish, fretful, but often precocious child. The abdomen is distended at
first intermittently, and then almost constantly.  The stools are never
normal Even between attacks of diarrhea they are large, light gray in
color, often frothy, and usually very foul.. Growth suffers in proportion
to the length of time that the symptoms persist, and many children are
greatly below the average in height.  From clinical experience, it has been
found that of all the elements of food, carbohydrate is the one which must
be excluded rigorously; that with this greatly reduced, the protein and fat
are almost always well digested even though the absorption of fat may not
be as satisfactory as in health.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Dr Howland warned that after initial improvement occurs with the
elimination of carbohydrates, the stage where carbohydrates are added is
the most difficult.  He explained that although the initial phase may be
time consuming, &quot;these patients well repay the efforts expended on them. 
They do not  remain semi-invalids, many become vigorous and strong, some
even with no trace of dietary idiosyncrasies... Halfway measures are quite
unavailing and cause only loss of time.' Other doctors confirmed Howland's
treatment as achieving greater success than any previous one, but the need
for some tolerable carbohydrate in the coeliac diet remained.
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><HR noshade SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+1"><B>Specific Carbohydrate Diet</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
Despite them remarkable success of Dr Howland's treatment with emphasis on
carbohydrate restriction, other doctors, distracted by the occurrence of
fatty stools continued to believe that dietary facts were at fault.  But
although there was some confusion resulting from this belief, there was a
steadily increasing recognition of the primary role of disordered
carbohydrate metabolism and digestion in causing coeliac disease.
<BR>
<BR>
Dr Sidney Valentine Haas, working with Dr Howland, was in full agreement
with Dr Howland's work but was interested in learning if some form of
carbohydrate could be added to the diet to hasten recovery and provide a
more varied and nutritious diet.  He had noted reports throughout the years
whereby children with severe diarrhoea had done very well on banana flour
(made of 70 per cent ripe banana) and plantain meal.  It was at the Home
for Hebrew Infants that Dr Haas first experimented with banana feeding [<A HREF="#ANCHOR07">7</A>].
 One of his patients was an infant who had difficulty in eating.  The baby
refused all food.  Dr Haas offered the baby a banana.  At that time, banana
was considered completely indigestible by a sick child.  Everybody was
horrified at the idea of feeding it to an infant everybody, that is, except
the infant, who not only took it but asked for more.  He was given more and
thus Dr Haas discovered the banana could be well tolerated.
<BR>
<BR>
He then decided to experiment with the banana, as the sought after
carbohydrate source, in the dietary treatment for coeliac.  He soon
discovered that coeliacs could tolerate this carbohydrate, and, more than
that, the banana could be fed in large quantities with beneficial effects. 
He further experimented with carbohydrate containing fruits and some
vegetables and found that they, too, could be tolerated and the coeliac
could regain health on a far more varied diet than just protein and fat.
<BR>
<BR>
During the next few years, Dr Haas treated over 600 cases of coeliac
disease with his Specific Carbohydrate Diet, maintaining his patients on it
for at least 12 months, and found that the prognosis of coeliac disease was
excellent.  
<FONT COLOR="#800080">
&quot;There is complete recovery with no relapses, no deaths, no
crisis, no pulmonary involvement and no stunting of growth.&quot;
</FONT>[<A HREF="#ANCHOR08">8</A>]
<BR>
<BR>
By 1949, Dr Sidney Haas's reputation was known throughout the world and on
April 5th of that year, more than 100 leading physicians met at the New
York Academy of Medicine to pay him tribute.  The New York Times reported:
<FONT COLOR="#800080">
Today, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of his entrance into the
medical profession, one of America's great pediatricians, Dr Sidney V Haas,
is being honored for his pioneer work in the field of pediatrics. Among Dr
Haas's most important accomplishments was in the treatment of celiac
disease, a digestive disturbance in which the child is intolerant of
starchy food, and which was generally fatal at the time of his original
work. Following his discovery that the carbohydrate in bananas could be
tolerated by celiac patients, Dr Haas developed an accepted routine therapy
which laid the basis for later research and basic treatment in this field.</FONT>
[<A HREF="#ANCHOR09">9</A>,<A HREF="#ANCHOR10">10</A>]
<BR>
<BR>
In 1951, Dr Haas, together with his son, Dr Merrill P Haas, published <I>The
Management Of Celiac Disease</I>, the most comprehensive medical text that had
ever been written on coeliac disease [<A HREF="#ANCHOR11">11</A>]. With 670 references to published
reports, the book described coeliac disease more completely than had ever
been done before.  The Drs Haas presented their success with the Specific
Carbohydrate Diet and offered their hypothesis in the last chapter of
their book as to why the diet was effective.  After decades of searching,
it appeared that not only was an effective and lasting dietary treatment
found, but that the Haas Specific Carbohydrate Diet was accepted by medical
colleagues throughout the world as a cure for coeliac disease.

<BR>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+1"><B>Protein vs. Carbohydrate Battle</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
But as Michael Crichton has written, &quot;the battle&quot; continued.  Within one
year after the publication of the Drs Haas's book, a singular report
appeared in the English medical journal <I>Lancet</I> [<A HREF="#ANCHOR12">12</A>].  A group of six
faculty members of the Departments of Pharmacology, Paediatrics and Child
Health of the University of Birmingham, after testing only 10 children,
decided that it was not the starch (carbohydrate) in the grains that so
many had reported as being deleterious, but it was the protein gluten in
wheat and rye flour that was causing coeliac symptoms.  They concluded
their  Lancet report by stating in their summary: <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080">
Gastro-intestinal function was investigated in 10 children with; coeliac
disease. The changes were very similar to those in adult idiopathic
steatorrhoea.  The removal of wheat flour from the diet resulted in rapid
improvement, both clinically and biochemically. Deterioration followed the
reintroduction into the diet of wheat flour or wheat gluten, but wheat
starch had no harmful effect.</FONT>
<BR>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+3" COLOR="#ff0000"><B>Did you know?</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+1" COLOR="#ff0000">
If you thought that sweetcorn was a gluten-free food, think again! Gluten is
one of the most important byproducts of maize, and bags of corn are sold as 
animal feed. In the making of cornflour, the hardest part is separating the 
gluten from the starch.<BR></FONT></CENTER>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<BR>
They contradicted all previous work by stating that there was no need to
restrict carbohydrates and, therefore, an unlimited choice of food could be
ingested, provided that wheat and rye gluten were excluded.  Further, 'a
high caloric diet may be given throughout with biscuits made from
cornflour, soya flour, or wheat starch instead of wheat flour.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
They maintained that it was not the starch in grains that was the culprit
but that it was the protein gluten and that when the gluten was 'washed
out&quot; of the flour, the remaining starch was perfectly fme.  And overnight,
the hypothesis gained ready acceptance.  No need now for doctors to worry
about adherence to a diet which eliminated specific carbohydrates found in
many foods; only one dietary exclusion would have to be made: the gluten in
wheat and rye flour.  No need to delve into food biochemistry and ask why
gluten-containing foods such as corn would be considered permissible; it
was to be a &quot;black and white&quot; remedy with no shades of grey.
<BR>
<BR>
Some patients showed remarkable clinical improvement in their general
well-being after following a &quot;gluten-free&quot; diet.  However, biopsy samples,
as viewed under
the microscope, showed intestinal cells that were still markedly abnormal
<A HREF="#ANCHOR13">13</A>.  In addition, some patients who started eating gluten suffered no ill
effects at one time but became extremely ill at other times.  Thus, not
only do different coeliac patients vary in their response to a gluten-free
diet but the same patient may vary from time to time [<A HREF="#ANCHOR14">14</A>].  <BR>
When the all
too common relapse occurs, the patient is most often told that he/she must
have inadvertently consumed gluten, and it is common for patients to become
so nervous about making a mistake that they assume that anything on a
product that begins with 'glut&quot; must be gluten: glutamic acid, glutamine,
monosodium glutamate, etc. Or that gluten had somehow crept into the food
in spite of the fact that it did not appear on the label.  	
<BR>
<BR>
It soon became apparent that grains which contained proteins other than
gluten were having deleterious effects on the digestive tract. Some
patients suffered relapses and exhibited damaged intestinal cells
(microscopically) upon eating soy products (<A HREF="#ANCHOR15">15</A>, <A HREF="#ANCHOR16">16</A>). 	Oats and barley were
found to contain gluten-like proteins which offended many coeliac sufferers
[<A HREF="#ANCHOR17">17</A>].additional reports 
implicated rice as well as other grains as being harmful to intestinal
cells (<A HREF="#ANCHOR18">18</A>, <A HREF="#ANCHOR19">19</A>).
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><HR noshade SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+1"><B>Restricted Diagnosis</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
But the diet to manage coeliac disease had been simplified and there now
remained the problem simplifying the diagnosis. It was decided that the new
diagnostic tool, the intestinal biopsy instrument, would be used to
identify coeliac. In spite of the symptoms the patient manifested, the
patient would not be diagnosed as a true coeliac until other criteria were
met.  A series of intestinal biopsies would be done: one tissue sample
would be taken from the small intestine before gluten was removed from the
diet; a second sample would be taken after the patient had been on a
&quot;gluten-free&quot; diet.  The biopsy samples would have to reflect the changes
in the diet.  When viewed under the microscope, the intestinal surface
would have to appear flattened or blunted while the patient ingested
gluten.  After gluten withdrawal, the intestinal surface would have to
revert to its normal architecture of &quot;hills and valleys&quot;.  If a patient
fulfilled these established criteria, his condition would then be given the
name 'gluten-induced enteropathy cocliac disease&quot;.  Thus, only a small
number of persons exhibiting the clinical symptoms of malabsorption
including diarrhoea, bloated belly, and failure to thrive could now be
classified as coeliacs.  The others, an even larger group, suffering with
the same symptoms (but who did not pass the required test using the
intestinal biopsy criteria) would be diagnosed as suffering from diarrhoea
from an unknown cause, steatoffhoea (fatty stools), malabsorption, sprue,
etc.  Therefore, if a physician applied the strict definition for
diagnosing coeliac disease, the number of &quot;true&quot; coeliacs would remain very
small while there would remain a large group of patients with assorted
diagnoses or no diagnosis of any kind [<A HREF="#ANCHOR20">20</A>].  In a recent review of coeliac
disease, the gastroenterologist writing the article referred to this method
of diagnosis as &quot;the current gold standard for diagnosis&quot; [<A HREF="#ANCHOR26">26</A>].
<BR>
<BR>
However, this method of diagnosis has been seriously questioned by a number
of specialists.  The flattened or blunted intestinal surface has been
reported in innumerable disease states: infectious hepatitis, ulcerative
colitis, parasitic infections of the intestine including various types of
worms and single-cell parasites, kwashiorkor [<A HREF="#ANCHOR21">21</A>], soy protein intolerance,
intolerance to cow's milk protein, intractable diarrhoea of infancy,
Crohn's disease [<A HREF="#ANCHOR22">22</A>] and bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine 
[<A HREF="#ANCHOR23">23</A>]. <BR>
Just about all conditions associated with diarrhoea seem to result in the
same appearance of the small intestine as is seen in the so-called &quot;true
coeliac&quot; [<A HREF="#ANCHOR20">24</A>, <A HREF="#ANCHOR20">25</A>].
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><HR noshade SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="+1"><B>Exceptions</B></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
And in spite of increasing numbers of sophisticated tests developed to
confirm the diagnosis of coeliac disease, including antibody tests, genetic
testing involving HLA (histocompatibility antigens) markers, and twin
studies, there appear to be more exceptions to the rule than those who
follow the rule.  The reality is that thousands of patients are suffering
and have never been given a diagnosis other than to see a psychiatrist, and
thousands of patients are following gluten-free diets and are getting
minimal relief, if any.  The following is part of an unsolicited letter to
the author, and her story is unfortunately only too common:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080">
After eight years of mysterious symptoms, dozens of doctors, gruelling and
often humiliating tests and general misery, no-one could decide what was
wrong with me.  I discovered that because my two sisters and my daughter
had been diagnosed as celiacs that I too should go on the gluten-free diet.
 Unfortunately for both my daughter, another sister and I, the gluten free
diet did not work.  Some symptoms were arrested but none of us were
thriving and we just weren't absorbing food.  We eventually found the
Specific Carbohydrate Diet and it has been a godsend.  I have never been
healthier.  My daughter, once a sickly (often whiney), withdrawn child with
thin hair and dark circles under her eyes is outgoing, rosy-cheeked and
happy.  Everyone has noticed her thick, shiny hair.  In fact she ran a
marathon this year and placed 15th out of 79 children.  Last year she ran
the same race (before the diet) and placed 53rd, arrived weepy and slept
all the way home in the car. </FONT>[<A HREF="#ANCHOR27">27</A>]
<BR>
<BR>
The Specific Carbohydrate Diet has been shown to completely cure most cases
of coeliac disease if followed for at least one year.  It is truly a
gluten-free diet, eliminating all grains which contain gluten or
gluten-like proteins while also recognising the limitations of the injured
intestinal surface.  For those people who are not satisfied with their
progress on the gluten-free diet, the specific carbohydrate diet offers
them the opportunity to become healthy.  In the concluding words of the
writer of the above letter:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080">
I have been on the specific carbohydrate diet for less than a year and
still have a way to go but my life has changed drastically in this short
time.  I have more energy, virtually no pain anywhere (before, my list of
symptoms was endless) and no longer spend half my life in the bathroom
where my life was literally going down the drain.  I was underweight, had
dry pale skin, dull looking eyes, suffered from hair loss and was generally
miserable. Now I am actively pursuing my art interest - something I always
had inside me, but didn't have the energy or drive to tackle.</FONT>
