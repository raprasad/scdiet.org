Subject: <B>Almond flour in 3 lb and 5 lb bags</B><BR>
From: nuts@concentric.net<BR>
Date: Sun, 30 Jan 2000 01:47:17 <BR><BR>
Dear Mik,<BR><BR>
I have noticed lot of people looking for smaller quantities of almond
flour. Please note that almond flour is now available in 3 lb for $ 9.95
and 5 lb for $15.95.<BR>
For more information visit the web site  <A HREF="http://www.almondsonline.com">www.almondsonline.com</A><BR><BR>

<BR>
PS: As I only
accept credit card it will be difficult for people from Europe and Australia
to use credit card to buy almonds as they will be unable to use their local
currency in the shopping cart on my web site and also probably it will cost
too much for shipping and handling.

          <B>Almond flour </B><BR>
          <BR>
          Yesterday I received my shipment of 25lbs of almond flour from the Hughson 
          Nut Co. in California. With shipment, it cost $101, and so came to $4/lb 
          for delivery to me here in Virginia. It lists for $3.50/lb FOB, and 
          the closer to CA you are the less will be the shipping. <BR>
          It is nearly white in color, and is MUCH finer than what you get from 
          running almonds through a Cuisinart machine. My only problem will be 
          storage. It should be O.K. in our relatively cool garage, but I am not 
          sure about storing this much flour in the summer without having a freezer. 
          <BR>

        <p>The phone number at Hughson is (209) 883-0403. <BR>

<B>Facts about the almond</B><BR>
<BR>
This little, well-tasting nut is pure and concentrated health:<BR>
Almonds contain more <B>vitamin E</B> than almost any other kind of food. There are 
24 mg vitamin E in a 100 grammes of almonds.
<BR>
There are numerous <B>minerals</B> in a concentrated form - especially magnesium, calium, phosphor, 
calcium.<BR>
Almonds also contains healthy <B>fat acids</B>. Almonds contain 39 grammes of fat pr. 100 grammes,
 equal to a fat energy percentage of 64, but if you don't have trouble with your weight, feel free 
to munch! Because the kind of fat in almonds is the healthy kind.<BR>
Almonds contain 9 grammes of <B>fibers</B> and 20 grammes of <B>protein</B> pr. 100 grammes.

<B>Nut flour</B><BR>
<BR>
I buy my ground nut almond flour at my local bulk food store.  I used to<BR>
buy a few kilograms at a time until I was sure that my system tolerated
it.<BR>
 Now I buy it in a twenty five pound box at a reduced price.  I freeze the<BR>
flour and use it as needed to make bread and muffins.  It is a good<BR>
replacement for the potatoes and the rice that you eat.  When I eat out
I<BR>
always take some bread, muffins and fruit with me.  I am also unable to<BR>
find the dry curd cottage cheese but instead I buy farmers cheese.<BR>
<BR>
Good health,<BR>

<B>Blanched almonds</B><BR>
<BR>
&gt;Is blanched almond the same as almond flour?<BR>
&gt;Nancy<BR>
<BR>
 To the best of my understanding, blanched almonds are<BR>
almonds without the skin.  Almond flour is ground almonds<BR>
which may or may not contain the skin.<BR>
<BR>
Catherine<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Blanched almonds are almonds with out their skins.  These can then be<BR>
ground up to make blanched almond flour.   When introducing almond flour
to<BR>
the diet it is best to use the blanched almond flour as the skins can be
an<BR>
irritant to our sensitive systems.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Some ideas on bread, etc.</B><BR>
Thu, 23 Jan 1997  1:53:29 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I'll reiterate for Bill Miller my experience with Hughson Nut<BR>
Company:<BR>
<BR>
I dealt with them once, and they were friendly and reliable.   They sell
a<BR>
minimum 25 lb. box for about $92.   (It's expensive, but they're the only<BR>
source I could find.)   When I called the number in the book<BR>
(209/883-0403), they had me send a check for $92.75 to their PO Box.   I<BR>
received the box two days later by UPS ground.     (I'm in the SF Bay Area,<BR>
only about 100 miles away.)  The 25 lb. box doesn't fit easily in my<BR>
fridge, so I store it at a friends place.<BR>
<BR>
If you haven't yet baked with the nut flour, it definitely makes this diet<BR>
more tolerable.    I find the muffins are the easiest to bake, and a couple<BR>
of them a day helped stabilize my weight.   (Try cutting them in half,<BR>
toasting them, and spreading butter or peanut butter on them.)   <BR>
<BR>
If you can get the DCCC, the &quot;Lois&quot; bread is also very good, especially
if<BR>
you toast it.    (It's not the same as whole wheat, but I'll get over it.)
<BR>
  It's harder (more time and prep) to bake, and, since it doesn't really<BR>
&quot;rise&quot; like wheat bread, one loaf doesn't last too long.    Since
I started<BR>
using a food processor, it comes out much smoother and more bread-like.
 <BR>
And if you cut the whole loaf in half, and then slice it sideways, the<BR>
slices are about the same size as regular bread.  <BR>
<BR>
Regarding recipes, as you may know, the SCD is often compared to the Atkins<BR>
diet which seeks to reduce or eliminate carbohydrates.   (The Atkins diet<BR>
is actually *very* different from the SCD, and even more controversial,
but<BR>
it's similiarities to SCD are interesting.)    Anyway, when I ran across
<BR>
&quot;Dr. Atkins's Quick and Easy New Diet Cookbook&quot; at a local bookstore,
I<BR>
picked it up to browse.   It has a few recipes that comply with SCD<BR>
guidelines, including some appealing ideas for vegetable dishes and sauces.<BR>
  At $12.95, I figure it's worth looking at.   <BR>

<B>Dutch Valley Pecan Meal</B><BR>
 Sun, 16 Feb 1997 20:22:43 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
As I mentioned a few weeks ago things have been going great for me until<BR>
this week.  I've been on the diet 9 months now.  The two things that are<BR>
different is that I ate grapes early in the week and I've been using the<BR>
Dutch Valley Pecan Meal.  I made some nut flour cookies and had about 4<BR>
of them the day that I ate a few grapes.  The next day I had quite a bit<BR>
of bowel activity.  I layed off the grapes but continued to eat the<BR>
cookies the next few days.  Things did not improve.  So I stopped eating<BR>
anything made with the nut flour and things have quieted down again.  Is<BR>
it possible that there is something in the nut flour that's not ok?  It<BR>
does taste a bit different than when I had ground pecans myself.  Anyone<BR>
else notice a problem with this flour?  <BR>
<BR>
Cheryl<BR>

&gt;Hi Cheryl,<BR>
<BR>
Read Terri Johnsons post about High Fibre foods. The Nut meal especially
as<BR>
cookies is really for the advanced people who have very little symptoms.<BR>
the dry gritty nature of nut meal can be a mechanical abrasive to the bowel<BR>
lining. Certainly if there is any grittiness in your stool after eating<BR>
nuts, avoid them until it heals completely. Even if there is not, eat them<BR>
with caution. try the white bean recipes in the mean time or try<BR>
substituting a portion of the nut flour for cooked white beans.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
To Cheryl,<BR>
<BR>
I use the Almond flour from Hughson, not the Pecan meal.   I've also begun 
to see a pattern of increased bowel activity when I eat muffins made with 
the flour.   It makes sense to me that Almond flour increases bowel 
activity - it definitely introduces more bulk into my diet.    Sometimes, 
along with the increase, I also have very difficult BMs which tire me out 
and seem to make my abdomen sore.   There's no blood or mucous, but it's 
bad enough for me to want to lie down for a half-hour.<BR>
<BR>
I don't yet have a clear pattern identified.   Sometimes I run out of 
muffins and take a few days before getting around to baking more.  It may 
be that the increased and unpleasant activity is due reintroducing the 
bulk.   I'm going to try to limit the volume of almond-flour foods, and 
keep it consistent.<BR>
<BR>
To Dave Johnson, regarding failed attempts to come off of Asacol:<BR>
 
I've been on the diet for almost four monthys, and I'm on Sulfasalazine.
 
When I've tried to ease off the drug, I have similar results - a return
of 
blood and mucous.   It's very frustrating, but I'll keep trying every 
couple of months.<BR>

<BR>
Greetings To Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
In the quest for better bread I called the Hughson Nut<BR>
Company to order their almond flour. The very good news<BR>
is that they grind it in an industrial flour mill, so it<BR>
becomes a powder. This is wonderful, I am presuming, for<BR>
baking breads that are not grainy and have less chance of <BR>
falling apart. I also have many recipes for sauces and soups <BR>
that call for the addition of &quot;roux&quot; which is a cooked <BR>
flour/butter mixture that thickens whatever you add it to.<BR>
<BR>
The down side (at least for me, being a single cook) is<BR>
they only ship in 25 lb. boxes! That's alot of flour!<BR>
I don't even know where I could store so much before it<BR>
spoils.<BR>
<BR>
The total cost for the box is $87.00 plus a $10.00 UPS 
charge.<BR>
<BR>
My question is...is there anyone who lives anywhere near<BR>
Madison, WI who would like to order a box and split it<BR>
with me? I would be happy to have it shipped to me, and<BR>
then I will split it and ship the rest to you, or vice<BR>
versa.<BR>
<BR>
Feel free to email me at cmroth@ix.netcom.com if you are<BR>
interested.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks!<BR>

<B>No roux from nuts</B><BR>
Tue, 25 Feb 1997 21:28:08 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Christina,<BR>
I just want to warn you that you can't make a roux with nut flour, no matter<BR>
how fine it is ground. Nuts are nuts, and flour which is used for thickening<BR>
sauces and such has gluten and/or starch, which gives it the thickening<BR>
property. Nut flour should actually not be called &quot;flour&quot; because
it's simply<BR>
finely ground nuts. The breads/cakes/muffins made with it will always be<BR>
somewhat grainy. You must realize the difference. Did you read my previous<BR>
post called &quot;bread details&quot;? I hope it can clarify things for
you about the<BR>
nut flour.<BR>

&gt;Regarding almond flour: Is it just ground up nuts, or is there something<BR>
&gt;added to it? I guess what I am wondering is iff I could just buy some<BR>
&gt;almonds and grind them up using my coffee grinder, which, under the
diet,<BR>
&gt;I won't be using anyhow...<BR>

<B>Walnuts</B><BR><BR><BR>

<BR>
<TT>&gt;I've read the discussion on using pecans and almonds for the nut <BR>

&gt;Thanks for any info.<BR>

I tried using walnuts once but they didn't grind very well. They seemed

<B>SCD:  walnuts</B><BR>
<BR>
Phyllis - Walnuts have more fat than almonds and so sometimes form <BR>
     butter rather than flour.  As far as the diet goes, both are allowed.
 <BR>
     Several of us are quite happy with the almond flour from the Hughson
<BR>
     Nut Co in California (209/883-0403).  It is $3.50 per pound plus <BR>
     shipping which varies across the country.  I pay $4.00 to get it to
me <BR>
     in Virginia.  That's a lot cheaper than buying whole almonds from a
<BR>
     health food store and doing your own grinding.   The flour we get from
<BR>
     Hughson is very fine.<BR>

<B>Re: using walnuts for nut flour</B><BR>
<BR>
Hi Phyllis,<BR>
I have not used walnut flour but love using walnuts as a base for fruit<BR>
smoothies and salad dressings, and chopped in salads. What I discovered
is<BR>
that it slows down my bowel movements...made me constipated...and that's
my<BR>
history. Not diarrhea. They have also been used for building physical<BR>
strength.<BR>
Most intestinal disorders in this group are characterized by diarrhea. I<BR>
wonder if the walnuts would be helpful in slowing down the motility of the<BR>
intestines.<BR>

<B>Re: roasted cashews</B><BR>
 Wed, 23 Apr 1997 23:40:43 GMT<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Hi, I know the book says no roasted cashews but why wouldn't roasted<BR>
&gt;cashews be allowed if the ingredients are only cashews, salt, and peanut<BR>
&gt;oil?  I bought some and now do not know if they would be ok.<BR>
<BR>

Heat applied to the oil in cashews, creates a horde of free radicals that
play havoc with the immune system. All nuts should be eaten raw if
possible, although I do find I tolerate cooked ones better from a
mechanical point of view. Another diet which includes nuts every day only
allows roasted nuts one meal per week in moderation as a treat.

<B>Peanut butter</B><BR>
<BR>
Peanut butter is a mouldy nut. You may have developed a mould allergy which<BR>
is indicative of a candida infection. Cut down on your sugar (honey) and<BR>
fruit intake eat more vegetables (like double) also avoid vinegar, yeast<BR>
and wine. Make sure you have good protein levels and try cashews instead.<BR>
They are a tree nut (no mould) also they are low in salicylates.<BR>

<B>Nuts &amp; Cholesterol</B><BR>

I remembered the discussion that has gone on from time to time about<BR>

<B>SCIENTIFIC UPDATE<BR>
The Latest Findings on Nuts, Diet, and Your Health</B><BR>
<BR>
An Australian study published by the American Journal of Clinical<BR>
Nutrition in 1994 compared the effect of both almonds<BR>
and walnuts on plasma lipids and heart disease outcome in 16 healthy<BR>
men. For 3 weeks half of the fat in the men's diet was<BR>
replaced with monounsaturated fatty acids from almonds, followed by a<BR>
3-week phase where polyunsaturated fatty acids from<BR>
walnuts were substituted. Total fat and calories were held constant.<BR>
Researchers discovered that both nuts were effective in<BR>
lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels. HDL &quot;good&quot; cholesterol
levels<BR>

walnuts each day (approximately 1/2 cup), a 5% drop in total and 9%<BR>

showed a 7% and 10% drop in total and LDL<BR>

<B>Grinding Nuts into Flour</B><BR>
Sat, 17 May 1997 15:58:11 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I don't know if anyone here is grinding their own nut flour, but it is an<BR>
option. A commercial flour can easily be contaminated with a gluten grain,<BR>
as one can't easily wash the machine between batches.<BR>
<BR>
For the PaleoFood list I did a little research on grinders. Nuts, being<BR>
oily, can't be ground in all grinders. I found out that there are three<BR>
types of grinders, but only one suitable for oily foods, the burr grinder.<BR>
A good description of the types can be found at:<BR>
<BR>
Which Grinder is Best For You? <A HREF="http://waltonfeed.com/grinder.html">http://waltonfeed.com/grinder.html</A><BR>
<BR>
and the price list for them is at: <A HREF="http://waltonfeed.com/grind.html">http://waltonfeed.com/grind.html</A><BR>
<BR>
In my correspondence with the fellow at Walton Feed we discussed the amount<BR>
of oil in nuts, as an impact grinder can handle ones that are &quot;low&quot;
in oil.<BR>
His list is:<BR>
<BR>
pecan (71.2% oil)<BR>
hichory nut (68.7%)<BR>
Brazil nut (66.9%)<BR>
walnut (60%)<BR>
almond (54.2%)<BR>
pistachio (53.7%)<BR>
beechnut (50%)<BR>
peanuts (47.5%)<BR>
cashew (41.7%)<BR>
neem (40%)<BR>
coconut (35.3%)<BR>
flax seed (35%)<BR>
candlenut (30%)<BR>
<BR>

Dear All,<BR>
Elaine wanted me to let you know that she got a call from Hughson nut<BR>
company to ask that we please be patient through the UPS strike.<BR>
Additionally they are reducing the price by .25 cents per pound for those<BR>
of us on the SCD diet because they &quot;beleive&quot; in what we are about. So<BR>
please mention this when you call.<BR>
If you are in a rush they will send through other carriers but it will cost<BR>
an additional $40 to $50 per carton.<BR>

We tried chestnut flour when we first put our son on the diet. We couldn't<BR>
find almond flour locally at first and we did find chestnut at the health<BR>
food store.<BR>
It is allowed, but it didnn't taste very good at all. We made 1 batch of<BR>
muffins with it. My son ate them, but he hadn't had any bread or cake for a<BR>
while, and would have eaten anything that looked like muffins. My wife and<BR>
I threw ours away when lunch time rolled around. We all like the breads and<BR>
muffins we make with almond flour though.<BR>

Subject: <B>Nutritional Info on Nuts</B><BR><BR>

I found a wonderfully detailed discussion on the nutrional value of nuts at:<BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.healthworld.com/library/books/haas/kitchen/nuts.htm">
http://www.healthworld.com/library/books/haas/kitchen/nuts.htm</A><BR><BR>

I thought about posting the article but decided it was too long.  If anyone
is interested but has trouble accessing the web, I'd be happy to email it.<BR><BR>

Almonds are 20% protein and 60% fat.  Pecans are 10% protein and 70% fat (the
lowest protein, highest fat nut).<BR><BR>

Personally, what I was looking for was the fat content of almonds.  The SCD
substitutes almond flour for regular flour and I'm trying to come up with a
straightforward way to make the substitution in a recipe.  I'm going to try
substituting the almond flour for regular flour 1 for 1 (for the volume), and
reducing fat/oil in the receipe by half that volume to account for the oil in
the almonds.<BR><BR>

Wish me luck!<BR><BR>

You can order a 25-lb box of almond flour from Hughson Nut's website
at:<BR>

<A HREF="http://www.hughsonnut.com/">http://www.hughsonnut.com/</A><BR><BR>

Click on the main page, then, on the next page, click where it says,
&quot;SCD Diet Information&quot; - you will arrive at on order form with a
special price for SCD-ers.  Many of us on this list have purchased
from them and are satisfied with their product, price, and service.<BR><BR>

Once your shipment arrives, the flour can be evenly divided among 5
1-gallon ziplock bags, and stored in your freezer (well, I keep one in
the refrigerator, replacing it as it's used up).<BR><BR>

Most seem to get their nut flour from Hughson Nuts, but it only comes in 25#

You can get as small amounts as 1# or 3# of blanched almond flour to test it
out first.  I'd go with atleast 3#.  It's more per pound though...You can also
call them at 1-800-NUTS4U2.  Good luck!<BR>

&gt; Was it nuts you ate that caused the problems, or cashews?  Cashews are<BR>

<BR>
To quote from my copy of the book (1995)...<BR>
<BR>
&quot;ALLOWABLE NUTS - Purchased with or without shells.<BR>
    Almonds, pecans, Brazil nuts, filberts (hazelnuts), walnuts,<BR>
    *unroasted cashews*, chestnuts.  Peanut butter, without additives<BR>
    of any kind.  *Roasted peanuts in the shell* may be be tried cautiously<BR>
    after being on the diet about six months when diarrhea is gone.  Avoid<BR>
    shelled peanuts as most have added starch.  Nuts sold in salted<BR>
    mixtures are nit permissible since most have been roasted with a<BR>
    starch coating.<BR>

Cashews and Peanuts are unique and may be a bad idea. Yes, even grown on 
trees cashews are technically a legume. As are peanuts. While these are 
SCD OK, they are specificaly recommended against for both parasites and 
candida, which is often accompanies (and maybe causes?) IBD. So, if you 
have concern about either of these complications, I'd stick to the true 
nuts. Almond butter, by the way, is good stuff. It's not peanut butter, 
but it is yummy.<BR>

Hi,<BR><BR>
I finally found a place in the Boston area that has Nut Flours.  I still order
mine from Hughson's and get it for I think $4/pound.  However, If I ever run
out I can buy it from this place to tide me over.  The name of the place is
Mixed Nuts in Belmont, Ma.  <BR>The phone number is 800-466-3022.  <BR>They carry all
kinds of nuts and nut flours, raw nuts, and dried fruits.  The Almond flour is
$7/pound I think.  That is pretty steep, but at least I know I can get it
locally if I really need it.  They have a website too at www.mixednuts.com.
If anyone knows of other places to get nut flours in the Boston area, please
post the info.

<BR>Hi Paula,
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>&gt; I make almond butter using the Hughson Nut flour by grinding it in the food
<BR>&gt; processor for a few minutes. It really is tasty--and sooo much more
<BR>&gt; economical than buying the jars that run about 10.00 here.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Ah, so *that's* why it tastes good ;-).  The almond butter (commercial) that
<BR>I've tasted didn't appeal to me, but I do like the nut flour, so can see that
<BR>it would make a nice thickener.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>&gt; Sometimes I add a small amount of honey and a touch of salt . This should
<BR>&gt; probably be eaten when you are alone, though, as on more than one occasion,
<BR>&gt; it actually caused my tastebuds to unexpectedly burst into song... &quot;Oh
<BR>&gt; sweet mystery of life, at last I've found youuuuuuuu.&quot; (embarrassing!)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Anyone who likes (good) food would understand ;-).  I can't wait to try the nut
<BR>flour butter route and end runny sauces!  As soon as I'm able to order from
<BR>Hughsons.....
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>First, it's nice to know Walnut Acres says they don't use starch, as
I've used some of their nuts.  However, I've only used the unroasted
ones.  In addition they once told me some bread they sold had no wheat
in it, and when I got it one of the first ingredients was wheat!!  Do
you have the statement in writing?  I wish I didn't have to ask that -
they seem like they should be trustworthy!
<BR><BR>
Also, as for roasting nuts on your own:  It's one more thing to do, but
I just did a big batch of 10 cups of them which should last me quite a
while.  I buy the nuts raw, soak them in water and 1 Tbs. sea salt per 4
C nuts.  The book I have recommends 6 hrs or less of soaking for
cashews, 7 or more hrs for other nuts.  I then drained them, mixed in
some more salt so I'd have a salted roasted nut mixture, and roasted
them at 200-250 degrees F for 12 -24 hours.  They are wonderful.  (These
directions come from the Nourishing Traditions cookbook, which I've
found quite informative and useful.)

<BR>Melissa,
<BR>Try Walnut Acres (800-433-3998 or 
<A HREF="http://www.walnutacres.com">www.walnutacres.com</A>) for cashews. 
 They have verified to me that they do not add any starch to their nuts
 during the roasting stage.<BR>

<BR>Melissa,<BR>
<BR>I make my own roasted nut butter.  I take my almond nut flour and spread it on
 a cookie sheet about 1/2 inch thick.  I put it on a rack in the middle of the
 oven at 325 degrees for about 10 minutes or until lighly browned.  You have to
 stir the nuts around every few minutes so they can brown evenly and not burn.
 Then I put them in a food processor that works great for nut butter (Cuisinart
 Little Pro Plus), and grind them down to a very creamy consistency.  I use
 broken raw cashew bits and cook the same way.  Sometimes if the nut mixture
 looks a little dry or grainy after being blended a while I add about a
 tablespoon of oil (usually flaxseed, or sunflower, olive oil would taste to
 overpowering), and blend a little longer.  The cashew is so creamy and
 delicious.  From my experience, I sometimes have a slight problem if I eat to
 much of the almond butter or almond bread but never with the cashew butter.
<BR>Too make your own is definitely cheaper and at least you know what's in it.
<BR>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

<P>Roz,
<P>My quick recipe for cashew butter:
<P>Place broken raw cashew bits one layer thick on cookie sheet.  (I use broken
bits because they are so much cheaper)  Bake in oven at 325 F for about 10-15
minutes or until light brown.  Every few minutes turn the nuts so they evenly
brown and don't burn. Remove from oven and place in good food processor.  I
use a Cuisinart Little Pro Plus.  As you grind the nuts, stop the grinder from
time to time to scrape down any nuts that have built up on the sides.  After a
few minutes add a tablespoon or so of some allowable oil.  I use flax oil or
sunflower.  Continue grinding and in about 5 minutes you have the creamiest
nut butter you will ever experience!  Be careful, it is very addicting!<BR>
Enjoy, Lois

<BR>
<BR>All this talk about nut roasting got me thinking about a dish that we used
<BR>to have every year with our holiday turkey dinners back in Texas when I was
<BR>hardly knee-high to chigger: parched pecans. These are simple,and they
<BR>don't take hours of roasting time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Melt a little butter in a sauce pan. Put the pecans into the pan and coat
<BR>them with butter. Salt them lightly. Spread nuts on a cookie sheet, and put
<BR>them into the oven at about 300 to 350 degrees F (140-180 C). Keep checking them until
<BR>they are noticeably darker and have shrunk (You want to take most of the
<BR>moisture out of them, and they will shrink as a result). It wont take that
<BR>long, but I've never timed it. It's ok if they look a little burnt even,
<BR>they'll taste great. Try them as a side dish in place of the potatos and
<BR>rice and corn you used to think you couldn't live without.<BR>
