<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Lentils</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
The main cause for problems with lentils is the way they are cooked. The
red ones need little soaking really, but you could try the following the
instructions for best results:<BR>
<BR>
Wash the lentils or beans<BR>
Soak overnight - DONT oversoak!! beans are not like yoghurt. More is NOT<BR>
better. Once the enzyme inhibitors are deactivated sufficiently, changes
in<BR>
the molecular structure take place that make the bean actually less<BR>
digestible. (for us)<BR>
Drain off water<BR>
Cover with a very generous quantity of fresh water (like for pasta - about<BR>
4-5 times volume of beans)<BR>
Now this is the key to good beans -: Boil hard on high heat for 10-15 mins<BR>
scooping the scum that forms off the top. Boil for longer if scum continues<BR>
to form.<BR>
<BR>
Top up the pot with additional water to last the full simmer time<BR>
Now you can turn the heat down for the remainder of the cooking time.<BR>
Beans are cooked when they collapse under soft pressure between finger and<BR>
thumb. Do Not Add Salt until cooked. Salt makes the skins tough and<BR>
consequently harder to digest.<BR>
<BR>
The following times are given as a guide. The first time given is the Rapid<BR>
Boil time, the second is the time for simmering<BR>
<BR>
Soak overnight<BR>
<BR>
Lima Beans   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                           15-20/45-75mins<BR>
Red Kidney Beans   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15-20/30-35mins<BR>
Navy/White Haricott Beans  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15-20/35-45mins<BR>
Whole Green and Brown Lentils       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     15-20/15-30mins<BR>
Whole Green Peas                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        15-20/45-75mins<BR>
<BR>
No soaking required<BR>
<BR>
Whole Red Lentils       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 10-15/5 mins<BR>
Split Green/Brown Lentils      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          10-15/5-20mins<BR>
Split Peas               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                10-15/30-35mins<BR>
<BR>
For those with pressure cookers the first number represents the cooking<BR>
time with the lid off the second with the lid on. (lid off cooking first,<BR>
reduces frothing with the lid on)<BR>
<BR>
Soak overnight<BR>
<BR>
Lima Beans                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             15/20-25mins<BR>
Red Kidney Beans          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               15/10-15mins<BR>
Navy/White Haricott Beans      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          15/15mins<BR>
Whole Green and Brown Lentils        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    15/7-10mins<BR>
Whole Green Peas             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            15/20-25mins<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Whole Red Lentils, Split Lentils, Split Peas - The cooking times for these<BR>
products are already short and do not really benefit from pressure cooking<BR>
<BR>
Troubleshooting Notes:<BR>
<BR>
Beans are better undersoaked than oversoaked<BR>
and better overcooked than undercooked<BR>
If beans are overcooked, Do Not reduce the initial Rapid Boil time, reduce<BR>
the simmer time<BR>
<BR>
Happy bean eating<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Thanks Micheal for the info on beans, I've been thinking about adding
beans<BR>
&gt;to the diet, and this is just what I needed to get started.  To tell
the<BR>
&gt;truth, I've never had any luck cooking beans, so I'm not too excited
about<BR>
&gt;cooking them, but they are probably the food I miss the most, so I guess<BR>
&gt;I'm stuck.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;But I have a question.  Why is the instruction always &quot;soak overnight&quot;
when<BR>
&gt;almost no one eats beens for breakfast (of course some of my favourite<BR>
&gt;breakfasts, in my pre-diet days, always included some spicy bean and
egg<BR>
&gt;concoction) -- or does the instruction mean soak overnight and into
the<BR>
&gt;next evening?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Bill</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Well, White beans and Tahini; white beans and almond meal; white beans and<BR>
cashew butter; and lentils and tahini are all  balanced breakfasts that
I<BR>
have been enjoying for the past 2 weeks. Since I stopped fruit and tried<BR>
this, my BM's have improved greatly.I'm going to venture back to some<BR>
stewed fruit soon.<BR>
Soak overnight means soak for about 8-10 hours. For most people this is<BR>
most convenient to do overnight, you know &quot;put the cat, the beans and
the<BR>
garbage out&quot;. Then they cook them in the morning and bake, stir fry
or whip<BR>
into a dip the following evening. I personally try to cook a big batch and<BR>
freeze some or at least put a few trays in the fridge, where they'll keep<BR>
for at least 3 days.<BR>
<BR>
I recommend you get either a pressure cooker for speed or a big big big<BR>
stock pot for doing quantities. It's the time that they take to cook that<BR>
deters me most. cooking more at a time, means you have to do it less often,<BR>
but I don't like freezing things because you then have the hastle of<BR>
defrosting them, and beans kind of loose their texture when you freeze them<BR>
after being cooked. however I'm told you can soak them and then freeze them<BR>
ready to cook and that this shortens the cooking time (probably because
it<BR>
breaks the structure of the bean apart as the water within the bean expands<BR>
as it turns to ice.) I've never tried it and once again, I don't like<BR>
freezing things because it would take just as long to defrost them<BR>
naturally as it does to soak them freshly.<BR>
<BR>
Beans are best cooked twice, they develop more flavour that way, but you<BR>
can make dips out of boiled beans, drained and pureed with lemon juice,<BR>
paprika, salt, tahini and crushed garlic. Try that for starters. Also any<BR>
cooked white beans, tahini and dill is my emergency snack when nothing else<BR>
is ready. Go lightly on the tahini. just enough to flavour the beans about<BR>
4or5 parts beans to 1 part tahini.<BR>
<BR>
Enjoy!!<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">&gt;Hi Michael,<BR>
&gt;Thanks for the great info on beans. What I always wanted to know about<BR>
&gt;beans but was always afraid to ask. How long should the beans be soaked?
I<BR>
&gt;usually let mine go 24 hrs. Is that too long? Thanks Sheila</FONT><BR>
<BR>
about 3 times too long. try 8-10hrs then cook them straight away (don't
let<BR>
them sit around because they are now alive and changing within. They become<BR>
more indigestible every minute. so pop them in the pot fast.<BR>

&gt;I have Scala's book, and I also seem to have problems with *some* of
the<BR>
&gt;foods he suggests are likely to cause problems. I also have trouble
with beets<BR>
&gt;(Scala  says most of his survey subjects do), and note that beets are
an<BR>
&gt;ingredient in the V8 juice recommended by SCD.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
Beets are highly cleansing. Norman Walker in his book Raw Vegetable Juices<BR>
say to juice not more that a wine glass full. I juiced a pint once and<BR>
immediately got a migraine. I believe it was cleansing my liver.<BR>

Dear ripogenu,<BR>
I asked Elaine about horseradish, and she said it is OK as long as it
doesn't have any added ingredients.<BR>

   How do you make homemade spaghetti?  I would appreciate your recipe.<BR>

     The important thing is the tomato sauce.  I take a large can of tomato

     juice from the supermarket - it has to be one without any corn syrup
- 
     and put it in a large pot to boil slowly.  This is because you need
to 
     reduce it in volume so as to be more thick.  Then you can brown some

     low fat ground meat and add that.  You can also add one or two fresh

     tomatoes cut up in small pieces.  Then I dice one onion and saut&Egrave;
it 
     in olive oil, and add that.  Also, smash a couple of garlic cloves

     with the flat edge of a large kitchen knife, dice and add that to the

     pot.  You can add a couple of bay leaves, some ground oregano and 
     basil, ground black pepper, salt, and whatever other spices you like.

     All this needs to boil slowly for at least one hour.  You will get
a 
     feel for how long based on the thickness of the liquid.  I find that

     it makes enough for 3-4 meals, so I divide it into single serving 
     plastic bowls.<BR>

     Luckily the spaghetti squash is in the stores year-round.  I slice
one 
     in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds, and put it in a steamer for

     about 20 minutes.  You can also put it face down in a pan with an inch

     of water in a medium oven.<BR>
     <BR>
     I also grate some hard parmesan cheese for a topping.  I don't believe

     we are supposed to use the already grated kind.<BR>

<BR><BR>
 <B>Lacto-fermented condiments?</B><BR>
Tue, 14 Jan 1997 22:13:12 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I do not have any ibd...but am researching this diet for a chapter on<BR>
digeston I am writing. I have posted a few queries about digestive enzymes
here.<BR>
<BR>
anyway, I decided to make some lacto-fermented saurkraut as recommended
by<BR>
Sally Fallon in her book Nourishing Traditons. She says it is the king of<BR>
digestive enzyme condiments and has been a staple of other cultures'<BR>
&quot;nourishing traditions.&quot; This saurkraut is why Germans can eat
fatty meat<BR>
and potatoes day after day and not drop dead of a heart attack. I made up
a<BR>
batch and tasted...it explodes with energy! I have never tasted or<BR>
experienced anything like it ever. My diabetic friend was fainting from
too<BR>
much sugar and she had a bite and bounced back INSTANTLY. Every one I've
let<BR>
taste it lights up and exclaims, WOW!<BR>
<BR>
These are the elements. If you all think it would work on your diet, I will<BR>
give you the recipe. I'm not sure the specific spices are necessary, but
did<BR>
it ever taste GOOD! The idea is you eat only a few bites with meals...not
a<BR>
full portion. Also, it's supposed to be even better when aged a few months<BR>
in cold storage.<BR>
<BR>
Cabbage shredded<BR>
sea salt (a few tsp)<BR>
a tsp of whey...I used liquid from yogurt<BR>
mustard or mustard seeds (I used prepared mustard for the above batch)<BR>
junpier berries (gives an astringent taste)<BR>
cumin seeds (or powdered)<BR>
Filtered water.<BR>

<B>Hi Carol</B><BR>
<BR>
I found your information on saurkraut interesting especially since I<BR>
learned recently that lactic acid fermented vegetables, lacto-fermented<BR>
saurkraut being one, are an excellent source of acidophilus.  They are a<BR>
great supplement to out diet and can be bought in health food stores.  If<BR>
anyone is having problems tolerating the yogurt this is an good alternative<BR>
way of providing the body with the &quot;good&quot; bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
Good health<BR>
<BR>
Amanda
