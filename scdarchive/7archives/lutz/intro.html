<B> Foreword to the First English Edition</B><BR>
<BR>
Wolfgang Lutz's book &quot;Life Without Bread&quot; has been in German editions
and is now available in an English version. Although its provocative theories
have found not only agreement but also opposition it nevertheless always
offers stimulating reading. The twentieth century has been dominated by
the &quot;lipid theory&quot; of arteriosclerosis. This theory assumes that
the leading causes of death (heart attacks and strokes) which are complications
of arteriosclerosis are adversely affected by lipids such as cholesterol
and saturated (animal) fats but are counteracted by unsaturated vegetable
fats. The theory is accepted by leading scientific organizations and supported
by powerful commercial interests.<BR>
<BR>
Lutz's ideas have challenged the lipid theory which also some others (like
myself) believe to be built a sand.<BR>
<BR>
Lutz's treatment of the subject of carbohydrates vs. protein and fat consumption
is quite ingenuous. He studied the evolutionary development of food consumption
and concluded that during the past 5,008 years a relatively sudden change
has occurred by the introduction of high amounts of starches. On this basis
he favours the return to the earlier practices to which Man was accustomed.
He claims that a protein-fat diet has advantages in the treatment of many
conditions.<BR>
<BR>
Lutz's approach is controversial but his ideas deserve to be tested.<BR>

Foreword to the Fifth German Edition<BR>
<BR>
The first edition of this book appeared in 1967. It was a courageous feat,
at a time when fat was held to be responsible for coronary infarction and
many other diseases, to recommend the restriction of nutritional carbohydrate
to 60 - 70 grams per day. An organization supported by the German government
had even stated, without offering plausible supporting evidence, that an
office employee &quot;requires&quot; 350 grams of carbohydrate daily ...
Lutz stirred up a hornet's nest! In the ensuing years evidence from other
sources and his own extensive experience have confirmed the value of his
concept.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Leben ohne Brot&quot; has become almost a slogan and the appearance
of this fifth edition is convincing evidence of the impact caused by Lutz's
ideas on the medical and lay public.<BR>
<BR>
This book is intended primarily but not exclusively for the medical profession.
Observations on his own person combined with clinical experience were the
starting point for the &quot;Life without Bread&quot; programme. Even those
who can not entirely accept Lutz's concepts and hypotheses regarding pathogenesis
cannot afford to ignore this book. Clinical observations cannot be talked
out of existence nor should they be dismissed simply because they conflict
with one's own theories. The value of a diet can only be judged on the basis
of clinical experience and practical success, and does not depend upon biochemical
and physiological explanations.<BR>
<BR>
Lutz's book challenges physicians to gather data on a &quot;Life without
Bread&quot;. It is an appeal to us to document results in the prophylaxis
and therapy of adiposity, peptic ulcers, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis,
arteriosclerosis and coronary infarction as well as to record our form of
diet on which mankind lived for at least 2 millions years.<BR>

Foreword to the Ninth German Edition<BR>
<BR>
Undoubtedly it is a special achievement when a practicing physician and
doctor of internal medicine develops, without governmental support, a new
form of therapy which is very successful even without the aid of the surgeon's
scalpel or the pharmacist's chemistry. It goes without saying that a physician
should offer his patients the benefit of every possible approach, i.e. a
stimulating climate, physical exercise or dietary change, before he prescribes
any medication or refers the patient to a surgeon.<BR>
<BR>
Initially, Wolfgang Lutz had felt purely intuitively, without knowing the
theoretical reasons, that excessive eating of quickly-metabolized carbohydrates
-- sugar and starch --- is incompatible with the extreme physical inactivity
of modern Man. Glucose is essential for higher evolved organisms as the
efficient systems of gluconeogenesis and regulation document. These reactions
maintain the blood sugar level essential for life. However, the surplus
of carbohydrates combined with minimal physical activity can throw the finely-tuned
endocrine system off balance, and lead to secondary false regulations. Whole
tissue complexes can thereby lose their function; even minimal stress can
lead to pathological processes.<BR>
<BR>
Lutz has identified and summarized very nicely the &quot;regulatory diseases&quot;
which respond to carbohydrate restriction. Furthermore, he was the first
to describe the endocrine events which underlie these disorders. Generally
his view coincides with the basic metabolic regulation we have postulated
based on experimental results we have, therefore in cooperation with Prof.
Peter Sallmann, reproduced the chicken experiments published by Lutz, Andresen,
and Buddecke, and arrived at the same conclusion, namely: the spontaneous
arteriosclerosis of chickens is definitively less developed when carbohydrates
are replaced by isocaloric amounts of fat or protein. The quality of the
fat is of secondary importance.<BR>
<BR>
In further experiments we were able to demonstrate that the rates of tumor
growth in experimental animals which follow the application of carcinogens,
diminish significantly when carbohydrates are replaced by the isocaloric
amount of fat. This can be interpreted as a generally-increased stress tolerance
of all body cells and by intensified immune mechanisms, whereby the developing
tumour cells are eliminated more efficiently.<BR>
<BR>
These results indicate that in addition to tobacco abstinence, a low carbohydrate
nutrition is the right prophylaxis against arteriosclerosis, coronary infarct
and cancer, since adequate physical exercise becomes more and more difficult
to realize in today's metropolitan life-styles. The same goes for diseases
of the gastric intestinal mucosa, to name only a few examples. <BR>
<BR>
One should wish this book, already in its 9th edition, extensive distribution.
Every physician should read it and add the simple alternative of carbohydrate
restriction to his therapeutic repertoire. However, this book is written
in a way that the lay-person also can profit from the valuable suggestions
for his own nutrition, and particularly for the nutrition of his/her children.
A low-carbohydrate diet keeps teeth healthy more efficiently than brushing
them several times a day. With this example I wish the best to &quot;Life
without Bread&quot;.<BR>

Preface to the first English Edition<BR>
<BR>
The original title of this book when it was published in German in 1967
was &quot;Leben ohne Brot&quot; (&quot;Life without Bread&quot;) --- &quot;Bread&quot;
in this case meaning (Editor's Question: refined ???) carbohydrates of all
kinds. The objective was to convince the reader that carbohydrate foodstuffs
were detrimental to health.<BR>
<BR>
When Robert Atkins' book &quot;Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution&quot; was published
in 1972 it immediately became a best-seller. Atkins' success aroused the
interest of the medical profession, which still adhered firmly to the theory
that animal fats were the culprits eventually leading to heart disease and
stroke. Atkins was attacked by the American Medical Association and required
to give testimony in defense of his ideas before the (US government's) &quot;Senate
Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs&quot;,<BR>
<BR>
This bad experience of Atkins emphasized the lack of scientific basis for
the dogma of health on a low-carbohydrate diet. Since the appearance of
Stefansson's book &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; in 1957 many authors have
proposed a diet of this nature for reducing weight. Despite a number of
reports of relief in conditions such as high blood pressure, heartburn and
arthrosis, the low-carbohydrate diet has remained solely a remedy for obesity.
Nowhere was the suggestion made that it is Man's natural mode of nutrition,
and thus the ideal diet not only for the healthy, but also for sufferers
of every type of ailment.<BR>
<BR>
I have adhered to this diet myself, and have observed for over 26 years
its effects on well over 10,000 patients. During this time so many hitherto
unknown scientific facts have accumulated in support of the belief that
&quot;Life without Bread&quot; is universally beneficial that I feel obliged
to publish my results. It is my hope that this book will provide support
for those already extolling the virtues of the diet, and that it will offer
valuable information to my colleagues and to everyone whose aim is a longer
and healthier life.<BR>
<BR>
I hope that this first English edition will clear the way for a discussion
of carbohydrates as the cause for diseases of civilization. This quest is
likely to succeed since the lipid theory, which has dominated the minds
of medical scientists for the past several decades, has dug its own grave.
The huge and very costly epidemiological studies have indeed demonstrated
that the blood-cholesterol level is somehow prognostic for the occurrence
of heart attacks.<BR>
<BR>
However, the subsequent intervention trials were hardly effective.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently, a diet poor in fat and cholesterol can lower the incidence of
heart attacks to a small degree but has little influence on the overall
mortality. A population which feeds on a diet that contradicts the evolutionarily-evolved
nutritional composition will have to face many privations with little or
no gain in health status.<BR>
<BR>
We will have to leave the beaten track of animal fat and cholesterol restriction
and remember that essentially we are still what we were when we emerged
from the paleolithic era and began to conquer the earth: hunters, or at
best hunters and gatherers. Our physiology had no time to change fundamentally
in the following few thousand years; our body is still adapted to the consumption
of proteins and lipids.<BR>
<BR>
Consequently, the contemporary intake of carbohydrates is harmful --- exceeding
the amount a paleolithic gatherer could carry home.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this English edition will help to change the minds of medical scientists
and eventually revise the nutritional views of the general population.<BR>
<BR>
The best way of convincing a layman of the correctness of an idea is by
an experiment Involving his own person. I can give an almost certain promise
that scarcely anyone will not discover some kind of improvement in his well-being.
The physicians is in a simple position, for he needs only incorporate this
form of nutrition in his therapeutic repertoire, and will find that he has
never had so many grateful patients!<BR>
<BR>
He will, however, have to reckon with difficulties again and again. I will
point out that the effect of a low carbohydrate diet is dependent upon two
processes opposed to each other. On the one hand, there is an improvement
in the quality of tissues and organs, and on the other hand forces originating
in the immune system are mobilized are directed against the body's own organs
(auto-aggression). Since, unbeknownst to us, immune diseases of this kind
may be latent within us, it is strongly recommended that a low carbohydrate
diet should be supervised by a physician if any disturbing symptoms exist
or develop.<BR>
<BR>
Since a &quot;Life without Bread&quot; involves a number of medical measures
I want to address myself at this point to my professional colleagues, particularly
the younger generation. Perhaps with the eagerness for new ideas that is
characteristic of youth they may even be prepared to abandon the older theories.<BR>
<BR>
It is my hope and conviction that sooner or later clinics and research establishments
will approach research in human nutrition with an open mind, unhampered
by preconceived ideas. I have no doubt that an approach of this kind would
bring additional confirmation of the observations described in this book.
Despite the difficulties connected with a change of diet in sick adults,
a restriction of carbohydrate is in many cases the only hope left. And furthermore,
it provides us with a basis for successful treatment of diseases of civilization.<BR>
<BR>
I appeal here to clinicians to collect exact data on their patients and
in animal experiments. It is not enough to talk about different types of
diet and to leave it to others to discover whether a particular diet leads
to alterations in physiological values or brings improvements in health
or even a prolongation of life. Measurements of this kind are reported in
this book.<BR>
<BR>
Anyone who has found himself in the position of an outsider trying to penetrate
the sacred precinct of established scientific theory will appreciate the
difficulties that I have encountered. That it was possible at all is due
to Dr. med. Erdmuthe Idris, who considered the manuscript of an unknown
author to be suitable for publication, thus bringing it to the notice of
the German medical world.<BR>
<BR>
As regards the scientific side of the work involved, I warmly acknowledge
the cooperation of Prof. Dr. Juergen Schole, Hannover, West Germany; of
Dr. Heinrich Isel-stoeger, Wien, Austria; and Prof. Dr. Kurt Eckel, Bad
Ischl; and in particular the assistance of Prof. Dr. Dr. Guenther Weitzel
and Prof. Dr. Eckhard Buddecke of the Institutes of Physiological Chemistry
in Tuebingen and Muenster (West Germany). In Professor Weitzel I found a
ready listener when, as a physician completely unknown to him, I approached
him with my idea that humans as well as chickens were led away from their
original mode of nutrition with the introduction of carbohydrates by agriculture,
and that this might be the explanation for the similar forms of arteriosclerosis
seen in the two species. He willingly and generously placed his experience
and the facilities of his institute at my disposal. Prof. Buddecke has assisted
me in the continuation and completion of these experiments.<BR>
<BR>
My thanks finally go to Mrs. Beatrice Idris-Duncan, San Raphael, CA, USA;
Mrs. Joy Wieser, lnnsbruck, Austria, for this expert translation, and to
Dr. Erdmuthe Idris, Planegg near Munich. Without her taking interest in
this book it would not have appeared.<BR>
