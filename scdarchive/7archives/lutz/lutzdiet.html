&gt;I hope this is the right place to write you re this request: I <BR>
&gt;wonder if you could say exactly what Lutz's diet is (as opposed to the <BR>
&gt;general remarks you've made about it:  low-carbo, like Gottschall's but <BR>
&gt;not as good -- how not as good? -- I think this was in one of the SCD <BR>
&gt;posts). <BR> 
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Lutz's diet is interesting to me <BR>
&gt;because it's backed by years of clinical experience, which I think would <BR>
&gt;make it stronger than Elaine's (as she's not, I gather, a clinician), so <BR>
&gt;to me the fact that he allows &quot;some bread&quot; (again, from one of your SCD <BR>
&gt;posts) is interesting and significant.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;If you do develop some more detailed account of his actual diet in <BR>
&gt;English, I expect you'd want to post it on the SCD list.  If you'd like <BR>
&gt;to reply to me personally, I am<BR>

Chapter III, Outline of a Low-Carbohydrate Diet<BR><BR>

It is difficult to reflect the vast diversity of dietary habits in
specific recipes or menues. Therefore, one has to inquire occasionally
about the patient's diet and together with the patient recalculate the
carbohydrate proportion in the patients average daily food intake.<BR><BR>


<B>Chapter III, Outline of a Low-Carbohydrate Diet</B><BR><BR>

<B>Principle:</B><BR>
=======<BR>
Restriction of sugar and starch<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Permitted:</B><BR>
========<BR>
Fish, all sorts of meat, also canned, smoked, sausage, cold cuts, liver,
cheese, eggs, sour cream, yoghurt, sour milk, all kinds of animal and
plant fats and oils, also pork grease, butter and run butter (plant fats
like oils and margarine are certainly not any healthier than animal
fats), salads, leaves and stems of vegetables (aspargus, Brussels
sprouts, cauliflower, lettuce, cabbage), cucumbers and tomatoes in
reasonable amounts.<BR><BR>

Furthermore, unsweetened and alcoholic beverages, salt, if not
specifically restreicted, are permitted.<BR><BR>

These foods can be prepared according to preference (boiled, fried,
baked, roasted, steamed) or consumed raw. Small amounts of crumbs and of
flour for sauces and vegetables are free; larger amounts have to be
included in the restricted amount. To sweeten one uses either sugar and
calculates 12 g per unit or one uses artificial sweeteners. However, one
quicly gets used to unsweetened foods and beverages.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Restricted:</B><BR>
=========<BR>
All carbohydrate-containing foods (starch, sugar) as listed in the
following table of equivalency are permitted. Only 6 bread units (BU) of
these foods are to be eaten per day.<BR><BR>

1 BU is equivalent to a half bread roll or the following:<BR>
12 g sugar or starch<BR>
14 g honey<BR>
15 g flour, semolina, rice, oats, flakes, corn, potato flour, pudding<BR>
powder, sago, grits, pasta, bread crumbs, peeled barley, soup or sauce<BR>
powder, crispbread, bisquits<BR>
20 g white bread, chokolate<BR>
25 g dark bread<BR>
30 g Graham bread, whole-meal bread, Pumpernickel, peas, lentils, beans<BR>
(dry weight)
40 g cocoa<BR>
60 g potatoes, bananas, nuts, viper's grass<BR>
80 g sweet fruit (pears, grapes, sweet apples)<BR>
90 g fresh green peas<BR>
100 g orange or apple juice<BR>
120 g sour fruit (oranges, sour apples, etc) and berries<BR>
120 g lemon juice<BR>
200 g vegetables roots, string beans, etc.<BR>
250 g (1/4 liter) beer, wine, etc.<BR>
330 g sweet milk (whole or skim)<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><B>
Example of a low-carbohydrate menu with 6 BU:</B><BR><BR>

Breakfast:<BR>
1 cup of coffee or tea without sugar<BR>
2 soft boiled eggs,<BR>
half bread roll or 25 g of bread    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          = 1 BU<BR><BR>

Morning snack: cheese with butter        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   = 0 BU<BR><BR>

Lunch:<BR>
meat or fish with vegetables, salad, spinach, aspargus, etc.<BR>
120 g of potatoes or 30 g of rice or noodles (dry weight), or small
pastry containing no more than 15 g of flour and 12 g of sugar, or 250 g
of fruit       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  = 2 BU<BR><BR>

Afternoon:<BR>
coffee or tea without sugar               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;         = 0 BU<BR><BR>

Dinner:<BR>
cold cuts, cheese, eggs, etc. with 50 g of bread or 1 bread roll,<BR>
1/4 liter of wine or beer                 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;         = 3 BU<BR><BR>
                                                               - - - - -<BR>
Total amount :                                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          = 6 BU<BR><BR>
