NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1">Wolfgang Lutz was born in 1913 as the son of a 
        general practioner. He studied medicine in Vienna and Innsbruck and after 
        his graduation joined the medical staff at the II. Medizinische Universitaetsklinik 
        in Vienna.<BR>
 There he published several studies on the absorption of dyes and on the enterohapatic circulation.<BR>
 When working at a medical research institute in Germany, Lutz sutdied problems of sudden drop 
 pressure during high altitude flights (decompression atelectasis) and aspects of cooling and death 
 from exposure.<BR>
 As highlight of this work he was able to resuscitate warmblooded animals even after 60 minutes of 
 continuous cardiac arrest and a body temperature of nearly zero celcius.<BR>
 <BR>
 Lutz habilitated in 1943 at the University of Vienna School of Internal Medicine.<BR>
 <BR>
 After the war Lutz established himself in a referral practice in a small town in Austria. As 
 described in his book, in 1958 he came into contact with nutritional problems and to the conviction 
 that carbohydrates in the civilized diet play a special pathogenetic role. <BR>
 This concept he has not abandoned since; it lead to the present universal theory of carbohydrates as 
 chief vermins for civilized mankind. Lutz now practices internal medicine in Salzburg.
