Reply-To:     Paleolithic Diet Symposium List &lt;PALEODIET@MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU&gt;<BR>
From:         Loren Cordain &lt;cordain@CAHS.COLOSTATE.EDU&gt;<BR>
Subject:      <B>Re: Response to molecular mimicry comments</B><BR>
<BR>
    In the human immune system, there are a number of individual mechanisms<BR>
which allow the body the ability to determine self from non self so that
foreign <BR>
proteins (i.e. bacteria, viruses etc) can be recognized, destroyed and <BR>
eliminated.<BR>
    Perhaps the most complex system which nature and evolution have engineered<BR>
to accomplish this is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system.   This system<BR>
was discovered when early physicians found out that tissue from one human
could<BR>
not be grafted to another without rejection.   The physiological function
of<BR>
this system was not to foil the efforts of transplant surgeons, but to initiate<BR>
an immune response to parasites (viruses, bacteria).<BR>
    All cells of the body manufacture HLA proteins, whose function is to
bind<BR>
short peptides (protein fragments) and display them on the cell surface.
  Most <BR>
of the peptides are derived from the body's own proteins (self peptides),
<BR>
however when the body is infected by a virus or bacteria, the HLA molecules
pick <BR>
up peptides derived from broken down proteins of the virus or bacteria and
<BR>
present them to T lymphocytes.   <BR>
    The purpose of T-lymphocytes is to continually scan the surfaces of
other <BR>
cells to recognize foreign peptides while ignoring self peptides.   Once
a <BR>
T-cell receptor &quot;recognizes&quot; a foreign peptide, a complex series
of steps is set <BR>
into play which ultimately destroys the cell presenting the foreign peptide
as <BR>
well as living viruses or bacteria in the body which also have peptide sequences
<BR>
similar to those which were presented.     When the HLA system loses the
ability <BR>
to recognize self (self peptides) from non-self (foreign peptides),  <BR>
T-lymphocytes attack self-tissue resulting in what is known as an autoimmune
<BR>
disease (i.e. celiac disease, IDDM, MS, Dermatitis Herpetiformis, ankylosing
<BR>
spondylitis etc).<BR>
    The HLA proteins which present foreign peptides to circulating T-lymphocytes
<BR>
are coded by DNA sequences on chromosome 6.    The entire HLA system includes
<BR>
more than 100 genes and occupies a region more than four million base pairs
in <BR>
length which represent 1/3,000 of the total human genome.    On chromosome
6, <BR>
the HLA is sub-divided into Class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and Class II segments<BR>
(HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP).<BR>
    Individuals with autoimmune disease inherit  characteristic HLA combinations
<BR>
which identify their disease.   People with celiac disease have genetic
markers <BR>
(HLA-DR3, HLA -B8 and HLA-DQ2) which are associated with the disease;  
people <BR>
with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) almost always have DQ and
DR <BR>
genotypes.     Thus, the manner in which foreign proteins are presented
to <BR>
circulating T cells by HLA proteins tends to be different for individuals
with <BR>
auto-immune diseases compared to those without these maladies.<BR>
    As I mentioned in a previous post, the incidence of a variety of autoimmune
<BR>
diseases follows a southeasternly gradient from northern Europe (highest
<BR>
incidence) to the Mideast (lowest incidence) - can provide citations if
wanted.  <BR>
    This gradient occurs because the incidence of susceptible HLA haplotypes
<BR>
increases as one moves north westerly from the Mideast.    This gradient
which <BR>
occurs for both the incidence of autoimmune diseases and HLA haplotypes
is not a <BR>
serendipitous relationship but occurred as a result of the spread of agriculture
<BR>
from the Mideast to northern Europe (Simoons FJ.  Celiac disease as a geographic
<BR>
problem.  In: Food, Nutrition &amp; Evolution.  DN Walcher &amp; N Kretchmer
(Eds), NY <BR>
Masson Pub, 1981, 179-199).<BR>
    Consequently, as agriculture spread into Europe there were environmental
<BR>
elements associated with this demic expansion which progressively selected<BR>
against HLA haplotypes (combinations of HLA genes inherited from the two
<BR>
chromosomes in each cell) which were originally present in the pre-agrarian
<BR>
peoples of Europe.     Now, the question is, what were those environmental
<BR>
selective elements?   In the case of celiac disease, it doesn't take a rocket
<BR>
scientist to determine that it was wheat.<BR>
    Increasing consumption of wheat caused increased mortality from celiac
<BR>
disease - thus, the incidence of celiac disease and its susceptible HLA
<BR>
haplotypes (HLA-B8, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR) are lowest in those populations with
the <BR>
most chronologic exposure to wheat (Mideasterners and southern Europeans)
and <BR>
greatest in those populations with the least exposure (northern Europeans).
   <BR>
    Similar arguments can be made for IDDM and a host of other autoimmune
<BR>
diseases.   There are a substantial number of animal studies showing that
<BR>
consumption of wheat by rats increases the incidence of IDDM - citations
<BR>
available if wanted.<BR>
    How is it that wheat can wreak such havoc with the autoimmune system?
 Our <BR>
group believes that wheat contains peptide sequences which remain undigested
and <BR>
which can enter into systemic circulation.   These peptide sequences are
<BR>
homologous to a wide variety of the body's tissue peptide sequences and
hence <BR>
induce autoimmune disease via the process of molecular mimicry (e.g. macrophages<BR>
ingest the circulating wheat peptides and HLA molecules within the macrophage
<BR>
present amino acid sequences of the fragmented peptide to circulating <BR>
T-lymphocytes which through clonal expansion create other T cells to &quot;attack&quot;
<BR>
the offending dietary antigen and any other self antigen which has a similar
<BR>
peptide sequence - i.e. the bodies own tissues).    The original <BR>
non-agricultural HLA haplotypes conferred selective advantage because these
<BR>
genotypes provided enhanced immunity from certain types of infectious diseases,
<BR>
however with the advent of cereals in the diet they represented a liability.
    <BR>
    Thus, the genetic data clearly shows that a recently introduced food
type <BR>
has resulted in genetic discordance between our species and those from the
<BR>
gramineae family.<BR>
