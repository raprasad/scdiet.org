        <P>Can anybody shed some light on how an email sent to the list ends up 
          being posted on another site? I was informed by one of my friends that 
          while searching for me on the web he came across the scdiet.org site 
          and found an email I sent to the group. There is no &quot;mailto&quot; 
          that I can find, does anybody know this site and its webmaster?, because, 
          I for one I was not informed that my posts are public property and that 
          our site was a fishing ground for people to misuse our emails, perhaps 
          someone could shed some light on this? or perhaps Mr.&quot;dk/djembe&quot; 
          could explain his apparent lapse of courtesy? 
        <P>For now we will remain, passive observers!

<P>I have lurked mostly over the last three year and watched and read.  On a
regular basis the issue of &quot;noninvolvement&quot; of the medical community in the
SCD is discussed or its lack of understanding of our problems, and
inevitably there is a list of things that could be done by the present
group.  Mentioned often, are promotion to TV personalities, promotion to
Doctors and researchers to test the diet, etc..  Out of these ideas nothing
as yet has been discovered has provided an active forum for the promotion of
the SCD like Mik's web site.  He has provided a legacy of information that
anyone anywhere in the world, can review, that provides the only composite
of information on the SCD, gathered from people all around the world.  I
keep looking at it hoping that not only will it be used as a ever ready
knowledge repository for the sufferers of these intestinal woes, but perhaps
the medical community will sometime view this vast data base and become
convinced enough to do some work on this diet.  To date the information that
has been shared on these email forums is the best information in the
community, and Mik's willingness to foot the bill ($) and expend the the
vast amounts of time to put it on the web site is a testimony of his &quot;get it
done&quot; spirit.  If my emails are a part of helping someone else on the path
to healing, that in itself is encouraging.  But, if they could be also a
part of a permanent solution and understanding of these problems, that is a
wonderful gift.  Thanks Mik.<BR>

<P>Hi Partridge Family,<BR>
<P>&gt; http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/scd025.html<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; and found an email I sent to the group.  There is no &quot;mailto&quot; that I can<BR>
&gt; find, does anybody know this site and its webmaster?, because, I for one I<BR>
&gt; was not informed that my posts are public property and that our site was a<BR>
&gt; fishing ground for people to misuse our emails, perhaps someone could shed<BR>
&gt; some light on this? or perhaps Mr.&quot;dk/djembe&quot; could explain his apparent<BR>
&gt; lapse of courtesy?<BR>
<P>This is the SCD web site, run by Mik Aidt as a service to all of us on the
SCD, and to those who haven't learned about the SCD yet, and have happened
on the site through a link or web search.  It has info on the lists,
archives (to help new people on the list, especially, who haven't seen the
posts), recipes, info on the diet, health problems associated with
intestinal problems, sources to buy important SCD ingredients, etc.  Perhaps
you are a newbie and don't realize that anything you post to any email group
is most likely going to be on the list's site, will show up if someone does
a net search on your name, etc.  New list members are generally not informed
that their posts can be in archives because it's assumed that we all know
this.  This was not a &quot;lapse of courtesy&quot; by Mr. Aidt, who has done a lot of
work to help people find the diet and learn how to stay on it.<BR><BR>
If this concerns you, and there certainly is an immense problem of a total
lack of privacy on the net, you might want to read some of the info on
<A HREF="http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/index.shtml">
http://www.anonymizer.com/3.0/index.shtml</A> under Resources.  If you want your
posts to be anonymous, you can use Anonymizer's free anonymous mail feature,
you can go to Cyber Cafes and libraries and use different free email addys
every time you post to an email list or newsgroup, and you can take other
steps to insure that &quot;No one knows you are a dog&quot; when you surf or write
emails.  You can install Linux, if you haven't already, which is less
insecure than Windows, and do all your surfing and emailing with an
Anonymizer account, which is very reasonably priced (for a dial-up
connection) at $60 per quarter (or you can use your current ISP and surf
free through Anonymizer).<BR><BR>
Take care,<BR>

As I understand it, that's the SCD archives site.  That site led me to this
mailing list. A volunteer sorts our conversations by topic and keeps the
useful postings.  Have you visited the site yet?  There must be a way to
keep your postings out of the archives if you don't want them there.<BR><BR>
<I>Answer from webmaster: <BR>
There is a way! Just write below your letter that you don't want it placed on the web.<BR></I>
