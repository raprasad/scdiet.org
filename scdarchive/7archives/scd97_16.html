&gt; &gt;anyway, i don't understand how someone can get diarreha within
minutes of<BR>
&gt; &gt;eating<BR>
&gt; &gt;something....the intestinal tract is soooo long...how can it happen
so<BR>
&gt; &gt;fast??<BR>
&gt; </FONT></TT><BR>
<BR>
Hi Ann, <BR>
<BR>
this happened to me too - got to the stage of making sure the way to <BR>
the bathroom was clear before eating anything...<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, my understanding is that when you eat something, your body <BR>
sort of makes room for it in your stomach by moving everything else <BR>
on. ie eating triggers/increases peristalic action. And, if your <BR>
bowel isn't happy with life, everything just passes through.<BR>

Hi everyone! As far as I know when you feel the urge to go right after a<BR>
meal, the food did not agree with you and it is giving you the feeling as<BR>
if you will have a bowel movement. The rumbling and the movements that<BR>
occurs in your intestines acts as if you need to go and of course as we
all<BR>
know we don't need an invitation to go to the bathroom. I know it was more<BR>
elaborate when I read it from a book that I own, but I can't remember<BR>
exactly how they put it. I just remember that was the gist of it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck!<BR>

This is no mystery. As soon as you start chewing something in your mouth,<BR>
and swallowing, a wave of reflex nerve impulses goes down your whole<BR>
digestive tract. that is why most people void after a meal. However when<BR>
the bowel is inflamed, these implulses are magnified because in IBD there<BR>
is often a reversal of the motion of water out of the body into the bowels<BR>
rather than one of absoprtion. This is why the diarhea is loose. the normal<BR>
amount of peristalsis required to move a normal (dry movement) is far more<BR>
than what is required to move a loose one so the effect is more rapid<BR>
occuring a few minutes after eating. One can use this information to good<BR>
effect by taking 3-4 glasses of water on rising whther you have diarrhea
or<BR>
not you can get most of the fecal matter out early in the day to give you<BR>
more energy (less self intoxication) during the day<BR>

<B>UC symptoms - Zombie State</B><BR>
Wed, 7 May 1997 0:32:38 GMT<BR>
<BR>
To everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I have been reading material at the SCD website and have been <BR>
inspired to participate. I have never known others with my <BR>
condition (UC) in the 20 years I've had it! <BR>
<BR>
I will try to be brief. I have some questions about the diet. I <BR>
have been on it for 2 months. As soon as I started, my constant gas <BR>
went away. However, after 4-6 weeks my colon started bleeding, which <BR>
it hadn't done in a long time. I have eliminated cheese from my diet <BR>
now and that seems to help, but I am still battling my main symptoms: <BR>
intermittent dizzy spells, feverishness, and brainlessness, what I call
<BR>
&quot;the zombie state&quot;. I have dealt with this in various guises for
a <BR>
long time, even though my colon wasn't bleeding. Of course, it is at <BR>
its worst at those times when my intestinal problems &quot;heat up&quot;
<BR>
(bleeding, irregularity), and it generally corresponds to a <BR>
twitching/fluttering/discomfort sensation in my colon.<BR>
<BR>
What I want to know is, do others with UC have these symptoms, or do <BR>
their symptoms primarily involve diarhea etc.? My goal is to become <BR>
free of this zombie state and get on with my life, not just to cure <BR>
the most serious manifestations of my intestinal problems. I have <BR>
always assumed that they go hand in hand, but I would appreciate feedback
<BR>
from others about their experience with UC and the SCD <BR>
relative to this question. From what I have read of others' experience on
<BR>
the website, my symptoms are (currently) much milder than most <BR>
people's, or else just different.<BR>
<BR>
Another question: I read that slippery elm is approved by Elaine for <BR>
the diet, although I don't really understand how it could be. What about
<BR>
aloe vera gel, which contains mucopolysaccharides? I was pretty <BR>
desperate the other day and tried some, and it did provide temporary <BR>
relief. Is it officially banned?<BR>
<BR>
Brief history: Five years ago I gave up on regular medicine when <BR>
cortisone enemas weren't helping any longer, became a vegan and <BR>
improved my health somewhat with natural remedies such as colon <BR>
cleansing. I've been managing my worst zombie states by weekly <BR>
chiropractic/kinesiology treatments for two years and have been able <BR>
to resume a normal lifestyle. I had just decided that there was no cure
and that I <BR>
needed to mentally reconcile myself to having this disorder forever <BR>
when I remembered hearing about Elaine's book earlier (a previous <BR>
chiropractor thought it didn't apply to me since I wasn't having <BR>
diarhea). Now I am dedicated to trying the diet for at least a year, <BR>
but I don't want to get my hopes up, because everything else I have <BR>
tried at best only relieved symptoms (which of course is infinitely <BR>
better than being sick, but not the same as being healthy).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for any feedback,<BR>
<BR>

Dear John,<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to the group! I myself have never had an official diagnosis,<BR>
(exept for &quot;stress&quot;). My symptoms were mainly long term diarrhea
(6<BR>
years) and loose stool combined with a lot of fatigue. All has improved<BR>
for me on the SCD (two months for me as well) but I still battle the<BR>
zombie state you speak of. I hate it. I feel so healthy now in<BR>
general, but have days when I wake up feeling like I weigh a thousand<BR>
pounds and my head gets in a fog. Sometimes it is worse when I have<BR>
eaten a lot of roughage or get slightly constipated (I've never had<BR>
bleeding). These days the perspective I have on it is that the zombie<BR>
state is somehow related to leaky gut -- which can happen worse during<BR>
acute stages of bowel disease and also seems to somtimes get worse<BR>
during healing because as the gut heals, toxins stay in the intestines<BR>
longer because things don't move through as fast.<BR>
<BR>
What helps me is doing gentle yoga stretches (especially the bow<BR>
pose), taking epsom salt baths (which help draw accumulated toxins out<BR>
of the body), and recently, massaging my forearms and thighs (broad<BR>
strokes away from the heart) as Michael of this group has suggested. <BR>
Actually, that last thing has seemed to make a huge difference<BR>
sometimes. I've also just started taking psyllium regularly, which is<BR>
supposed to help cut down on toxicity as well. This is the only<BR>
understanding I have of the zombie state that has made sense to me, the<BR>
toxicity thing. But I am open to and welcome hearing other<BR>
perspectives, since I haven't licked it yet. I have a friend with IBS<BR>
who also gets like this, and both she and I still have these bad days,<BR>
even though we seem to be doing so great in general.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

Dear John &amp; Denise,<BR>
I'm not a doctor (don't even play one on TV), but my own analysis of the<BR>
&quot;Zombie state&quot; is this; Our bodies have an inherent weakness,
either UC,<BR>
Crohns, Arthritis, blah blah blah. We share a host of auto immune diseases.<BR>
I find myself in that state even when I've had a bit too much to eat<BR>
(hence, suggestions of small frequent feedings). I think our bodies have
to<BR>
work much harder than the norm &amp; therefore when they are busy fighting
to<BR>
sustain digestion or are fighting a relapse of the disease, or even when
we<BR>
are coming down with a cold, our bodies have to work much harder at keeping<BR>
us healthy. What I think the &quot;Zombie state&quot; is, is battle fatigue
pure &amp;<BR>
simple. I've come to this conclusion purely by intuition and by listening<BR>
to my body. Although I consider myself to be currently healthy because my<BR>
colon is in excellent shape, I still have these arthritic symptoms I deal<BR>
with on a daily basis. One of the reasons I've stayed at my job, is that
I<BR>
NEED a place to get up and go to each day. Sometimes I'm so fatigued that<BR>
simply staying in bed with the cover pulled up over my head seems the way<BR>
to go, but I beleive that for me it would be the beginning of the end. I'd<BR>
be curious at the groups feedback.<BR>
Always trying to live in the positive,<BR>
Rachel<BR>

&gt;"the zombie state". <BR><BR></TT></FONT>

To John G,<BR>
I have felt like that too, but mainly I feel it was due to anemia (low
hemoglobin), and deficiencies caused by malabsorption.  I don't know if that is
the same as a "leaky gut", but I felt less spacey and could remember things
better and concentrate more easily when my hemoglobin went up.  The diet helps
heal the gut which in turn allows for better absorption of nutrients, vitamins,
and minerals.  So the diet should help with this "zombie state".  I also think
taking a special multi-mineral supplement that is easily absorbed may have
helped me.<P>

&gt;Another question:  I read that slippery elm is approved by Elaine for <BR>
&gt;the diet, although I don't really understand how it could be.  What about <BR>
&gt;aloe vera gel, which contains mucopolysaccharides?  I was pretty <BR>

&gt;relief.  Is it officially banned?<P>

Elaine doesn't like to say yay or nay to many herbal supplements and what not. 
If it's not in the book, usually it means that Elaine has not tested or
researched that item and we have to decide or test it out on ourselves.  As for
aloe vera, to me, it seems like a vegetable, and I would think it's ok, as long
as it's pure.  Regarding the ulmus althea (slippery elm), I don't know if
Elaine ever "officially approved" it, but I suppose if people on the diet are
using it without problems, it may be ok.  I know it is supposed to be very
soothing to inflamed tissue, so logically it should be good for us, but I don't
know what the carbohydrate content is.  Correct me if I'm wrong - anyone.
<P>
Good luck,<BR>
Anna

Hi Rachel and everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Yes - I know the &quot;zombi&quot; syndrom.<BR>
<BR>
I've had UC for almost 7 years, though I was only diagnosed about a year<BR>
ago.<BR>
<BR>
My regular doctor kept telling me my symptoms where caused by stress and<BR>
obessity.<BR>
<BR>
I wasn't diagnosed before I ended up in hospital, where the specialist<BR>
gave me a reprimand for not getting the proper treatement before !<BR>
<BR>
Hmm.. where was I ? Oh yes zombi - I'm in the zombi state now. Extremely<BR>
tired, like exhausted. Totally incapable of concentrating and an urge to<BR>
just sleep. The zombi is always triggered by a flare.<BR>
<BR>
I went to a party yesterday and I cheated. I had the &quot;Honey glazed&quot;<BR>
turkey that probably hadn't seen any real honey, spaghetti, cheese sauce<BR>
(it had flour) and an Irish coffee later in the evening.<BR>
<BR>
Today I've been really sick with diarrhoea, pains and the zombi.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't really have that much spaghetti or sauce or meat - there were<BR>
plenty of fresh delicious vegies.. I really didn't even want the<BR>
stuff..It was just a new couple and I REALLY DIDN'T want to explain<BR>
about my *condition*. Sigh..I really would like to be *normal* again.<BR>
<BR>
I'm sorry - the zombi is always accompanied by black depression. I'll<BR>
try to be a little more  positive. You - know I've been batteling<BR>
obessity for years, eating tons of complex carbohydrates like potatoes,<BR>
spaghetti and bread. I've actually LOST weight on the SCD !<BR>
<BR>
I think it'll be a while before I cheat again! I wonder how long it will<BR>
take for my flare to subside. Should I start over I wonder ?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for listening, I think I'll go lie down now. :-)<BR>

<BR>
Hi,<BR>
<BR>
I definitely have a problem with depression that accompanies &quot;the <BR>
&quot;zombie&quot;.  I recently read about the herb St. Johnswort in Newsweek
<BR>
being used for depression, and wonder if such treatments can also <BR>
work for people with UC (i.e. if depression, etc. is linked to <BR>
intestinal problems, can some treatment not linked to such problems <BR>
really work).<BR>
<BR>
Re flax oil:  Is anyone using this specifically to address <BR>
inflammation?  How much?  What about DHA capsules, which I recently <BR>
heard are more readily absorbed?  I once experimented with about 1 <BR>
1/2 Tablespoons a day (flax oil), but wasn't really tracking anti-inflammatory
<BR>
effects at the time.<BR>

Hi John,<BR>
<BR>
I am continuing to play with dosage.  Right now I am taking the<BR>
equivelant of 1T. of flaxseed oil in gelcap form, plus about a tsp. of<BR>
fish oil.  So far, I have noticed an anti-inflammatory effect in the<BR>
form of a chronic excema condition improving, also my skin in general. 
<BR>
<BR>
Can't tell about the bowel stuff, although that has been improving too<BR>
-- it's just that I'm taking psyllium right now and I think that is also<BR>
helping so I can't tell which helps more.  By the way, I think the<BR>
latter really helps with inflammation, helps lubricate those ravaged<BR>
intestines!  In general, I find that each thing I do that helps, adds to<BR>
the pie of healing, but that no one thing is a miracle cure -- the scd<BR>
comes close.  :)  <BR>
<BR>
I have had experience with Hypericum.  The dosage that is used for<BR>
depression is 300mg of a standardized supplement, 3 times a day.  It<BR>
needs to be taken regularly and consistently -- after four weeks or so<BR>
the results will show up.  It has to build up in your blood.  Hypericum<BR>
helped me through a difficult time last fall when I was so discouraged<BR>
about my health, I was scrapin' bottom.  There is quite a bit of<BR>
documentation about Hypericum helping as an anti-depressant, many books<BR>
out there.  It is thought to act as a mild MAO which will increase your<BR>
serotonin levels.  I went off of it about a month ago when I was<BR>
eliminating supplements because I was afraid of the starch mine possibly<BR>
contained.  Although I still get the zombie state (sounds like a bad 'B'<BR>
movie), my depression didn't return.  So there's my two cents!<BR>

Thu,  8 May 1997 19:03:43 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Matthew,<BR>
I have to admit that I've been tempting to give myself permission to cheat
on<BR>
the diet at times.  I seem to be different than a lot of people on this
list<BR>
because I don't suffer symptoms every time that I cheat.  Actually, I seem
to<BR>
be able to cheat for a couple of weeks before symptoms show up.  Although<BR>
who's to say what's really going on at the intestinal level and with my<BR>
immune system.  So if I were to ever cheat I think I would do it for a few<BR>
days here and there, instead of going crazy for a few months straight.<BR>
I have also been tempted to introduce certain foods that aren't permitted
and<BR>
find out if maybe my system is actually okay with them.  As this may explain<BR>
why I seem to be able to cheat with no adverse affects.  I know there is<BR>
someone in this group who eats rice and doesn't seem to have any problems.<BR>
But then I also think that each little cheat may set back my progress on
the<BR>
diet in the long run and I think that maybe I should just follow Elaine's<BR>
recommendations and stick with the diet strictly until all symptoms have
been<BR>
gone for over a year.<BR>
It is probably something that all of us on this diet struggle with.  And
I<BR>
don't think there is any easy answer.  If there is one thing that I have<BR>
learned being in this group it's that we are all individuals and can't expect<BR>
the same things to work for all of us or assume that we will all end up<BR>
making the same choices.<BR>

<B>zombie state</B><BR>
Thu,  8 May 1997 22:48:51 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I sympathize with those who suffer from that terrible tiredness that goes<BR>
along with IBDs.  I think the very nature of these diseases causes more<BR>
toxins to be circulating in the blood which in turn causes the tiredness.<BR>
This is something I fight against continually.  Also my naturopath tells
me<BR>
that my liver is not functioning efficiently at clearing the toxins and
so<BR>
I get to that &quot;zombie&quot; state.  Small things that help are to do
stretching<BR>
type excercises such as yoga as this stimulates the circulatory system and<BR>
helps the liver do its work.  Also drinking lots of water helps to remove<BR>
the toxins. <BR>
<BR>
To John C<BR>
Thanks for all your work on our behalf to get a new list server up and<BR>
running.  I hope that you are recovering to better health after your set<BR>
backs.<BR>
<BR>
To Mathew<BR>
Yes, I know that frustration of the diet not quite being a cure.  It has<BR>
helped me wonderfully but I still get diarrhea about once a week as well
as<BR>
rumbles and bloating imbetween times.  My naturopath says that I have<BR>
protozoan parasites and that they are the cause of the problems.  They have<BR>
an interesting life cycle where they burrow into the cells causing little<BR>
discomfort, then they break out into the lumen of the intestines to cause<BR>
problems again.  He is treating me for this and I have been improving very<BR>
slowly.  I suppose I can always hope that I'll be cured one day.<BR>
I wouldn't consider coming off the diet though, as it has helped me so much.<BR>
<BR>
Good health<BR>

<BR>
Hi y'all. This is my first time writing to the group. I just wanted to <BR>
say, for all you Zombie people out there (wierd expression, by the <BR>
way!), I am currently taking Floravital which is an iron liquid formula
<BR>
and is doing a perfect job of giving me energy as well as nutrition.<BR>
<BR>
I was in the depths of despair trying to find some sort of iron I could
<BR>
tolerate and both my doctor and herbalist said iron would give me <BR>
energy.<BR>
<BR>
But the doc said, &quot;If we don't find you anything, you'll have to get
a <BR>
regular injection in your bottom which might stain.. &quot; Yeuch.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, though, the herbalist suggested we take Floravital which is
<BR>
the yeast free alternative (suitable, huh?) to Floradix -(the main <BR>
name). If any of you guys are curious about this, the address is,<BR>

Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I am curious about this idea of iron supplementation.  Following a <BR>
recent posting on anemia, I browsed through Andrew Weil's book on <BR>
natural healing.  He claims that the only people who should take iron <BR>
are those losing a lot of blood.  He says that the body cannot <BR>
otherwise rid itself of iron, and buildups can be toxic.<BR>
<BR>
I wonder if there is &quot;invisible bleeding&quot; involved in ulcerative
<BR>
colitis; if at times of low inflammation the colon is still bleeding <BR>
but the blood is not obvious or visible.  This might account for <BR>
ongoing anemia and the visible benefits of iron supplementation.<BR>

</TT>&gt; Hi group,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I'm not asking anyone to play doctor, but has anyone out there<BR>
&gt; experienced more bloating or passing more mucus when you seem to be<BR>
&gt; healing? I've been on the diet for two and a half months.<BR>
&gt; Lately I've been getting extremely bloated (like there's a heavy stone<BR>
&gt; in my stomache and intestines), out of the blue, unrelated to foods
I<BR>
&gt; eat. It is not just a little bloating, it's really bad. Sometimes<BR>
&gt; while I have it, I get pretty light headed, which is a problem at work.<BR>
&gt; Then it passes and my energy is as strong as ever -- then I get really<BR>
&gt; puzzled.<BR>
&gt; It's been happening since I started taking psyllium, which really<BR>
&gt; improved my bowel movements, from constipation to regular, but every<BR>
&gt; once in a while I pass what look like mucus in my otherwise regular<BR>
&gt; stool. I don't know if this is good or bad, or what it means. I<BR>
&gt; stopped taking the psyllium 2 days ago to see if it would just stop<BR>
&gt; happening, thought maybe I was taking too much or something,. But last<BR>
&gt; night I woke up in the middle of the night so bloated that I just had
to<BR>
&gt; lay there for several hours. I haven't gotten this much gas out of
the<BR>
&gt; blue for five years. I am hoping it is the healing response going on
--<BR>
&gt; or else maybe I have some virus or something. Once again, I want to<BR>
&gt; emphasize that I'm not asking anyone to play doctor, but if you've
had a<BR>
&gt; simillar problem or perspective, on bloating or passing more mucus
when<BR>
&gt; you seem to be healing, please let me know.<BR>

Hi Denise,<BR>
<BR>
I have made the same experience over the years: The more active the<BR>
inflammation of the bowel was (mucus and blood) the less bloating I had,<BR>
and when I got better (less mucus and blood and firm stool) I got more<BR>
bloating. I don`t know why.<BR>

Dear Denise: <BR>
<BR>
I know exactly what you mean. I will be on the diet 3 months this week.<BR>
I thought the problem was trying to add in vegetables to my otherwise meat,
eggs<BR>
and cheese diet. But maybe it is the healing process. <BR>
<BR>
Or maybe it is the 2-3 month plateau Elaine mentions in her book. <BR>
<BR>
I'm trying not to be discouraged, but I was feeling really good about the<BR>
bloating going down. I really like it that people stopped asking me when
the<BR>
baby is due. <BR>
<BR>
Let's give it a little more time. As for me, I'm going back to the<BR>
beginning with few add-ins. <BR>
<BR>
Best wishes. <BR>

This is a very un-scientific thought, but it seems to me that I get <BR>
discomfort or even exacerbated symptoms when I eat a sweeter diet, or a
<BR>
larger amount of honey, etc... I think moderation is the key. I am <BR>
resigning myself to the fact that there is enough sweetness in, let's <BR>
say for instance an acorn squash, that there's no need to add anything <BR>
to it to make it more palatable. I think &quot;sweetness&quot; in itself
can be <BR>
an enemy, that perhaps, simple or not, there's too much there, it's <BR>
dense or something, too much to handle. Sounds crazy, huh? well, it's <BR>

Hi Matt,<BR>
<BR>
Many of us with intestinal problems, due to the long term imballances in<BR>
our flora -- also have overgrowths of yeast that tend to feed on sugars<BR>
like honey. I myself have to limit the sweet stuff as well. But<BR>
gradually I have been able to eat more of it -- more fruit. I look<BR>
forward to the day I can eat honey! Just to let you know, it's not<BR>
completely unscientific, what you are thinking.<BR>

&gt;&gt; I think &quot;sweetness&quot; in itself can be <BR>
an enemy, that perhaps, simple or not, there's too much there.&lt;&lt;<BR>
<BR>
I have stopped trying to make everything sweet in my diet, and have found<BR>
it's not that hard. I eat all fruit unsweetened. I remember as I child my<BR>
mother slicing fresh strawberries and then stirring in lots of sugar. I
eat<BR>
my fruit plain now and once your taste buds adjust, you will find it plenty<BR>
sweet just like that. I eat the yogurt with no honey added and it tastes<BR>
just fine, has a tang all its own, my squash with no honey etc. I use no<BR>
artificial sweeteners, if I want a soft drink I drink club soda &quot;straight<BR>
up&quot;. I have also cut out all added salt, my butter is unsalted and
I have<BR>
found a source of unsalted cheese, I add no salt to my cooking. I am sure<BR>
that I still get lots of salt as it is in canned tomatoes, canned tuna,<BR>
sundried tomatoes, pickles, and absolutely every other supermarket product<BR>
there is. Can't say that any of this has particularly helped me, but it
is<BR>
nice to stop struggling to find a way to sweeten things, and it is an<BR>
adventure in gastronomy to learn to enjoy food as it is.<BR>
<BR>
To the person who suggested &quot;Tahini Gravy&quot; thanks so much for
a great new<BR>
taste and a highly nutritious idea. I use it on all my vegetables now, and<BR>
I skip the butter.<BR>
<BR>
I enjoyed the article on the Omega fats and am now experimenting with<BR>
rebalancing the fats in my life.<BR>
<BR>
One thing I can say about all of this, at long last that annoying white<BR>
coating is disappearing from my tongue. Would like to give up fruit and<BR>
cheese to see if I can kick the last of the Candida out, but so far can't<BR>
resist them. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks to all, and good health -<BR>

I was at a salad bar recently and read labels on the little salt packets.<BR>
I noticed that what I thought was pure sodium choloride contained a few<BR>
chemicals (presumably to help granulation) and DEXTROSE. So now the salt<BR>

&gt; Hi,<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I discovered the scd web site while trying to find information on<BR>
&gt; carbohydrates. I have been having considerable digestive problems<BR>
&gt; for around 4 months now and had become suspicious of starchy foods<BR>
&gt; (potatoes especially seemed to cause me to crash). The web site<BR>
&gt; was a godsend. I immediately rushed out and found Elaine's book<BR>
&gt; and have read it through in the last day. I've been on the diet<BR>
&gt; for the last few days now and immediately notice improvement -<BR>
&gt; no more cramps and gas.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have a few questions...<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 1. I've read a few posts about getting almond flour from California.<BR>
&gt; Does anyone know of a similar Canadian source (preferably Eastern<BR>
&gt; Canada)?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 2. Is there some gadget one can buy to make one's own nut flour?<BR>
&gt; Some time ago we tried using a coffee grinder to do this but<BR>
&gt; the motor burned out after a short while. I suspect almonds are<BR>
&gt; tougher than coffee beans.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 3. I saw a recipe in the book for homemade mayonnaise. However<BR>
&gt; it uses a raw egg. What do people do to avoid salmonella?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; 4. Does anyone know a web site or some other source of info on<BR>
&gt; what particular sugars are in each food? There are numerous<BR>
&gt; nutrition web sites which give nutrient breakdowns but they<BR>
&gt; never seem to go further than saying how much carbohydrate is<BR>
&gt; in a particular food. Similarly I understand from Elaine's book<BR>
&gt; there are different kinds of starches. Is there any source<BR>
&gt; of information on which type is in each starchy food?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; THANKS!<BR>
&gt; <BR>
<BR>
Hi Guy,<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to the group. I will take a stab at answering a few of your<BR>
questions. About the raw egg in Mayo -- in my experience, this is the<BR>
tried and true way people have been making mayo for decades, if not<BR>
centuries. The vinegar (you can even add an extra tablespoon, I do)<BR>
probably helps with any bad bacteria. Mayo stays fresh in the fridge<BR>
quite well, I don't think, personally, you need to worry about that raw<BR>
egg. Maybe others have a different opinon.<BR>
<BR>
In regards to grinding nuts, I use my blender. It's not a high tech<BR>
blender either, just your regular garden variety blender. The nuts I<BR>
have used have not been that hard. I find coffee beans much harder than<BR>
almonds. <BR>
<BR>
Glad to hear you are feeling better on the diet. I've been on it almost<BR>
three months and I too feel a lot better.<BR>

Hi List,<BR>
<BR>
I've just joined. Some of you may know me from the newsgroups. I have<BR>
celiac disease and follow a very strict gluten-free diet, and have also<BR>
been dairy-free for a year now. Since I believe in the importance of GF<BR>
strictness, I'd be happy to help and answer questions in this area.<BR>
<BR>
I am now also a listowner of several mailing lists, all of which are<BR>
somewhat applicable to the people here. They are:<BR>
<BR>
NO-MILK. While Elaine does allow certain types of dairy, like grains this<BR>
is a new food to the human diet. Because we have not fully adapted to milk,<BR>
it is often the source of allergies, intolerances, and medical problems.<BR>
This list is mostly parents of children that have to avoid dairy because
of<BR>
allergies or autism.<BR>
<BR>
The PALEODIET mailing list is a RESEARCH oriented list. It is<BR>
semi-moderated and has as subscribers all of the leading researchers in
the<BR>
field. The most interesting archives to read.<BR>
<BR>
The PALEOFOOD mailing list is an unmoderated SUPPORT list for people trying<BR>
to follow a Paleolithic diet in today's age. It is not yet a week old. A<BR>
Paleolithic diet excludes grains, dairy, and beans.<BR>
<BR>

I gather the majordomo system this list runs on does not have archives and<BR>
Mik Aidt is filling in? (This is my first majordomo list.) In the welcome<BR>

Welcome Jennifer a fellow IBS sufferer.  You are so fortunate to have a
Dr<BR>
who recommends the SCD,  I wish there were a few more MD's who did this<BR>
instead of putting the condition down to stress alone.  But I can empathize<BR>
with your concerns about weight loss.  Many of us in this group experienced<BR>
this at the beginning especially before nut products are introduced.  My<BR>
solution to this was to snack regularly as well as to eat some starchy<BR>
vegetables at my main meal.  My snacks were made up of ripe bananas and<BR>
cheese.  Easy to have any time of the day.  My weight stabalized around
the<BR>
3rd month when I could fully include nuts and yogurt into my diet.  Don't<BR>
be concerned about the plant fats in nuts, olives and advocados etc.  These<BR>
kind of fats are healthy and help to ofset the increased animal fat intake<BR>
of this high protein diet.   Personally I believe these plant fats are the<BR>
reason that this diet doesn't produce high cholesterol levels that might
be<BR>
expected from the eggs, cheese and meat.<BR>
<BR>
Welcome also to Neil.  To answer some of your questions.  Yes ham is<BR>
allowed IF it is prepared with no starch or sugar.  You have to ask<BR>
questions and read labels.  It's the same with bacon.  I live in Ontario<BR>
and I've found a supermarket brand of both ham and bacon with no sugar that<BR>
I seem to tolerate.<BR>
Olives and saurekraut prepared in lactic acid are wonderful as this is an<BR>
alternative source of  acidophilus bacteria which is found in the yogurt<BR>
that we make.<BR>
As far as Dry curd cottage cheese, I've never been able to find it but the<BR>
farmers cheese, again available in the supermarket in Ontario, is a<BR>
substitute when making bread.<BR>
<BR>
John,  You asked about alcohol.  Personally I find the occasional drink<BR>
does not irritate my symptoms but it makes me incredibly tired.<BR>
<BR>
Carol W.   I'm convinced that bad sleep patterns can go with IBDs.  I have<BR>
read that the toxins produced by the bacteria can cause nervous upset such<BR>
as anxiety and poor sleep patterns.  I think Elaine attributes nightmares<BR>
and behavioural problems in children to the proliferation of the<BR>
undesirable bacteria.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps,  As ever I enjoy reading the supportive posts put out by<BR>
this group.<BR>
<BR>
Good health<BR>

<BR>
Dear Ms Suen,<BR>
<BR>
Please take a moment if you will to read the attached file concerning<BR>
probiotic technology licensed by the USDA.<BR>
<BR>
Diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome one year ago Iam now convinced<BR>
that most all of my symptoms were a result of an overgrowth of<BR>
Citrobacter<BR>
freundii identified by your lab in December 1996.<BR>
Chronic sinus infections treated with six antibiotics proved ineffective<BR>
and only sterilized my intestinal tract of frendly bacteria.(Bactrim,<BR>
Lorabid,Zithromax twice,Biaxin,Augmentin) By the time I took the correct<BR>
antibiotic Cipro, as suggested by your sensitivity chart, the bacteria<BR>
was<BR>
so entrenched that a ten day dose could not eradicate this pathogen.<BR>
<BR>
I speak from experience when I say that this bacteria can be devistating<BR>
to ones health. It feeds on sugar and is capable of leaving the<BR>
intestinal<BR>
tract taking up residence in the mucus membranes of the sinus and lungs.<BR>
A severe respiratory infection could not be treated with yet another<BR>
antibiotic in February of this year. Fortunately intravenous hydrogen<BR>
peroxide arrested its progress.<BR>
<BR>
Eliminating sugar from the diet similar to the anti-candida diet and<BR>
taking<BR>
citrus seed extract has proven to be most effective in controlling the<BR>
growth of this bacteria. Any cheating whatsoever on the sugar intake<BR>
proves disastrous. A recent follow-up CSA shows a reduction of the<BR>
pathogen<BR>
from previous levels. Adding close to 100 billion Acidophilus and<BR>
Bifidus<BR>
bacteria per day for the past two months has increased the levels of<BR>
healthy bacteria shown on the CSA results.<BR>
<BR>
Conventional medicine has overlooked this bacteria for years as I have<BR>
been<BR>
plagued with IBS and diarrhea. I now have one bowel movement a day and<BR>
no longer bedridden with devestating fatigue. Iam concerned however with<BR>
where else this bacteria has traveled,(pancreas,gall<BR>
bladder,liver,etc.).<BR>
I cannot stop the citrus seed extract or within three to five days<BR>
symptoms<BR>
begin to return. Considering another antibiotic at this point may end up<BR>
reversing the progress seen thus far.<BR>
<BR>
The point Im trying to relay here is the seriousness of this pathogen<BR>
and<BR>
what it is capable of. Which takes me back to the attached file<BR>
concerning<BR>
the use of Citrobacter freundii in a probiotic bacterial culture<BR>
administered<BR>
to young chicks to competitively inhibit Salmonella bacteria in their<BR>
intestinal tracts.<BR>
<BR>
Why would the USDA approve one pathogen to replace another? Salmonella<BR>
Enteritidis is able to infect the ovaries of hens and invade the egg as<BR>
it<BR>
forms. Could Citrobacter freundii have that capability? Certainly fecal<BR>
material can contaminate the outside of a chicken carcass or egg. This<BR>
technology has been licensed to Continental Grain Co.(Duluth, MN.)and<BR>
Milk<BR>
Specialties Co.(Dundee,IL). Milk Specialties Co. has a product called<BR>
CF3.<BR>
I have requested data sheets. It is not known what Continental Grain Co.<BR>
has done with this technology.<BR>
<BR>
This bacteria is seen quite frequently as reported by Dr. Jorgensen`s<BR>
office. I read on your WEB page that Barry Smith author of &quot;The Poop
is<BR>
in<BR>
the mail&quot; also tested positive for this pathogen. Although the article<BR>
was<BR>
quite comical it has been no laughing matter for me I assure you. Could<BR>
chicken and eggs be a major source of this bacteria? The Department of<BR>
health<BR>
may not recognize the seriousness of this pathogen or even be testing<BR>
for it.<BR>
I think this requires further investigation.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to hear from you regarding this issue. Please feel free to<BR>
Email me or call directly at (617)275-0850x249 I have supporting<BR>
documentation<BR>
for all subject matter mentioned in this letter.<BR>

The USDA announced in June 1995 the licensing of competitive probiotic<BR>
technology for prevention of<BR>
Salmonella contamination in chickens to Continental Grain Co. This<BR>
apparently involves licensing of 5,340,577<BR>
and/or 5,308,615. The database record for 5,308,615 follows:<BR>
<BR>
     <B>Probiotic for Control of Salmonella</B><BR>
<BR>
     Pat. No.: 5,308,615; Date: May 3, 1994; Lab: College Station, TX<BR>
     Inv.: Nisbet, D.J.; DeLoach, J.R.; Corrier, D.E.<BR>
            Probiotic bacterial cultures administered to young chick are<BR>
useful treatments to competitively inhibit<BR>
     pathogenic Salmonella bacteria in the intestinal tract of chickens<BR>
and other poultry. The probiotic includes populations<BR>
     or cultures of substantially biologically pure bacteria, including<BR>
at least one Lactobacillus species; one or both of<BR>
     Lactococcus lactis, and Citrobacter freundii; and at least one of:<BR>
one or more Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium,<BR>
     Propionibacterium and Escherichia species. The probiotic is<BR>
administered to the fowl in an amount effective for<BR>
     inhibiting Salmonella colonization.<BR>
<BR>
            The invention also provides a method for isolating<BR>
probiotics which are effective for controlling or inhibiting<BR>
     Salmonella colonization of fowl, from fecal droppings or cecal<BR>
contents of adult fowl. The droppings or cecal contents<BR>
     are combined with a culture medium and incubated without dilution<BR>
(i.e. batch culture) under anaerobic conditions; the<BR>
resultant culture is subjected to continuous flow conditions until a<BR>
steady state is achieved; and the steady state culture<BR>
     may be recovered for use as a probiotic.<BR>
<BR>
            Status - The USDA announced the licensing of competitive<BR>
probiotic technology in June 1995 to Continental<BR>
     Grain Co., presumably on a nonexclusive basis. This licensing<BR>
apparently involves this patent and/or another patent<BR>
     (5,308,615) by several of the same inventors. The licensed method<BR>
involving spray or drinkng water administration of<BR>
     enteric bacteria derived from adult chickens to young chicks has<BR>
been shown to reduce Salmonella contamination of<BR>
     carcasses from 90% to 10%.<BR>
