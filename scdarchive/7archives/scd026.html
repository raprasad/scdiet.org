Matt,<BR>
My brother sent me an article (I'm not sure of the magazine) about a study
that<BR>
was written up in Annals of Internal Medicine.  It discusses nicotine &quot;soothed<BR>
symptoms of ulcerative colitis&quot;.  In the study the patients wore a
nicotine<BR>
patch.  <BR>
The article states:<BR>
&quot;The patch releases enough nicotine into the bloodstream to curb colitis
woes,<BR>
like severe diarrhea, by increasing the digestive mucus that lines and protects<BR>
the colon&quot; <BR>
&quot;Study author William Sandborn, associate professor at the Mayo Clinic,
say he<BR>
believes patients will likely need a maintenance dose of he patch for one
to two<BR>
years&quot;.<BR>
It doesn't state what happens after two years on the patch.  Are you cured?
In<BR>
remission?  Can you get addicted to the patch?  <BR>
I am not recommending it, but I have been in your situation and wanted to
pass<BR>
this on.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

Just wanted to mention a few things about smoking and IBD.<BR>
First of all, it seems to be beneficial to people with UC and detrimental
to<BR>
people with Crohn's disease.<BR>
It seems to be the nicotine that is responisble for it's effects. And many<BR>
studies have been done with the nicotine patch.  I don't think any doctor<BR>
would ever want to recommend smoking as a treatment to other diseases.<BR>
Also, I have heard that they are developing an enema that contains nicotine<BR>
as an alternative to the patch as it would have even fewer side effects.<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>

<BR>
Matt, Roger and others,<BR>
<BR>
In October 1996, Dr. Cecilla Benoni from Sweden published the results of
a 
scientific research in Sweden stating that &quot;the more smoke, the greater
risk 
for Crohns&quot; - smoking increases the risk of relapse and flare for Crohns, 
whereas it can have a positive effect for Colitis. <BR>
She emphasizes, though, that even if you have Colitis, smoking is NOT healthy. 
(It is better to use nicotine plasters.)<BR>
Generally, smokers get to the point where they need an operation earlier
than 
nonsmokers.<BR>

Subject: <B>Smoking, again</B>
<BR><BR>
Hi, folks<BR><BR>

I apologise in advance for asking questions that have probably been
asked a thousand times before, but....<BR><BR>

I've just stopped smoking for the 3rd time in 7 years (on the previous
two occasions I started again a couple of years later).<BR><BR>

I am now  convinced of the link between smoking and the bowel problems
and other symptoms I have got (joint pains, sore eyes, tendon
problems, etc), because after 3 weeks without cigarettes, the
symptoms, which almost disappeared while I was smoking, are back.
This has happened each time I have given up in the past.<BR><BR>

I was re-reading the Gottschall diet book, and in chapter 2 there is a
quote from a bloke by the name of Dr. Heaton, who says<BR><BR>
<UL>
	&quot;The connection between Crohns disease and a sugar-rich diet =09
	 is proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Apart from smoking, this
	 is the strongest clue to an environmental etiology of the=20
	disease.&quot;<BR><BR>
</UL>
Is there any reason to suppose that gut problems set off by smoking
are any less treatable with the diet than ones which were set off by
eating too much sugar?<BR><BR>

Has anybody else had the same sort of problems after stopping smoking?
<BR><BR>
Have you managed to solve them?<BR><BR>

Why should  cigarettes cause problems with the gut bacteria balance?<BR><BR>

Thanks in advance for any replies.<BR><BR>

Dear Pete,<BR>
Lots of people on this list dont smoke &amp; have never smoked and have this
disease. Some of them get touchy to read about smoking being in any way
advocated here and I don't blame them. The facts about nicotine are in. Its
dangerous!<BR>
Having said that, my experiences have been exactly like yours. After being
in total remission on the diet for over two &amp; 1/2 years, I quit smoking,
and within 3 weeks began bleeding. I went back to smoking and stopped
bleeding. Pretty awful right? I've done a lot of online research into the
matter &amp; have spoken to Elaine at length on the subject. I sent her a load
of data I'd downloaded on nicotine and she did find one interesting link.<BR>
One of the articles I sent her described the affects of nicotine in sending
messages to the brain. It slows down certain impulses. Well, it seems that
when her daughter was put on the diet, Dr. Haas had her take a small amount
of something called atropine sulfate. At the time this was available over
the counter which it no longer is. It seems that today it is only used in
certain surgical procedures (mostly dental) to slow down the bleeding.
Elaine said that the information I sent her on nicotine was identical to
the description on the affects of this drug. She said she's tried over the
years to find out more about the drug and how to obtain it, but with no
success. I dont know how we can go about finding out more, I'm certainly no
scientist, but it would seem worth investigating.<BR>
The other thing I want to tell you is that when I stopped smoking, I went
on the patch. It wasn't till I stopped the patch that the bleeding started.
When I tried to go back on the patch, it seemed as though it was too late,
the bleeding wouldn't stop. When and if I ever get the courage to try
again, I will reamin on a small dosage nicotine patch over the long haul. I
know someone that has done this and it has worked for them.<BR>
I was going to write this letter to you privately, but decided to send it
to the group in case someone has any ideas about how to track down more
info on this atropine sulfate. Lots of luck.<BR>

Dear Paula,<BR>
I was bleeding when I began the diet. I stopped almost immediately. I was<BR>
still on azulphadine &amp; remained so for about another year &amp; 3 months. In<BR>
the beginning I had short (one day) relapses occasionally, but they stopped<BR>
altogether after a few months, and I had no blood for about 2 and a  half<BR>
years until I stopped smoking last Nov. at which time I began bleeding<BR>
profusely and didn't stop til I went back to smoking (4-6 weeks?). So I am<BR>
currently a non-med taking, smoking, SCD, bowel healthy, arthritic. BTW I<BR>
am planning to stop smoking again soon, but this time, I will not go off<BR>
the patch for a long time, maybe never.<BR>

Subject: <B>Nicotine and colitis</B><BR>
<BR>
After 2 years on the diet, I decided to reintroduce certain foods -<BR>
rice, corn (in the form of tortilla chips) and, well, beer.   I also had<BR>
been smoking at the time.  Well, I held up pretty well, and perhaps<BR>
overdid it, and my symptoms started returning, to the point where I was<BR>
100% fanatically adhered to the diet, and getting scoped and doped by my<BR>
gasto (by doped I mean a prescription to prednisone, and one for asacol,<BR>
which I ignore, as I'm convinced it makes me bleed). In less than a<BR>
month, I was virtually symptom free.  Then I decided to quit smoking.  A<BR>
week later, my symptoms started creeping back, even while on the diet<BR>
and 10mg of prednisone per day, and now, a month later, I find myself<BR>
bleeding alot, frequent trips to the bathroom, waking up at night to<BR>
go...   I really have no desire to smoke. Although I enjoyed it, I feel<BR>
that it is out of my system, in terms of craving.  However, as the link<BR>
below seems to concur, it seems to me that there is a correlation<BR>
between remission and nicotine (or maybe it's the tar).  I've done this<BR>
before (smoke to see if it alleviates my symptoms), and even posted the<BR>
results to this list. At that time, It seemed that the smoking was<BR>
keeping me in remission.  Now I even wonder if it was the smoking all<BR>
along, moreso than the diet, that was keeping me in a more remissive<BR>
state.  (oooh, sacriledge!)<BR>
<BR>
I'm pretty confused, as I don't wan't colon cancer, but lung cancer is<BR>
worse I guess.  I don't know which has a higher probability of<BR>
occurring.  I've upped my prednisone to 25mg per day (starting today) to<BR>
try to control this flare.  If I don't get into remmission soon, I'll<BR>
probably experiment with the nicotine again. Me, the perinneal<BR>
guinneapig! This link (below) refers to transdermal (patches) nicotine<BR>
and it's effects on colitis patients.  Patches are pretty expensive,<BR>
much more than cigarettes (disclaimer - I don't live in Canada!), but<BR>
alot less damaging to one's health, I suspect.  But for experiment's<BR>
sake, I guess either one would do.  I'll keep you posted!  If anyone has<BR>
any advice and/or experiences on this, I'd love to hear about it.<BR>

Hi Matthew,<BR>
<BR>
&gt;  it seems to me that there is a correlation<BR>
&gt; between remission and nicotine (or maybe it's the tar).  I've done this<BR>

<BR>
It's the nicotine, and there *is* a definite correlation between remission<BR>
and smoking.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; I'm pretty confused, as I don't wan't colon cancer, but lung cancer<BR>
&gt; any advice and/or experiences on this, I'd love to hear about it.<BR>
<BR>
However, it's not just a choice between lung cancer and colon cancer, but a<BR>
choice between premature death from many causes, including multiple types of<BR>
cancers, heart disease, emphysema, years of such poor quality of life that<BR>
death looks desirable, possibly; and staying smoke free.I wouldn't go back<BR>
to smoking, or even try the nicotine patch (nicotine, which is a poison even<BR>
when it's not inhaled, can promote heart disease), in an effort to go into<BR>
remission, but would instead, look at alternatives.  Check with a doctor who<BR>
specializes in parasites, to see if you have little critters living in you<BR>
who are keeping your gut from healing.  Try going to a nutritionally<BR>
oriented doctor and taking high doses of B complex and folic acid (really<BR>
high doses of folic acid can be critical), perhaps even injections of B<BR>
complex if you can't absorb the vitamins from pills, yet.  Sometimes, the<BR>
nutritional deficiencies from poor absorption will prevent healing until<BR>
they are taken care of.  And prednisone will create deficiencies in folic<BR>
acid, among other things (for instance it will also wreck your<BR>
potassium/sodium balance, making you deficient in potassium).  Prednisone<BR>
can also promote candida overgrowth, which will also cause gut problems, so<BR>
taking care of candida (with anti candida medicines and supplements, plus<BR>
diet) can also help.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck, and congratulations on quitting smoking!<BR>

<BR>
Hi!<BR>
<BR>
I'm back....I see I missed a great peanut-cashew-bean-nut
debate!  &nbsp;:)<BR>
Actually, it was the cashews that caused my flare, I think I am
almost
over it, though.  I had too much mail waiting for me to read, so
if I have
missed answering anyone, I'm sorry!  :)   Anyway, I just had to
respond
in regards to the nicotine.  Quitting smoking was one of the
things that
caused me to get Crohn's!  I was fine until I decided to quit
smoking,
my mother just recently passed away from breast cancer, (April
25th), cancer
runs strongly in my family.  When my mother was first diagnosed
with
cancer, I decided to quit smoking.  A month later, I was in the
hospital.<BR>
A few months and many tests later, I found out I had Crohn's.  I
will
never go back to smoking, though.  The harmful effects of it far
outweigh
any benefit it may have for IBD.  My Grandfather smoked, and he
died
of cancer.  My mother smoked, and she died from its harmful
effects.<BR>
She had malignant cancer that was starting to spread throughout
her body.   But she
also had congestive heart failure, emphysema, and bronchial
pneumonia,
most of which was caused by smoking and the drugs she had to take

for her reumatoid arthritis.  Her RA also contributed to her
death.
But IBD, like cancer, is somewhat of an autoimune type disease,
and
I really think there is a direct link to smoking.  My advice to
anyone would
be NOT to smoke!  Second hand smoke is almost more harmful than
smoking, so if you smoke, you are hurting your family members by
doing
so.  Sorry to preach about smoking, and I am one to talk, I
smoked
for many years, but now how I wish I had never started.  I have
been
smoke free since February of  of '97, and I never plan on ever
smoking again.  After going through horrible withdrawel, I would
never
even consider the nicotine patch.  I STILL crave a cigarette
sometimes!<BR>
That is my two cents on smoking!   &nbsp;:)

This may shock, annoy, disturb or amuse.  If you are very opposed to<BR>

<BR>
A while back, I emailed the list to say that I had started smoking, and<BR>
intended to post the results to the list.  Well, my colitis symptoms<BR>
dramatically decreased.  I wasn't taking any meds at the time.  I had<BR>
been on the diet faithully for 2 years, and all the swelling, mucus and<BR>
urgency (well, most of it) had subsided by avoiding any complex<BR>
carbohydrates.  However, I never totally got rid of the bleeding, or<BR>
funny-stools syndrome.  Satisfied that this was the maximum level of<BR>
remission I was going to derive from the diet, I started introducing<BR>
corn meal and rice. Neither affected me.  Things seemed quite nice, as<BR>
my stools were bulking up from the added rice and corn, I didn't<BR>
experience any increase in symptoms...until I quit smoking. That was<BR>
late August.  Within 2 or 3 weeks, my bleeding and urgency started up<BR>
again. It did not occur to me, I did not make the connection between<BR>
quiting smoking and my symptoms reccuring.  Odd coincidence.  I<BR>
immediately went back on the diet with &quot;fanatical adherance.&quot; This<BR>
wasn't enough, (obviously, since the diet takes a while, and even Elaine<BR>
recommends medication at the advice of one's doctor) so I went to my<BR>
doctor, for some prednisone and asacol.  After a couple of weeks without<BR>
any significant improvement, I decided to try smoking again.  Wouldn't<BR>
you know, within a week my symptoms were virtually gone.  Now they are<BR>
completely gone. In almost 3 years I have never attained this level of<BR>
remmission.  I actually had pizza for dinner on Sunday, and corn chips<BR>
with a roll with my lunch yesterday, and for diner last night, has a<BR>
chicken stir fry with rice.  I even ate a nibbel off of a Toblerone bar<BR>
(first in 2 1/2 years!) The only noticeable difference was that my stool<BR>
was as normal as I can ever remember it being.  No blood or urgency<BR>
(amazing what turns us on these days). I think FOR ME (I'm NOT<BR>
advocating smoking for anyone) what works is to adhere to the diet for<BR>
most of my meals to avoid overdosing on complex carbos, take the asacol,<BR>
(which I believe is helping as I never attained this level of remission<BR>
before when I was smoking without taking the drugs while adhering to the<BR>
diet 100%),  and smoke between 5 and 7 cigarettes each day. I don't<BR>
think this would work if I were to revert to a normal American<BR>
fast-food, junkified diet. Or stop smoking.  I prided myself when I was<BR>
on the diet, without any meds and dramatically reduced symptoms.<BR>
However, now I am eating stuff I've avoided for years, taking pills and<BR>
smoking.  I'm not trying to start a long thread of messages here,<BR>
pro-con smoking.  If you have any questions about my experience, you can<BR>
Email me directly at mcirill@emory.edu to help keep this list specific<BR>
to the SCD as it should be.  This is the last time I will post anyting<BR>
here that mentions anything that isn't part of the diet, which I<BR>
wholeheartedly support, which continues to do wonders for me.  (I'm<BR>
having tuna on almond brad for lunch, ate an apple for<BR>
breakfast...etc... (But I will snack on tortilla chips this afternoon).<BR>

When I started the diet I also bought a box of nicorette gum. I chewed one<BR>
piece every morning. 4mg nicotine. It's common medical knowledge that<BR>
nicotine masks (they use the word &quot;mask&quot; for some reason) the symptoms of<BR>
UC, but makes Crohns much worse. I wanted to get up an 8mg habit, but the<BR>
effects of nicotine were exactly that of smoking, and being a nonsmoker I<BR>
couldn't form a habit. I credit the nicotine with ending my sense of urgency<BR>
and letting me stay at my desk during the work day. That helped the diet get<BR>
a foothold and I assume begin the healing process. My box of nicorette has<BR>
since run out and I don't have $50 for a new box. I'm healthier now, but<BR>
with the nicotine I'd probably have to leave my desk a little less<BR>
frequently.<BR>

<BR>
I don't think you should use smoking as an excuse to eat non-SCD foods,<BR>
but as a way to control your symptoms while you follow the diet and your<BR>
body continues to heal over the months and years that you are on it.  I<BR>
know from experience that one snack every few days turns into one snack<BR>
per day and then it's every meal you re eating something non-SCD<BR>
specific.  My husband went off the diet during his remission, and<BR>
eventually he got sick again.  It took a while, but he has not had this<BR>
illness for very long.<BR>
<BR>
Some people's full remission of the disease take longer than the one<BR>
year on the diet.  This could be due to several factors--meds, how long<BR>
you have been ill or how ill you are, how &quot;fanatical&quot; you followed the<BR>
diet, including hidden di/polysacharrides, etc.  Perhaps to stick with<BR>
the diet for an additional year would bring you even more relief than<BR>
you felt when you decidedly went off the diet.<BR>
<BR>
If you started eating corn and rice before your problem was healed, then<BR>
the healing is not complete and the smoking is just &quot;masking&quot; the<BR>
symptoms.  This could make you very sick in the future!  And your body<BR>
may eventually give out and you could find yourself worse than ever,<BR>
smoking or not.<BR>
<BR>
From my husband's experience, corn and rice are the two hardest things<BR>
for him to process.<BR>
<BR>
I am also wonderiing if you think the SCD means avoiding all<BR>
complex-carbs, vs. di and polysacharrides.  Perhaps you wrote that for<BR>
the sake of expediency but it is very inaccurate, as far as the SCD<BR>
goes.<BR>

dramatically decreased.  I wasn't taking any meds at the time.  I had<BR>
been on the diet faithully for 2 years, and all the swelling, mucus and<BR>
urgency (well, most of it) had subsided by avoiding any complex<BR>
carbohydrates.  However, I never totally got rid of the bleeding, or<BR>
funny-stools syndrome.  Satisfied that this was the maximum level of<BR>
remission I was going to derive from the diet, I started introducing<BR>
corn meal and rice. Neither affected me.<BR>
