<B>SCD MAILING LIST</B><BR>
----------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>
Dear Denise &amp; all,<BR>
Yes there is a new list. The address is SCD-list@longisland.com
Let me just go over a little history. I don't recall just how I first found
Debbie Dowd on the web, but we were writing each other often. We once
mentioned that we were writing several people on the subject of the SCD
(she even more than I) and how much easier it would be to just CC everyone
and that's how it all began. We had a great time, sharing recipes and ideas
on living with the SCD.  <BR>After some time Michael generously offered to make
it all easier by using a listserver which eliminated all the CC ing and
automatically kept up with the changes (people coming in and out). I'm not
sure why Michael had to stop running the list after about a year or so, but
one door closed and another one opened. <BR>John Chalmers offered to pick up
where Michael left off. We kept up a lively dialogue, but the problem began
when a lot of discussion went on about things other than, and opposing to
the SCD. <BR>Although things seem to have quieted down a lot, Elaine, myself
and others wanted a list that was exclusively meant to address the issue of
the SCD. A friend of mine who owns a company that manages listservers,
offered to manage this list at a deep discount. So here we are. I don't
know if the Maelstrom address will continue to exist. That depends if there
is a need for it and/or if John wants to continue running it. Meanwhile
this site exists for the discussion of the SCD. There's really no-one
&quot;running&quot; it. Hopefully it will run automatically and be driven by the need
of those of us that wish to use it.<BR>

SCD MAILING LIST<BR>

Dear All,<BR>
I discussed with John whether or not the old list will remain active. He
says it will stay on for a few days just for the straglers, but this
address is to be the new home of the SCD list. Please change the address
you have from the mailstrom one to SCD-list@longisland.com<BR>

To Rachel and John,<BR><BR>

I've held my tongue during this recent list upset, but I feel that I need to
respond to the way you've created a new list.<BR><BR>

First, I'm confused by your saying, Rachel, that John is going to keep the
old list active for a few days for stragglers. It was my understanding that
Don was the list owner and therefor the one to decide whether or not to
keep the list going.<BR><BR>

Rachel, you're free to start your own list, of course. But speaking for
myself, I was getting a lot of value from this current one, and will stay
on it as long as it is active. I've been on the diet six months. I improved
dramatically within days of starting, but I've stayed pretty much at the
same place for several months now. I KNOW that's a better place than I'd be
at if I weren't on the diet, but I want the opportunity to talk about and
hear other options with and from others who are on the diet.<BR><BR>

I can empathize with Elaine for all the critcism she's endured from the
medical establishment over the years. However, I can't understand why she
does not seem to want to see if the diet can be improved. Maybe it can't,
but then again, maybe it can. In all of my 48 years I've yet to meet an
infallible human being, so as brilliant as he may have been I'd be very
surprised if Dr. Haas was one. That's not to detract from what he did, but
it is to say, why not build on it?<BR><BR>

I'm rambling a bit, but I am upset by the recent turn of events. The SCD
diet is a good thing, and has helped a lot of people, including myself.
However, what's really important is not the diet itself, but PEOPLE
getting and staying healthy. From some of the postings I've seen lately
it seems to me that that has been forgotten. I'm not sure what rules should
be used as guidelines for discussion, but I'd rather rely on my delete key
than see restrictions imposed.<BR><BR>

Anyway, I will stay subscribed to the new list, but I definitely want to
see the present one continue.<BR><BR>

Dear Tom,<BR>
I am so sorry that this has upset you. That was never my intention. John
went to Don with this list. To my understanding Don became a list owner
because he supplied the knowledge and equipment to run that list. He also
obviously has a personal interest because of his own diet and celiac.
Frankly the tone of the list changed and I beleive Don had a lot to do with
that. He has knowledge and information, but it is not geared to the
Specific Carbohydrate Diet which was the original purpose of this list.
Perhaps he will decide to maintain the list in spite of Johns pulling out.
That is not for me to say. You may decide to benefit from both schools of
thought. I know that Elaine is a staunch purist about this diet and and it
is her dedication to this diet that has saved my life, along with countless
others. For this reason I agree with her that a site reserved solely for
discussion of this diet is needed.<BR>
As an aside, I was speaking to another person with UC recently and we were
comparing horror stories. I told her that one day before I found this diet,
I was standing on a train platform waiting for a train that would take me
to the city to meet my husband and freinds to attend a concert. As the
train was pulling in, my body betrayed me and I had a small accident that
resulted in soiled underwear (where, but here can I discuss this). As the
train came closer, I seriously considered stepping in front of it and
ending my miserable existance. I couldn't stand another moment of blood,
pain, mucous and all it involved. That was the absolutly lowest day of my
illness. Once I boarded the train, I stood in a filthy bathroom, my feet
sticking to that disgusting floor as I changed into the spare underwear I
always carried with me. Shortly there-after I found salvation in the SCD. I
have no doubt that if I hadn't, the temptation to die would have eventually
won. I've had 2 &amp; 1/2 wonderful productive years of life since I started
the diet. This other person told me that she was one week away from having
her colon removed when she found the diet. It is salvation from these kinds
of hell that make some of us want to keep the diet and the discussion of it
pure and this was the motivation behind starting a new list. Regardless of
your decision to stay or go (and I do hope you decide to stay), I want you
to know and hopefully understand my own role in the move.<BR>

Dear Rachel,<BR><BR>

Your story about the SCD saving you from ending up taking your life
is very touching. My story, which you avoided responding to, is that
initially my CD improved dramatically on the SCD, but then stopped improving
in spite of following it as religiously as I was able. And there are a
lot of people like me, who unfortunately aren't experiencing the remarkable
recovery you did. What do you suggest we do? Count our blessings and
take prednisone when we need it? Or maybe see if by sharing information
and experiences we can improve on the diet Dr. Haas came up with decades
ago?? And who knows?  Maybe the diet could be changed so that your other
IBD symptoms would improve like your colon has.  Maybe not, but we won't
find out unless we keep our minds open.<BR><BR>

Dear Tom,<BR>
I guess that not all responses to the diet are the same. I wish that yours
had been as dramatic as mine. Maybe your improvement will continue on the
SCD itself. Maybe you need to look for more answers to supplement your cure
and I encourage you to look in every direction for releif. This new list is
for the Specific Carbohydrate diet. I still contend that for many people
this diet itself, unchanged, undiluted is the answer and for those people,
the introduction of alternative therapies is confusing and unproductive. If
I didn't find the degree of success I've had with the SCD, I'd surely be
looking into other answers and I continue to do so for my other symptoms.<BR>

<B>Re: Welcome to SCD-list</B><BR>
Tue,  5 Aug 1997 15:21:19 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hello,<BR>
<BR>
I am currently more than a little confused about what is going on with <BR>
the mailing list(s) to discuss the specific carbohydrate diet.<BR>
<BR>
Evidently a new list has been created and I have been automatically<BR>
subscribed to it.<BR>
<BR>
Question 1.  	Does the new list (SCD-list@longisland.com) replace the old<BR>
		list (SCD@MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU)?<BR>
<BR>
If the answer to question 1 is &quot;no&quot;, then I have the following questions:<BR>
<BR>
Question 1a.	Why was I automatically subscribed to the new list?<BR>
		Even though I very likely would have subscribed to the<BR>
		new list on my own, I feel that it is a bit improper<BR>
		to automatically add me to a list without asking me.<BR>
<BR>
Question 1b.	Why is there a need for two lists?<BR>
<BR>
I subscribed to the list SCD@MAELSTROM.STJOHNS.EDU because I was<BR>
considering starting the SCD and I thought it would be helpful<BR>
to be on a mailing list with others using the diet.  I must admit<BR>
that I am a little disapointed in all of the discussion over what<BR>
is appropriate for the list.  I have found the posts related to the<BR>
diet quite informative.  I do find that the attitude that only the<BR>
diet in its 100% pure form can be discussed to be somewhat of<BR>
an elitist attitude.  I understand that the mailing list was<BR>
created to discuss the diet, but my feeling is that as long as<BR>
we don't stray to far from that topic and that the various<BR>
members of the list are getting the support and information<BR>
that they want, then the list is performing a good service.<BR>
Maybe I am wrong, but I get the impression that the new list<BR>
was created because some people did not like the way the old<BR>
list was going.  If that is so, and the list was created by<BR>
putting all the old members on it, is anything going to change?<BR>
Or is the purpose to alienate certain members of the list?<BR>
<BR>
I think it needs to be explained more clearly why the second<BR>
list was created and what the purposes of each list are.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you.<BR>
<BR>

Sorry to butt in ,but it seems to me that what is needed is 2 lists. From<BR>
my limited time of involvement here, I would guess that It wouldn't be too<BR>
very hard to get Don Wiss to run his own list. As much as he seems to know,<BR>
and as eager as he is to share his knowledge, maybe you should be<BR>
contacting him in this regard. For myself, I spend time in many other<BR>
places online (and find out much useful information), and I see no reason<BR>
that this list need be a one stop shop for all your IBD needs. I don't mind<BR>
the expression of different viewpoints here or anywhere else, but if the<BR>
name calling and vindictiveness that was taking over the previous list goes<BR>
away on this one then the move will definitely be worth it<BR>

Dear Kim and All,<BR>
<BR>
Personally, I was finding it difficult to be in a group that was being very<BR>
vocally led by someone who is not on the diet. And who, as we have all<BR>
heard by now,  prefers the paleolithic diet over the SCD. He feels free to<BR>
take pot shots at Elaine, which I feel is totally inappropriate for &quot;an SCD<BR>
listowner.&quot; And talk about censorship! How can you dialogue on an even<BR>
plane with someone who threatens to bump and monitor? I don't care to<BR>
belong to a list owned by someone in the business of accumulating lists. Is<BR>
there some business angle to this that I'm not aware of? Let's get back to<BR>
being our own group for our own reasons. That is what this new group is<BR>
for.<BR>

Subject: <B>Re: new list</B><BR><BR>

Here's a suggestion that may accomodate the sometimes conflicting needs of
different list members.<BR><BR>

I was a subscriber to another list that had an analogous problem where
sometimes separate but related subjects were raised.  The solution there
was not to create an entirely new list, but to use the SUBJECT heading to
alert the list members to the content of the message.  We could come up
with a convention that, if used to prefix a subject, would let people know
whether or not they want to read it.  And if someone wants to wander from
SCD orthodoxy, the subject prefix could help eliminate confusion on the
part of people who want to strictly follow SCD.  These prefixes, once
agreed upon, could be part of the welcome message sent to new subscribers.
I haven't been around long enough to have a good idea of what prefixes
would be needed.  Anyone else have ideas?<BR><BR>

Also, some email handlers offer the ability to filter messages based on
Subject, so if someone were totally uninterested in some subjects, they
could simply discard those messages.<BR><BR>

Anyone else think that this might work and help the present situation?<BR><BR>

Subject: <B>Re: New List</B><BR>
<BR>
Hi everyone,<BR>
<BR>
I just want to, somewhat wearily, add my voice to the commentary about<BR>
the new list change.<BR>
<BR>
The way this has been handled has inspired a lot of confusion and more<BR>
riled feelings, which we didn't really need right now.  The way it is,<BR>
feels like an extension of the previous flame war and hurt feelings<BR>
instead of an administrative decision to improve the quality and<BR>
efficiency of the SCD list.  It now feels like the group is splintering.<BR>
<BR>
I'm also concerned that it sets a dangerous precedent that this is how<BR>
we work out our problems, that the next time there's a flame war,<BR>
someone else will start a new list again and THIS is how we lose<BR>
people.  It definitely is like starting over again.  It weakens the<BR>
group.<BR>
<BR>
I would agree that the tone of the list has changed since it crashed and<BR>
started up again on the new list server with the new owners, which has<BR>
been unfortunate and I don't completely understand why. Michael dropped<BR>
the list without ever explaining what happened and we (I say we because<BR>
there was a lot of communication back and forth between a lot of us<BR>
trying to figure out what to do) really had to scramble to get it<BR>
started again.  I am so grateful that Don stepped in and got it<BR>
functioning again, even IF I didn't always agree with everything he<BR>
said.  I didn't agree with everything Michael said either.  No big<BR>
deal.<BR>
<BR>
Even though Don had some strong opinions, there's no way he was leading<BR>
the list any more than anyone else.  He may have been dominating it<BR>
there for awhile, but I'd like to know how you can avoid that kind of<BR>
thing happening on any list?  And in my recollection,  Don never<BR>
threatened to bounce anyone off the list.  All I remember is he made a<BR>
comment about how he wouldn't tolerate Dr. Holland on the list (he said<BR>
it, to my eyes, more like a joke, that was in defense of this list).<BR>
Any of us could make an off-hand comment like that and have it start to<BR>
take on a life of it's own.<BR>
<BR>
I know this change is under way and is going to happen, and quite<BR>
frankly, I am just happy and grateful to have a list, period.  But I<BR>
want to say again what has wisely been said by others in recent days,<BR>
that I hope that rather than limiting the discussion or starting a new<BR>
list, in the future we could  encourage of each other to be courteous to<BR>
one another and to respect that we are all entitled to our opinions.  To<BR>
work out constructive solutions to the problems we face rather than<BR>
starting over with a supposedly clean slate.  I really hope this works<BR>
out for the best.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, I think Kim's idea about having the SUBJECT headings is a<BR>
good one and may help things out in the future.<BR>
<BR>
Best wishes everyone for calmer list days in the future,<BR>
<BR>
Denise

Dear Tom, Kim and everone,<BR>
I'm sorry for the confusion that this change is causing. Basically the new<BR>
list is meant to replace the old list. You signed on for the discussion of<BR>
the Specific Carbohydrate diet and that is the intention of this forum.<BR>
John, who was given a copy of the old list from Michael for the purpose of<BR>
continuing this forum agrees that a new home is needed for this group<BR>
(John?). Therefore the change. He had brought in additional help to help<BR>
run the previous list. The person was not on the diet and had some<BR>
conflicting veiws about the diet. This is not to say that what he had to<BR>
offer had no validity. I don't know. I am strictly a supporter of the SCD<BR>
because it has proved lifesaving in value to me. Problems began when<BR>
difference of opinion escalated into threats of bouncing people off the<BR>
list I don't know if the old list is going to stay in place, but the people<BR>
respnsible for re-instating the list to begin with, myself John and others<BR>
plan to align themselves with the new site. If the old site stays in place,<BR>
those that are ambiguous about the diet will have will have an extra web<BR>
site from which to obtain information and make their own decisions about<BR>
the value of the advise given. Please, please lets try to overcome this<BR>
political vein and go back to the business of discussing the diet. None of<BR>
us, myself included need the emotional turmoil that recent events have<BR>
brought on.<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Rachel

<B>Two lists</B><BR>
Tue,  5 Aug 1997 16:38:46 GMT<BR>
<BR>
     It's a shame that we have a splinter group forming a new list in order <BR>
     to maintain some kind of purity of the SCD.  This week marks my one <BR>
     year anniversary on the diet, and I, like Tom, have found that it only <BR>
     goes so far.  I have been religiously following the diet for my UC.  <BR>
     Right from the second day, I noted greatly improved symptoms and <BR>
     continued to improve over the year.  My scope in February showed a 95% <BR>
     improvement.  However, over the entire time I have had to take <BR>
     prednisone in amounts varying between 2.5 and 10mg.  Since I don't <BR>
     consider myself in that 25% or whatever that will not benefit from the <BR>
     diet (after all, I am doing better), I suspect that some kind of <BR>
     additional alteration in my diet is necessary.  Whether this <BR>
     adjustment will be in the area of dairy products remains to be seen.  <BR>
     I am interested in the idea, posed by the paleo folk, that my <BR>
     ancestors of a few thousand years ago did not eat anything made from <BR>
     cow milk.<BR>
     <BR>
     I don't quite understand why any questioning of Elaine is prohibited.  <BR>
     And, for those few of you are 100% healed by the diet, why talk about <BR>
     the SCD at all?  I would think you would just go on to other parts of <BR>
     your lives.  Since I am able to control my chronic asthma with new <BR>
     medications, it is not a bother to me and I no longer think about it.<BR>
     Will the new list involve censorship of messages?<BR>

Hi Rachel and others,<BR>
<BR>
I too have been biting my tongue on the latest issues with the<BR>
SCD list, no more.  Rachel, IMHO (not an attack) you handled this<BR>
situation inappropriately.  In the majority of your beliefs and<BR>
your stance on the SCD, I agree with you about the list.<BR>
<BR>
So Rachel, do believe me when I say that I am on your side.<BR>
<BR>
I feel that NONE of us would be on the SCD diet if it weren't<BR>
for IBD.  This diet is a neccessity for most of us, not merely<BR>
a choice.  My choice was made in seeking an alternative to all<BR>
medication and prevention of future need for surgery.  You may<BR>
believe this diet to work 100% followed as is, yet I am not YOU<BR>
or anyone else on this list.  We are all UNIQUE individuals with<BR>
varying degree of problems to deal with daily.<BR>
<BR>
I enjoyed some of Don's informative insight such as recent issues<BR>
on butter alternative, BOAR's brand hotdog not ok for SCD, or<BR>
other hidden ingredients.  For this, he was helpful.  However, I<BR>
do agree with most that his counter-views towards the diet<BR>
(preference for Paleo and rebutals for Celiac) were inappropriate.<BR>
This includes his degrading personal testimonials.  Testimonials<BR>
on not science, yet his view was &quot;prove it&quot; which classifies him<BR>
like ignorant medical doctors who do not believe that the personal<BR>
experience of REAL people (not textbooks) matters the most.<BR>
<BR>
So Rachel, do believe me when I say that I am on your side.  I do<BR>
hope, however, that not just how to implement or sharing recipes<BR>
will be the ONLY focus in this list.  I do NOT care about medical<BR>
drug questions, although (like me) some need it adjunct to SCD.<BR>
I do like vitamin discussion, or IBD sympton (gas, heartburn,<BR>
aches, edema, ...) questions and how others deal with it.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

<B>Two lists</B><BR>
Tue,  5 Aug 1997 18:19:04 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Bart, I am with you.  Everyone is different.  I am a firm believer in<BR>
keeping a open mind in regards to medical conditions.  My husband has UC<BR>
and has been following the diet.  He is still on meds but his flareups are<BR>
much less severe now so I know it has helped. He never had UC so severe<BR>
that his colon was at risk for coming out.  Not all people on this diet<BR>
have the life threatening variety.  I think figuring out what works for<BR>
individual  people is what counts.  Everyone wants to get better...that's<BR>
the goal isn't it.  I myself might be on this diet soon.  I never even<BR>
realized I had a problem until being on this list.  <BR>

BEST OF BOTH WORLDS!<BR>
How does this sound?  The NEW list is specifically for people with IBD<BR>
who wish to follow the SCD and get feedback from Elaine if and when it<BR>
is available, to exchange new recipes, get support and encouragement,<BR>
impart what's working/what's not working, and other technical aspects of<BR>
the SCD diet.  The OTHER (Don's)  list can be an exchange of ideas for<BR>
members of the medical profession, microbiologists, regular folks etc...<BR>
and not be specifically the SCD, but address other diets, technical<BR>
information, medical remedies, relating to IBD. There is no reason that<BR>
enlightening information, debate, support and encouragement surrounding<BR>
the SCD can't take place on the old list, it can be an outlet for &quot;truth<BR>
seekers&quot; who wish to persue means of validating or invalidating Elaine's<BR>
diet. (Dr. Haas', whatever).  Since this diet is one of the few<BR>
solutions for IBD'ers, it stands to reason that a lot of discussion on<BR>
the &quot;old&quot; list will revolve around Elaine's work.  I personally wish<BR>
that both lists will remain, and I will expect to glean useful<BR>
information from both.  This way, Everyone's needs are met.<BR>

I agree with Tom Stone in his comments about automatically being<BR>
included in the subscribe list of the SCD-list@longisland.com.<BR>
<BR>
Who died and gave the folks in Long Island the feeling that everyone is<BR>
unhappy with the StJohns SCD digest. Therefore they create a new list<BR>
and I should be enthralled with their comments and points of view about<BR>
SCD. In my case I am offended by their arrogance in making such an<BR>
assumption on my behalf..<BR>

Thank you for this undertaking, already the tone of the discussion is<BR>
consistent with the SCD diet being the primary focus.  We assume that, with<BR>
getting the old list from John that we are on the new list.  I would like to<BR>
unsubscribe Don W. list and make sure that we are on the right list.  If we<BR>
unscubscribe, do we send to &quot;SCD@maelstrom.stjohns.edu&quot; or do we assume that<BR>
with the passage of time, Don W. will delete us all from the list.  If this<BR>
has been answered already, I oplogise,  Thanks again, the true nature of the<BR>
list is back!!<BR>

Dear Allan,<BR>
Thanks for the support. Frankly, I could use all the support I can get at<BR>
this time. Not everyone seems to understand the need for this site and I've<BR>
had a lot of blasting from those who think this is about my ego. I promise<BR>
you that the decision to try to re-establish a list for the discussion of<BR>
the SCD, was not about quitting the game and taking my ball home.<BR>
Yes, if you do not want to be on the other list you must send them a post<BR>
with &quot;unsubscibe&quot; in the body of the e-mail.<BR>

&gt;SCD MAILING LIST<BR>
&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;If Don's list is to be a sort of general IBD discussion group,<BR>
&gt;then doesn't that overlap with the purpose of the<BR>
&gt;alt.crohns-colitis.support newgroup?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Regards/Liz<BR>
<BR>
I don't think that overlap is problematic or even existant. The discussion<BR>
on that group is mostly about meds and surgery and coping, and doesn't<BR>
center on diet for the most part. Don's list is a place that is about diet,<BR>
and there is plenty of info there. After all, no one has a problem with all<BR>
the Wolfgang Lutz stuff on Mik's site. The problem with Don's list is that<BR>
it is Don's list, and he is trying to run it with all the diplomacy of a<BR>
&quot;diet nazi.&quot; He threatens to bump list members, and he attacks Elaine's<BR>
views and all good news with his own explanation of what &quot;really happened.&quot;<BR>
He completely ignores the fact that it is an SCD list and not a Don list.<BR>
<BR>
Having said that, he is very knowledgable on subjects that can be useful.<BR>
when I posted a request about hot dogs for my son's snausage craving,<BR>
several people told me about a brand they had been using. Don told us that<BR>
they contained large quantities of hvp and msg. I found that information<BR>
useful.<BR>
<BR>
If the maelstrom site stays up, I will check in from time to time.<BR>
Primarily though, I want to be on the list that deals with scd questions<BR>
and which is sanctioned by Elaine. Speaking of SCD questions, here's one:<BR>
What's the word on sesame? Is it legal. If this is the list, maybe it will<BR>
provide an answer. I've asked this one a couple of times on the DonList,<BR>
but still haven't gotten a bite.<BR>
<BR>
One last gripe...This list server is the pits compared to the other one.<BR>
Without the digest option, and with all the posting these days, I takes an<BR>
eternity to go through the mail, and it's all mixed in with the regular<BR>
mail. I'm all for the new list, but why on an inferior server?<BR>
thanks,<BR>

Yes, There would be some overlap.  But I've always perceived the alt.<BR>
chrons-colitis site as a place that is based upon the standard,<BR>
&quot;thinking in the box&quot; medical community-endorsed kind of thing, whereby<BR>
Don's site seems to be a place where &quot;thinking out of the box,&quot; but not<BR>
exclusively the SCD, takes place.<BR>

I don't see why Don should delete anyone from the Maelstrom list ?
However, if you want to unsubscribe the Maelstrom list, you can read on this
page how to:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/scd005_1.html">http://www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/scd005_1.html</A>
<BR><BR>
(You write &quot;SIGNOFF SCD&quot; in the body of the message and send it to:
listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu)
<BR><BR>
People have asked me if I am or am not a supporter of the new list.
I personally think it was an over-reaction to start a new list. I miss the nice
technological features of the Maelstrom list: web archive, digest, etc.
On the other hand, maybe it WAS the right thing to do...
I hate to think of the confusion it must create for a newcomer, recently, when
meeting up with not one but TWO scd lists that seem very alike in their
purposes. <BR>
But then again: maybe both lists will turn out to supplement each other rather
than compete.<BR>
The fact that we now have two &quot;post offices&quot; instead of one doesn't necessarily
increase the amount of letters written, nor change the contents of those
letters... (as long as one remain subscribing to both of them).<BR>
The buttom line is that it certainly is important that noone feels that they
could come in a situation where they'd be &quot;bumped out&quot; of a list because of
their viewpoints. <BR>
Freedom of speech is essential. <BR>
Even if it is just a _feeling_ of freedom of speech.<BR>
And if a new list can ensure that everyone now has a good feeling of freedom of
speech, then it is worth it.<BR>
We all know, at the same time, how this beautiful concept of freedom of speech
can certainly turn out to be a disturbing element once in a while. But no
question, it is worth the hussle. Even when it means having two SCD lists.
<BR><BR>
All in all, I am one of those who quietly lean back - and follow how things
develop...<BR>
For now, I'll remain subscribing to both lists and would recommend that we all
do that, in order to help people in need where we can.
Remember...? This is still (or ought still to be) the driving force behind all
our SCD activities on the Internet. <BR>
If your mailbox is floating over with emails, you can conveniently change the
setting of your Maelstrom subscription to &quot;digest&quot;, which means you'll only
receive one posting a day.

(You write &quot;SET SCD DIGEST&quot; in the body of the message and send it to:
listserv@maelstrom.stjohns.edu)<BR><BR>

By the way, the Maelstrom list is not &quot;Don's list&quot;. It DID belong to all of us,
and John still happens to be the listowner.<BR><BR>

Peace!   ;-)
<BR><BR>
Yours,<BR>
Mik<BR>

Hi everybody,<BR>
<BR>
I just got home and just read the Digest. I was aware that Rachel was<BR>
starting a new list, but I was not privy to the timing or how the<BR>
transition was to take place. But knowing it was coming has allowed me time<BR>
to think about it. First, I will not be joining Rachel's list, and presume<BR>
I wouldn't be welcome on it anyway. Second, I don't have to shut down this<BR>
list. Basically what Matthew has written above are my intentions. While I'd<BR>
rather this list be named something like IBD-Diet, changing a name isn't an<BR>
easy thing to do, though I will look into it.<BR>
<BR>
The list will cover the three known IBD diets, plus the elemental diet as<BR>
described in The Lancet article. Debate will be allowed on the list, and<BR>
I'm hoping the discussion will include both support, and a technical<BR>
discussion of diet as related to IBDs.<BR>
<BR>
The three diets that will be covered are:<BR>
<BR>
Elaine Gottschall's &quot;Specific Carbohydrate Diet&quot;<BR>
Dr. Wofgang J. Lutz's &quot;Dismantling a Myth&quot;<BR>
Dr. Walter L. Voegtlin's &quot;Stone Age Diet&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Lutz's book in English is out of print, but is due to be reprinted by<BR>
the Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation eventually (I've asked and have no<BR>
answer). Dr. Voegtlin's book was self-published in 1975 and should be<BR>
available on inter-library loan. I have asked Price-Pottenger about<BR>
republishing it and they have not responded.<BR>
<BR>
Matthew notes medical remedies. I am not a fan of meds, so I would want the<BR>
topics to remain diet related. I presume the IBD-List covers discussion of<BR>
the IBD meds.<BR>
<BR>
I do not know what Rachel's plans are, but the easiest would be to leave<BR>
people on this list and they would then have to unsubscribe, if they only<BR>
wished to be on the new one.<BR>
<BR>
While I wish everybody the best on the new sanctioned by Elaine list, I do<BR>
think it will be good that people will have a choice of lists, and a choice<BR>
of diets.<BR>

Dear Don,<BR>
I agree with most everything you have to say in this post. Although the<BR>
list at the longisland address is not &quot;MY&quot; list, it is a place where those<BR>
that have not found answers on other diets, but wish to discuss &quot;The<BR>
Specific Carbohydrate diet&quot; can exchange recipes and share ideas about how<BR>
to cope with UC/Crohns in conjunction with the diet. To clarify a point,<BR>
some people seem to think that the list of names was taken from you, when<BR>
in fact, John and I just wanted to pick up where Michael left off in<BR>
maintaining a list for the SCD and he came to you for advice and help which<BR>
you gave him. Unless I'm mistaken thats how you became co-owners of this<BR>
list. When it started noone expected the conflicts that came of it. The new<BR>
address is just meant to be the new home for the SCD group.  It seems to me<BR>
that we all share one goal. To become and to remain healthy. To that end I<BR>
beleive that there is pleanty of room for us all. Your list to discuss<BR>
various alternatives, and the new (old?) list for those that want  what the<BR>
SCD has to offer.<BR>

<BR>
Dear All,<BR>
Congradulations on your new site [mailing list]. I hope you will gain a sense of unity as<BR>
you seek support, consolation, and answers to your questions. The French<BR>
have a word for it -Esprit De Corps- &quot;a sense of togetherness&quot;, as you work<BR>
your way back to good health. A young man in Bellingham, Wash. said in an<BR>
interveiw: &quot;I ate my way into Crohn's disease and now I am eating my way<BR>
out of it.&quot; But we know it is easier said than done. I hope communication<BR>
among you will give you the strength you need to do this. Although I am not<BR>
online, I am available to talk to you if you cannot get the answers among<BR>
discussion with the group. I have written articles on qustions like &quot;is IBD<BR>
genetic?&quot; and &quot;what is celiac disease?&quot;. There is an abundance of published<BR>
information in the medical journals I might be able to help you with. For<BR>
example, on one site, people were arguing about smoking and its effect on<BR>
IBD - that material is well known and you should not have to argue about<BR>
it.<BR>
So, PEACE BE WITH YOU and it is my wish that you will no longer have to<BR>
feel that you are struggling with IBD helplessly, hopelessly and silently.<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Elaine Gottschall<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
