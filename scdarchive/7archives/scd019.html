&gt;Does it mean anything about the diet.<BR></B>

Usually the topic of floaters means the kind in your eye...!! Surprise!!<BR>
<BR>
We can get into competitive pooping here. In health circles, floating stools<BR>
usually mean good...this means there is enough water and fiber and looseness<BR>
in them and they pass through easily. If they sink, it means they have been<BR>
compacted and perhaps there is not enough fiber (too much meat and sugar).<BR>
They will probably be darker depending on how LONG you have been with them.<BR>
Another indication of color is what your bile function is like, but I forgot<BR>
what color means what. I think my naturopath asks, &quot;Are your stools
dark,<BR>
light brown, or greenish?&quot; The health food folks say that your stools
should<BR>
almost fall apart when they are flushed...The REAL  health food people say<BR>
one should defecate 3x per day, right after each meal...just like we did<BR>
when we were babies (or so I'm told). And the REAL REAL REAL health food<BR>
folks say your poop should almost be the color of the FRUIT that you<BR>
eat...and will eventually smell like fruit...(or so I'm told, not having<BR>
been there). Of course this does not take into consideration those who have<BR>
diarrhea or back and forth between constipation and diarrhea. Perhaps Sheila<BR>
the colontherapist can illuminate us on this delicate topic.  :+)<BR>

Once again, Carol, you have done a very good round-up of info on stools<BR>
floating. I don't have very much to add. I come from a background of eating<BR>
disorders and constipation so I had to learn to eliminate. Now that I am<BR>
eliminating on my own, I find my stools vary from floating to sinking. I'm<BR>
just happy that I'm eliminating. At this point, I don't care if they float<BR>
or sink!<BR>
However, many cultures of the world use looking at and reading their<BR>
eliminations as part of their health feedback mechanism. I recall eating
so<BR>
many mangoes a few times when I lived in Miami FL that my stools were the<BR>
color of the mango pulp! I havn't met anyone yet that eats only fruit.<BR>
As I said before, I feel stool examination is good feedback on any changes<BR>
that are going on in the intestines whether bloody, floating,<BR>
particle-izing, strange colors or smells or shapes, pourous, hard.<BR>
Kind Regards, Sheila<BR>

That means there is gas evenly mixed in with the stools. I don't know if<BR>
that's good or bad. But I personally &quot;feel&quot; less toxic than when
I have<BR>
large pockets of gas.<BR>

Hi Roberta<BR>
<BR>
As far as I know (but I'm pretty sure that this is right, maybe a doc<BR>
can shed some light here), floating stools mean that you have<BR>
steatorrhea - the word literally meaning 'loss of fat' in Greek. This<BR>
means that somehow fat doesn't get absorbed from your digestive system<BR>
and ends up excreted in your stool.Or maybe that your fat intake is way<BR>
too high above normal for your body to absorb it or that the bile<BR>
secretion is low.<BR>
<BR>
Hope I've been of help<BR>
<BR>
Regards <BR>
Chris <BR>

Hi Roberta, <BR>
                   You should check with your Doctor, if you have <BR>
Floating stools, it can be a sign of some type of malabsorption.<BR>
This is sometimes caused by celiac disease (gluten intolerance).<BR>

Since my SCD problem is parasites, particularly pinworms (which have<BR>
returned, it's four months now of trying to get rid of them), I'd just like<BR>
to mention that sterrorhea (sp?) or yellow smelly floaters can be caused
by<BR>
worms and the occasional nature of them could be related to the worm<BR>
hatching cycle. Just thought you'd like to consider that possibility :-)!<BR>

I have a book that tells the different types of stools and how frequent
and<BR>
how to test how frequent the movements are.  I will be quoting from the<BR>
book hope this helps any questions.<BR>
COLOR:  Your feces' normal color is brown because colonic bacteria make<BR>
brown pigments out of bile that your liver secrets into your small<BR>
intestine to help you absorb fats.  Although feces do change in appearance<BR>
from day to day, only dramatic, lasting shifts in color are potentially<BR>
important.  For example, you feces may be red or black for a day because<BR>
you consumed a generous portion of beets, meat, chocolate, hydrox cookies,<BR>
licorice, cheries or even over the counter remedies like pepto bismol or<BR>
iron pills.  But if your stool remains consistently black, you may have<BR>
bleeding in your upper gastrointestinal tract.  Occasionally bloody streaks<BR>
on the outside of your stool may come from hemorrhoids or temporary anal<BR>
irritation.  If blood appears persistently, and appears to be mixed into<BR>
your stool, your lower gastrointestinal tract may be bleeding.  In either<BR>
case you need to see your doctor.<BR>
Unless you have been eating foods high in chlorophyll, a yellow or greenish<BR>
stool is usually a sign  of diarrhea and transit time that is to rapid.
 If 
you take antibiotics, this color may mean that your bowel has been<BR>
sterilized.  A tan or clay color may indicate that you eaten too much fat,<BR>
or that your bile duct is blocked and is not producing enough digestive<BR>
enzymes.  If your stool turns almost white, the culprit may be antacids
or<BR>
excess calcium supplements.<BR>
A small, dry stool that sinks to the bottom of your toilet bowl indicates
a<BR>
diet that is too high in meat.  But a floating stool is not a sign of sign<BR>
of a diet high in fiber, rapid transit time, and general digestive health.
<BR>
A stool that floats but is too loose is sign of diarrhea and, consequently,<BR>
malabsorption-perhaps due to irritable bowel syndrome.  Narrow, ribbonlike<BR>
stools are a common clue to irritable bowel syndrome, or even a partial<BR>
obstruction in your intestinal tract.  Stools that float but are<BR>
voluminous, pasty, and greasy, leaving an oil slick on the surface of the<BR>
water in your toilet, may mean that your eating to much fat, or that you<BR>
are having trouble absorbing fat normally because enzyme production has<BR>
declined.  This type of stool also be a sign of celiac sprue or<BR>
pancreatitis.<BR>
You should be able to see only a very few undigested food particles or<BR>
fibers in your stool.  If you spot a substantial number, you may not be<BR>
chewing your food thoroughly enough.  Or you may lack crucial digestive<BR>
enzymes.<BR>
You should also not see any mucous or pus in your stool.  The presence of<BR>
mucous may indicate that you have IBD syndrome, food allergies, or an<BR>
inflammation of your intestinal wall, probably thanks to Candida infection.<BR>
 Pus may be a warning sign of diverticulitus or parasites.  If you have<BR>
diarrhea with both mucous or pus, your trouble may be UC or a parasitic<BR>
infection.  Bloody diarrhea accompanied by mucous can mean colitis or<BR>
Crohn's disease.<BR>
SMELL A FALSE CLUE:  A popular myth among advocates of colonics and colon<BR>
health is that a healthy stool has no odor.  In fact, there is no such<BR>
thing as an odorless stool.  Meat eaters do tend to have more  odoriferous<BR>
stool, because protein may yield residues of nitrogen and sulfur, but it
is<BR>
neither possible nor desirable to eliminate odor from stool.<BR>
Well I know its long but I think this will answers some questions regarding<BR>
stool.    <BR>

<B>Floater questions</B><BR>
 Wed, 29 Jan 1997 22:15:30 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Hello Everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the news on floaters.  They only happen once or twice a month
so<BR>
my  guess is that it's  related to a particular food rather than a general<BR>
problem.<BR>
<BR>
I think floaters occur when I eat Yoghurt.  I'm okay when I have the dry<BR>
curd cottage cheese though.  Am I right to assume that I don't have a milk<BR>
protein problem(as somebody suggested before) if I can tolerate the dry
curd<BR>
(mostly in bread) very well, but just have a problem with the yoghurt?.<BR>
<BR>
 Could I not be absorbing the fat in the yoghurt(which creates floaters)?<BR>
Is there such a thing as allergy to acidophilus?<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for any input.<BR>
<BR>
Roberta<BR>
Helen.

QUESTION:  Does it matter if stools float?  Is that a good or bad <BR>
sign? Does it mean anything about the diet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ANSWER:I am an integral health educator (with UC) specializing in <BR>
whole foods nutrition. From my experience personally and with clients, <BR>
stools GENERALLY float when a more alkalizing diet has been consumed. <BR>
Alkalizing foods include vegetables, fruit and some dairy. Maintaining <BR>
a slightly alkalizing diet is important to intestinal health. People <BR>
also report floating stools after using acidophilus implants <BR>
repeatedly and when using intestinal bulking agents (eg.psyllium <BR>
husks). I think floating stools are a good thing and I take it as a <BR>
sign that the intestinal environment is becoming more friendly.<BR>
<BR>
This is just my personal experience.<BR>
