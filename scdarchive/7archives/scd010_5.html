<B>Food analysis</B>  <BR>

<BR>
Hello everyone:<BR>
 I don't know if anyone  else will be interested in this, but I dug up this info on the Web.  The US Department of Agriculture has a massive web site at which you can search for the nutritional content of thousands of things.  So, I looked up a bunch of vegetables and fruits, and found out their carbohydrate and fiber content.  I still can't find information anywhere about the specific sugars in foods, but this is a start:<BR>
<BR>

First, here are the vegetables we are supposed to avoid (***all of the items I list below are for 100 grams, boiled, unless otherwise stated***)<BR>
<BR>

Potato:  86 Kilocalories; 20 g carbos; 1.8 g Fiber Parsnip:  81 Kilocalories; 19.53 g. carbos; 4 g. 
<BR>
Fiber Sweet Potato:  105 Kc; 24.28 g. Carbos; 1.8 g. Fiber<BR>
<BR>

Here are the veggies we are supposed to introduce first:<BR>
<BR>

Zucchini:  16 Kc; 3.93 g. Carbos; 1.4 g. <BR>
Fiber Pumpkin:  20 Kc; 4.9 Carbos; 1.1 Fiber <BR>
Tomato:  27 Kc; 5.83 Carbos; 1 Fiber <BR>
Carrot:  45 Kc; 10.48 Carbos; 3.3 Fiber <BR>
Green Beans:  35 Kc; 7.89 Carbos; 3.2 Fiber <BR>
Butternut Squash:  40 Kc; 10.49 Carbos; No Fiber<BR>
<BR>

Here are a few other veggies:    <BR>Cabbage:  22 Kc; 4.46 g. Carbos; 2.3 g. Fiber 
<BR>
Broccoli:  28 Kc; 5.06 Carbos; 2.9 g. Fiber <BR>
Spinach:  23 Kc; 3.75 Carbos; 2.4 Fiber <BR>
Red/Green Pepper:  28 Kc; 6.7 Carbos; 1.2 Fiber <BR>
Cauliflower:  23 Kc; 4.1 Carbos; 2.7 Fiber <BR>
Onion:  44 kc; 10.15 Carbos; 1.4 Fiber <BR>
Cucumber (RAW):  13 Kc; 2.76 Carbos; .8 Fiber<BR>
<BR>

 Here are a few fruits:<BR>
<BR>

Apple:  53 Kc; 13.64 Carbos; 2.4 Fiber <BR>
Pear (RAW):  59 Kc; 15.11 Carbos; 2.4 Fiber <BR>
Orange (RAW):  47 Kc; 11.75 Carbos; 2.4 Fiber <BR>
Banana (RAW):  92 Kc; 23.43 Carbos; 2.4 Fiber <BR>
Lemon Juice:  25 Kc; 8.63 Carbos; .4 Fiber<BR>
<BR>

 I think it is interesting that carrots and butternut squash are so high in carbos, relative to the other vegetables on the favored list. I personally think I have had a few problems with both of these. I also found green beans difficult to digest, as have others apparently. 
 The information here indicates that green beans and carrots have the  highest fiber content out of all of these vegetables (except  parsnips), and they aren't particularly low in carbos.<BR>
<BR>

I should say that I have leaky cut and severe candida (caused by 800  tablets of tetracycline four years ago), not IBD.  So, my needs might  be a bit different.  But if I were to choose vegetables from the info  on this list, I would pick zucchini, pumpkin, cucumber (peeled and  sauteed, not strange at all, even Julia Child has a recipe!), and  tomato to start.<BR>
<BR>

I hope I didn't bore people with this!  I like to know the reasons why things work, so I am trying to find as much info as I can.  If anyone else wants to hunt for themselves, the USDA location is:<BR>

<BR>
There is a site on the net that has been very helpful for me in determining
if a food is allowable in the SCD. It's called the Plant Tracker <A HREF=
"http://www.axis-net.com/pfaf/index.htm">http://www.axis-net.com/pfaf/index.htm</A>
and you can search a large data base that will give you details of the food's
make-up.<BR>
For example I wanted to know if Jicama would be ok on SCD. I searched Plant
Tracker and found that it's a source of starch. <BR>
Hope this helps. <BR>
God Bless you all!<BR>

The RDA for calcium for adults, 25 and older, is 800 milligrams per<BR>
day; for those 11-24, the RDA is 1200 milligrams of calcium.  United<BR>
States recommendations are more than 50% higher than the British<BR>
and Japanese.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Oxalic acid, which is found in spinach, rhubarb, chard, and<BR>
beet greens is often said to bind with calcium and reduce absorbtion.<BR>
In laboratory experiments, calcium does combine with oxalates. However,<BR>
at normal dietary intakes, oxalates have little practical effect on<BR>
calcium absorbtion (1).<BR>
