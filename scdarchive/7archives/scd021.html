I just had the results of a blood test back last week. The cholesterol 
levels were very good. Yet I eat at least two eggs each day and use butter 
on most all veggies. I dont believe it to be a problem on this diet.<BR>

&gt; I really suspect that suspect all the cholesterol is in the procesed foods<BR>

<BR>
High cholesterol levels aren't due to eating lots of cholesterol. They<BR>
are due to eating a high carb, low fat diet. <BR>
<BR>
At one time, I was eating a &quot;healthy&quot; breakfast of whole wheat pancakes<BR>
with maple syrup every day. My cholesterol level was around 205, not<BR>
especially bad. Then I switched to eggs every day for breakfast and quit<BR>
all grains. My next test showed that it had dropped to 180. Even with<BR>
2-3 eggs/day. But the reason for the drop was that I had stopped all the<BR>
grains and maple syrup. <BR>
<BR>
Linus Pauling in his book How to Live Longer and Feel Better quotes a<BR>
study done in 1964. 18 subjects were kept in a locked environment for 6<BR>
months while their diet was completely controlled. Their diet and<BR>
cholesterol levels can be summarized as:<BR>
<BR>
  ordinary food     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        227<BR>
  glucose as only carb    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   173 after 2 weeks, 160 after 4 weeks<BR>
  25% sucrose, 75% glucose &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  up to 178 after 1 week, 208 after 2 more 
weeks<BR>
  back to 100% glucose     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  175 after a week, continued to drop to 150<BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
See pages 42-43 of his book.<BR>
<BR>
A great explanation of why the SCD works to improve our health and<BR>
normalize weight can be found in the book: <BR>
<BR>
   The Schwarzbein Principle<BR>
   The Truth About Aging, Health and Weight Loss<BR>
   by Diana Schwarzbein, M.D., and Nancy Deville<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Schwarzbein is an endicronologist and got into this through working<BR>
with diabetic patients. To greatly simplify what she has found, eat lots<BR>
of protein and fat, and be wary of carbs. See<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.sboutdoors.com/health/index.html">
http://www.sboutdoors.com/health/index.html</A> for the book's preface and<BR>
how you can order the book. She also has cookbooks that are very good<BR>
with many of the recipes SCD safe, or can be easily modified to be.<BR>
<BR>
To quote her:<BR>
<BR>
  &quot;To be absorbed, carbohydrates need to be digested, in the small<BR>
intestine, into simple sugars. If you overeat carbohydrates some of them<BR>
will escape being digested into simple sugars and will continue on into<BR>
the large intestine. Once carbohydrates enter the large intestine, the<BR>
bacteria there will break down all the sugar into gas, which causes<BR>
distention and pain. To make you feel worse, water is pulled from the<BR>
bloodstream into the colon to respond to the large sugar load that<BR>
should not be there, resulting in loose stool.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Elaine has said that we should be eating more fat, but that due to the<BR>
anti-fat hysteria, she was afraid to put that into her book. So she left<BR>
it for us to read between the lines. Dr. Schwarzbein has no fear of<BR>
repeatedly saying that lots of fat and low carbs is the way to go. And<BR>
she backs it up with lots of references to medical studies (109<BR>
references total).<BR>
<BR>
We've had polls looking for a common factor amongst us (such as<BR>
fillings). Here's another:<BR>
<BR>
How many have a history of eating a high carb, low fat diet? I know I<BR>
certainly did. Even as a small child, I remember being very careful to<BR>
remove even the smallest bits of fat from meat. And I lived on bowls of<BR>
cereal piled high with sugar.<BR>

<B>High cholesterol </B> <BR>

Thu, 20 Mar 1997 21:50:25 GMT<BR><BR>

Dear Micheal and Denise,<BR><BR>

I too was worried about high cholesterol levels, in fact my GP was very 
disturbed when I told him I eat a dozen eggs a week along with a fairly 
high meat intake.  He insisted on cholesterol tests.  The results:  lower 
cholesterol than average.  At that time I'd been on the diet 9 months. 
I 
think part of the reason for favourable results are the high intake of nuts 
and fish.  The fats in these actually help your body deal with undesirable 
fats.  My advice, if you're concerned, is to have a cholesterol test done 
at about 6 months into the diet.  (Apparently it can take a number of 
months for diet to have a measurable effect on cholesterol levels.)<BR><BR>

Good health<BR><BR>

Concerning the high cholesterol, I too eat about 12 eggs per week, lots
of 
nuts, and very high fat yogurt, the 18% kind.  I also put a lot of 
mayonnaise on things, my homemade kind.  I use it to make sauces for 
vegetables and also with Tuna.  Lots of cheese too, and olives.  My 
cholesterol tested a few months ago at excellent levels.  I have been on
the 
diet (as best I can) for a year.  Even though the diet is &quot;high fat&quot;,
I 
struggle to keep the weight on and have to double up sometimes on the nuts 
and yogurt.  Ironic for someone who used to fight the battle of the bulge. 
The weight loss is purely a part of the diet result of the diet as I am 
currently in good health and not losing weight from being sick.  <BR><BR>

          I had the same concern regarding the fat content of the 
          diet.  I wasn't concerned about gaining weight because, like 
          so many others on the diet, I was on the low end of the 
          weight scale.  After almost a year on the diet, I have 
          gained a little weight (which I attribute to being able to 
          absorb nutrients more efficiently).  I want to maintain this 
          weight and not have quite so much fat in my diet so I do 
          things like use only egg whites, use 1% milk for yogurt, 
          watch my intake of cheese, and eat lots of fruit and 
          vegetables.  At the start of the diet, I was eating more 
          meat, but not many nuts because I thought they would be 
          hard to digest.  Now I can tolerate them better and eat 
          more nuts and less meat.  Nothing drastic, just moderation.<BR><BR>

<B>cholesterol and prednisone</B> <BR>

 Sat, 22 Mar 1997 17:15:03 GMT'<BR><BR>

As for cholesterol and the diet.  Well, the diet may be higher in saturated 
fat than most people were used to eating, but there are also things about 
the diet that can lower your cholesterol.  For example, a high fiber diet 
has be linked to lower cholesterol levels, and if you are at the point in 
the diet where you can eat raw fruits and vegetables, than you are probably 
getting a lot of fiber.  Also, I think someone else mentioned this, but
the 
fat in nuts can actually lower your cholesterol.  And finally exercising
can 
lower your bad cholesterol levels and raise the good.  I know for myself 
that my diet has improved my health so much that now I can exercise quite 
regularly compared to pre-diet days. 
Another interested point about cholesterol and heart disease is a study
that 
found a link between a bacteria present in the lining of the arteries and 
plaque formation.  I can't remember who did the study, although I could 
probably find the reference if anyone is interested.  But I think that what 
they were saying was that it wasn't just diet that was involved, but this 
bacteria has to be present as well. 
I also have a question about prednisone, that is a little off topic.  My 
sister has been taking medication to treat acne and it has turned her skin 
red and blotchy.  On Friday she went to the dermatologist and he gave her
a 
shot of prednisone.  This seems a bit drastic to me considering all I've 
heard about prednisone from this list, I've never taken it myself.  I guess 
I'm just wondering if I should be concerned and if she should ask her doctor 
for a different way to treat the redness.  Thanks.<BR><BR>

Take care, <BR>

<B>Cholesteral and digestion</B> <BR>

 Sat, 22 Mar 1997 21:07:58 GMT<BR><BR>

This talk of cholesteral has promted me to write about something I read
about in 
the Economist.  It was about a study published in Lancet that explored the 
relationship between cholesteral and nerve development.  Anyway, it had 
mentioned that cholestral seemed to work along with digestive enzymes to
to help 
break down food.  Since this diet is so high in cholesteral, maybe that
is what 
is helping us.  Any thoughts?<BR><BR>

Hi All !<BR><BR>

Thanks to all involved in keeping the lines of communication open the last
bit.<BR><BR>

Question: Has anyone had increased staining and build up on teeth? Melissa 
recently went for her dental app. and our dentist(new to us as our other
one 
retired) was concerned about the exceptional staining &amp; buildup for
her age. 
She wondered if the diet,in combination with the UC   &amp; meds caused
it. 
She's going to moniter her to see how quickly it recurs.<BR><BR>

  
Melissa is past one year on the diet and still doing wonderful. In fact,
she 
has gained back the 15 lbs lost last year while  keeping a hectic basketball 
schedule. She's down to 2.5 mgs. prednisone on alternate days and next week 
goes to 2.5 every 3rd day.<BR><BR>

I shudder to think where she'd be without the diet!<BR><BR>

Anyone else with similar dental problem?<BR><BR>

Also re fats- My cousin, a dietician, found the diet okay-with  vit B 
supplement. She said the egg concern was somewhat overrated and that 
moderation for any food was important.  Every body reacts somewhat 
differently. <BR><BR>

A good day to all- Cathy<BR><BR>

Cathy, <BR>

I have experienced an increase in tooth sensitivity.  My dentist said 
that the acids in fruit juice and yogurt are the cause.  He suggests 
brushing right after consuming anything acidic or if this is not 
possible, to swish around some water and spit it out, pitu!  I don't 
know about the buildup though.  <BR>

<B>stained teeth</B> <BR>

 Sat, 22 Mar 1997 19:11:03 GMT<BR><BR>

Dear Cathy,<BR><BR>

Since being on the diet ( a year and a half now)  I have noticed 
significantly more staining on my teeth.  My last dental visit took ages
as 
the dentist attempted to clean things up.  The staining is mostly on the 
inside of my front teeth.  Now I brush most times after I eat although not 
always with toothpaste.  The situation is a little better but the build
up 
is beginning again and seems to resist my efforts to remove it.  I do drink 
tea, about 3 cups a day as I did pre diet.  But now I put in honey and I 
noticed that it turns the tea black.  Perhaps, for me, this is the cause 
but I've also wondered if the honey alone would cause the staining.<BR><BR>

Good health<BR><BR>

Re: teeth</B><BR><BR>

Very interesting, I too started having tooth sensitivity.  Mine started 
when I started the diet and lasted two weeks (I am into my third week 
now) where even drinking water at room temperature bothered them. Now it 
has abated.  I wasn't sure how it was related, but after reading your 
letter, thought about it again.  Has yours been going on for a long 
time?  My only guess was that somehow it was related to killing off the 
bacteria -- don't ask me how:), I feel like I've had some pretty strange 
symptoms since trying the diet and can only surmise that they are 
related to die-off plus maybe metabolic changes.  But my teeth were not 
sensitive at all before starting the diet.   <BR>
<BR>

Denise: <BR>

I've been on the diet for 8 months now and the tooth sensitivity began 
on month number 3.  Of course I ignored it until just about one month 
ago.  My pre-SCD days were shamefully devoid of fruits and vegetables. 
Now they make up a large part of my diet but I do lean more heavily 
toward the fruits.  And I drink a large glass of freshly squeezed orange 
juice every day and lots of yogurt and I never was real good about 
breaking my neck to brush my teeth immediately afterward.  I do now and 
they are better.  My dentist also gave me free samples of sensodyne 
toothpaste and a flouride rinse.  These have helped considerably.  You 
know, you probably should make that ever-so-enjoyable trip to the 
dentist just in case there is something drastically wrong.  Don't wait 5 
months like I did.

About dental visits. Before starting the SCD I read somewhere that the<BR>
synthetic abrasives in a lot of commercial toothpast may at least be<BR>
linked to intestinal aggrevation. So, it could be that someone swallowed<BR>
some mechanical irritants at the dentists office. Sugar would also be a<BR>

May I suggest Tom's of Maine toothpaste, takes some getting used to, but<BR>

<BR>
From a personel standpoint, the only correlation I've seen between dental<BR>
treatment and flares is that when I am in a flare, my gums are swollen &amp;<BR>
bloody. When I am in remission, my gums are healthy. I've worked in dental<BR>
offices for over 20 years, have known patients with UC &amp; with crohns, and<BR>
all of their experiences are in line with my own. As an aside, I have found<BR>
that most patients with any of the auto immune diseases share this<BR>
experience. Most of these diseases have, as a symptom, inflamation (bowel,<BR>
joints, skin), which seems to go hand in hand with the theory that when the<BR>
disease is active, the accompanying inflamation would affect the gums as<BR>
well. As for cancelling your son's dental appointment, it is my opinion<BR>
that because of his disease (not in spite of it) and the various<BR>
medications that become neccessary,  regular dental checkups &amp; cleanings<BR>
become more, not less important.<BR>

<BR>Lori,
<BR>The diet itself does not cause any tooth discoloration, the grape juice is
 definately the culprit. It happened to me. The only thing to do is try to
 brush after drinking grape juice. It is better to water the juice down as
 well (1/2 juice, 1/2 water). It is not permanent discoloration, don't
 worry. It is just like tea or coffee stains; brushing more helps (try
 baking soda), and ultimately your hygienist can remove the grayness.

 Sun, 23 Mar 1997  5:48:55 GMT<BR><BR>

To all my crohnies:  <BR><BR>

	Thank you all for being here.  I've been alone with both Crohns and 
Ulcerative Colitis for 12 years now, but luckily mostly functional.  <BR><BR>

	I've been on the diet for 5 weeks now and it is already helping.  I did 
the Dr. Atkins diet for a year and half before but he doesn't allow fruit
and 
his purpose, after all, is to lose weight.  Besides, I cheated so much with 
chocolate and milk it didn't help much.  <BR><BR>

	As for cholesterol, here are my personal, unscientific observations: 
some people's bodies just produce too much cholesterol no matter what they
eat. 
They will not be able to do this.  Other people just thrive on vegetables
and 
pasta.  They know who they are.  We know too.  We tend to like meat, dairy 
products etc. and don't have naturally high cholesterol.  I get a blood
test 
every month (my cholesterol is less than 190 and all I eat right now is
meat, 
eggs, cheese and butter).  I have vitamin and hormone levels checked as
well as 
the usual cholesterol, CBC and liver enzymes.  Also, it is true that nuts
help, 
not hurt.  I can't wait til I can eat some.  <BR><BR>

	As for teeth, mine began to be very sensitive about three years ago.  I 
thought it was that I had turned 40 and we all know whatever warranty we
have 
expires just after your 40th birthday.  But, perhaps it is the bacteria
or the 
diet.  Anyway, there are a lot of things you have no choice but to do with
your 
teeth after you turn 40 if you aren't already.  In addition to flossing,
if you 
are eating a lot of meat you must use a &quot;water pik&quot; or you will
never get all 
the bits.  Add some listerine (yech, I use a generic but it has sorbitol)
to the 
water to kill the bacteria.  Finally, the trick to the sensitivity is to
rub gel 
flouride on your teeth every night just before you go to bed.  It is now 
&quot;over-the-counter&quot; but very expensive.  Perhaps the flouride rinses
work just as 
well.  <BR><BR>

	For whatever it is worth, my dental visits are better now than ever, even 
though I drink a lot of herbal tea and smoke incessantly.  <BR><BR>

	Again, thanks for being there.  I'm enjoying the comaraderie enormously.<BR><BR>

&gt; or maintain an acceptable weight on the SCD diet (even when eating
lots of<BR>
&gt; nuts)? Does weight tend to go up or down and then stabilize? Does appetite<BR>
&gt; change with time?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Animal fat and cholesterol aside, is there any reason to limit fat
from foods<BR>
&gt; like nuts, avocados, and olive oil?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Are there foods on the diet that are more filling than others?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I almost don't care about how much I weigh (I don't own a scale), but
I want<BR>
&gt; my weight to be stable, so I can invest in a professional wardrobe
that will<BR>
&gt; fit for a long time. I now have size 2 clothes that fit perfectly on
good<BR>
&gt; days, and size 8 clothes that I can't button when I have IBS and am
bloated!<BR>

Dear Jennifer,<BR><BR>
In the beginning I went through a phase where I too felt ravenous. I 
was eating huge quantities of food and highly caloric ones as well.  
Sometimes I felt like I just couldn't get enough. A couple of things 
helped me. I think one is time, but also I noticed that my appetite 
lessened and I suddenly felt less hungry when I started taking psyllium 
husks (for me, 1/4 tsp twice a day in water, some people take more, like 
one tsp. twice a day or more). I feel this helped lubricate my gut 
somehow in a good way and helped me get more nutrition out of my food.  
I also started taking EPA (fish oil) supplements around the same time, 
which may also have helped by reducing some inflamation. But I heard 
something recently, in a medical journal which really caught my eye; the 
article (in this month's Townsend Newsletter for Doctors and Patients),I 
read a viewpoint that when we initially begin heal ourselves after a 
wasting, degenerative disease, in the beginning the cells are replacing 
themselves so quickly as they are given the chance to heal, that there 
is like double turnover than usual. Usually during this phase, people 
feel raveously hungry. According to the article this is a phase that 
passes as healing continues. The rate of turnover of the cells slows 
down. Somehow, that made sense to me.<BR><BR>

I just want to say, that I did lose weight, but it never went below a 
certain point and now gradually it has come up to where I was when I 
started the diet. I'm sure other's might have some more tips for how to 
keep the weight on. It sounds like the diet was really helping you.  
For me it has been so worth it. Sure is nerve-wracking trying to figure 
out the ins and outs though. This group is such valuable support to me 
in that regard! I wish you the best.<BR><BR>

<B>Re: Gottschall Diet, fat and hunger</B> <BR>

Sat, 17 May 1997 12:36:20 GMT<BR><BR>

Jennifer:<BR><BR>

I have been on the diet since January 7--a little over 4 months--and have 
lost about 33 pounds. During that time I can honestly say I have not been 
hungry. I am 6' 1&quot; and now weigh 221 pounds so I need to eat alot of
nuts, 
muffins, meat, yogurt, and vegetables to keep my energy level up. My 
weight started to drop immediately and dramatically the first few weeks. 
It has slowly tapered off at my current weight. Although I continue to 
VERY slowly lose weight (perhaps 3-4 pounds in the last six weeks), it 
seems to be stabilizing.<BR><BR>

The hunger issue is quite perplexing to me. I am a person who formally ate 
&quot;mass quantities&quot; of the worst kinds of food--pasta, mashed potatoes, 
french fries, pizza, cheese steaks, donuts, etc. Since being on this diet, 
my appetite has diminshed significantly. I try to eat a variety of what's 
allowed on the diet so as to not die of boredom, but I also do not deprive 
myself of anything allowed. I think the trick is to eat until satisfied
so  you are not tempted to stray.<BR><BR>

I follow Elaine's admonition to FANATICALLY ADHERE to the diet and ingest 
absolutely NOTHING that isn't &quot;approved.&quot; From the very first
week my 
symptoms showed dramatic improvement. Now, four months later, I have 
virtually NO symptoms remaining--I feel more &quot;normal&quot; than I have
in years. <BR><BR>

I had a colonoscopy last week and was told by the doctor that my ulcerative 
colitis is now limited to the left side and is &quot;very, very mild.&quot; 
Considering that I have been hospitalized with this damned affliction three 
times in the past few years, I was absolutely elated! I have every 
confidence that the diet is clearly up the colitis and that my next 
colonoscopy will show no signs of it!!!<BR><BR>

If you showed improvement on the diet and felt better after two weeks, keep 
at it. Although your doctor recommended the book, he clearly hasn't read 
it. Recommending you eat potatoes, oatmeal, and soy milk is bad advice on 
this diet--one cannot cheat AT ALL for this to work properly. Bake lots
of  muffins, prepare big batches of allowable foods and freeze them for later 
meals. I find the hardest time is when my schedule gets really hectic. If 
I have nothing prepared or frozen, it takes a great deal of will power to 
stay true to the diet.<BR><BR>

Another added benefit is that my cholesterol level has actually gone down 
on the diet (although it was always under 200 anyway). <BR><BR>

Good luck!<BR><BR>

Dear Jennifer, <BR>

My daughter, Melissa-now 16- has been following the diet rigidly for 
the past 17 months. She is a very active teen- played soccer last fall and 
basketball all winter. She just recently was weaned off prednisone and is 
now medication free. 
She had lost close to 20 lbs. a year and a half ago so I was quite 
concerned about the diet's caloric intake. Yes she would get very hungry 
the first few months-sometimes a real weakness- she still occasionally has 
these episodes. Having snacks of fruit readily available,good portions of 
meat and vegetables at meals- a favorite is broccoli with melted cheddar 
cheese- are important to her. Each day she also has a large yogurt shake 
with blueberries and honey mixed in- which I believe gives her that extra 
caloric boost. <BR>

The past fall seemed to be a real turning point for her as she 
slowly started gaing somme weight back - she is now at a great weght for
her 
heighth and doing very well. I notced that this weight gain also coincided 
with a return to one solid mov't a day- prior to that this was off and on. 
Perhaps healthy food assimilation was happening for her. 
Hope this helps with your situation.<BR>

Dear Arlene,<BR>

I had my cholesterol checked after six months on the diet it was 
not at all high. I only recall one person on the list that had high and
he 
might have had it before the diet. Mine is in the ideal range so if I were 
you I would just have it checked after six months or so and then recheck 
again in six months. Hopefully you know what it was pre - diet .  
Also to the person who asked about increased appetite mine 
increased at the beginning of the diet I was really packing away the steak 
and prime rib but then my appetite subsided. I also lost a lot of weight 
but I was happy as I have Behcet's and my weight had ballooned since I 
became ill four years ago. (Pred) I am very happy to be back to a size 8.
<BR><BR>

I have been on the diet around 8 months now and do not seem to be losing 
any more which makes me happy as I don't want to. The last two weeks my 
colon has been a little bit upset but I think it is only a minor setback.
<BR><BR>

I know I will never eat yeast again.<BR>

Happy weekend,<BR><BR>

<B>Re: cholesterol worries</B><BR>

Sat, 17 May 1997 6:13:35 GMT<BR><BR>

It may be surprising to hear this but there is a good bit of evidence that 
dietary fat does -not- cause most people to get bad cholesterol, and in 
fact there is a good bit of evidence that diets -low- in fat cause problems 
with bad cholesterol and triglycerides. There have also been very recent 
studies showing low-fat diets to cause both heart disease and breast cancer 
in women. I myself had my cholesterol massively improved by slashing my 
carbohydrate intake and increasing my fat and protein intake.<BR><BR>

I have a pile of scientific references I can send to anyone who is 
interested in this subject; I won't clutter up the list with them. But in 
general all you really need to do if you're worried about this is, go get 
your cholesterol checked before you start the diet, and then get it checked 
after a couple of months on the diet. If it's gotten significantly worse, 
then consider your options. If it's gotten better or is just fine (which
is 
the most likely occurrence) then you have no worries.<BR><BR>

Also, even if it does worsen (which I would bet you a shiny new nickle it 
would not), unless you've already got other health risks for heart disease, 
having bad cholesterol for a few months is not going to kill you. What you 
would have to consider was how long you wanted to put up with it. If the 
diet really causes you a cholesterol problem, then leaving the diet later 
should fix the problem.<BR><BR>

&gt;I'm about to embark on the diet, but I have some concerns about it as a<BR>

&gt;long-term (more than a couple of months) eating plan.<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;My cholesterol tends to get high, but I can control it through diet, namely a<BR>

&gt;If I keep my fat intake to<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;Elaine's diet seems to be -- or could be, I guess is more accurate -- fairly<BR>

&gt;high in saturated fats (animal fats), and cholesterol.  There's a lot of eggs<BR>

&gt;and cheese involved, not to mention meats.  This makes it pretty hard to<BR>

&gt;regulate your cholesterol.<BR><BR></FONT>

If you've been following the Paleodiet list-group, as well as read the Lutz 
book excerpt, you will find that (like virtually all of western people) 
you've been fully indoctrinated with the &quot;party line&quot; about fats.<BR><BR>

It's now becoming clearer &amp; clearer (read Barry Sears' book &quot;The Zone&quot; for 
a starter, or Lutz's excerpt, escpecially his section &quot;Fat is Not The 
Culprit&quot;) that this fear of fat and supposed health benefits by its 
avoidance is total bullshit, let me repeat, bullshit, foisted on us on the 
industrial food-processing industries starting in the 50's.<BR><BR>

Do some reading, convince yourself, then don't worry about it &amp; just eat 
more &quot;good&quot; fats (i.e. lard or rancid beef fat are NOT a good fat, but I'd 
say olive oil, chicken / duck fat, butter, full-fat yoghurt, fish oils, 
,avocado probably are).<BR><BR>

&gt;She says it's possible to be a vegetarian on her<BR>

&gt;legumes (the only vegetable proteins that seem to be allowed).  I'm not a<BR>

&gt;vegetarian, particularly, but I've found eating a near-vegetarian diet to<BR>

&gt;be an<BR>

&gt;excellent means of keeping my saturated fats low while getting enough<BR>

protein.<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;Any thoughts on this problem?  I'm 54 years old, and while IBD (they're<BR>

&gt;not sure<BR>

&gt;if it's UC or Crohn's colitis) is certainly a major health issue, it probably<BR>

&gt;won't kill me -- and a heart attack very well might.<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;Then there's the colon cancer problem, important generally but especially<BR>

&gt;so for<BR>

&gt;those of us with colitis.  It's known that a low-fat high-fiber (whole grains<BR>

&gt;again) diet lowers the risk factors for colon cancer.  It would seem that<BR>

&gt;Elaine's diet would be higher risk in this regard.<BR>

 Sat,  5 Jul 1997  2:43:49 GMT<BR><BR>

John,<BR>

I agree about the fact that we don't know the whole story on fat and 
cholesterol.  I also heard on the news the other day that aside from 
advoiding animal fats, people who want to keep their cholesterol levels 
under control should avoid sugar as well.<BR>

I think the key is that it's really only animal fats that have been 
linked to higher cholesterol levels.  So you should not be worried about 
eating the other fats, like olive oil and the fats in nuts and fish. 
And depending on your diet before, you may actually end up eating lower 
fat content overall.  A lot of the foods that we have to avoid because 
of their sugar or starch content, also have a lot of fat in them, like 
donuts, cakes and chocolate bars.<BR>

As far as fiber goes, the diet is high in fiber once diarrhea is no 
longer a problem and you can start introducing raw fruits and 
vegetables, nuts and beans.  And I'm pretty sure that oat bran is not 
the only soluble fiber that has been linked to lowering cholesterol. 
Another source of soluble fiber is the part of a fruit other than it's 
skin.<BR>

Also, exercise is a very successful way of controlling your cholesterol 
level, as well as many other health benefits. 
By the way, there were a few people on the diet who posted their pre and 
post diet cholesterol levels and they had actually dropped.<BR><BR>

 
Take care,<BR>

&gt;Hi people:<BR>

&gt;<BR>

&gt;I am new to the list and have been reading your correspondence with great<BR>
&gt;interest. I have an undiagnosed digestive problem which has responded<BR>
&gt;well to the scd. I came to the diet naturally, simply by eliminating<BR>
&gt;things which bothered me. By &quot;bothered&quot; I mean they caused extreme<BR>
&gt;fatigue and an unusual cardiac response. At first I would awaken at night<BR>
&gt;after a few minutes of sleep with my heart racing, later on the rapid<BR>
&gt;heart beat would occur anytime I ate certain complex carbs. I eliminated<BR>
&gt;all grains and dairy, except for cheese and certain other vegies. I had<BR>
&gt;diarrhea only when I consumed dairy products. My other main symptom is<BR>
&gt;dehydration which, I have discovered, was partly responsible for the fatigue.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I like the scd, I feel alive when I follow it faithfully and do no<BR>
&gt;physical work. However, I live on a small homestead and there is alot of<BR>
&gt;physical labour involved in this lifestyle, and the scd just can't<BR>
&gt;generate the amount of energy I need. I was ok until I foolishly<BR>
&gt;submitted to a lactose intolerance test. The results did not show a<BR>
&gt;classic intolerance, but I haven't been able to eat cheese since - which<BR>
&gt;was, I guess, my major source of fuel (I ate gobs of it everyday when<BR>
&gt;active). So now, when I attempt to put in even a half day of work, I get<BR>
&gt;so played out that I can't move for a couple of days.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have had no results from the medical profession and am floundering for<BR>

&gt;the diet in its early stages. Any help will be greatly appreciated.<BR>

<BR><BR>

Hi, Penny:<BR><BR>

Like you, I also would like to eat cheese as Elaine says, but it just 
doesn't work for me.<BR><BR>

About 2 weeks ago I &quot;went back to square one&quot; and studied the entire 
digestive system in all my physiology books (I'm a medical massage 
therapist) because the SCD dietdidn't seem to click 100% for me; from that, 
I decided to increase my fat intake (good fats, if you know what that 
means) and things are working better now ... still not perfect, so I don't 
know what still needs to be &quot;jiggled&quot;, but not bad.<BR><BR>

I talked with Elaine on the phone this week, and asked her about my 
conclusions that I needed to increase fats; she replied that people should 
be smart enough to figure this out themselves by reading the book, that the 
needed calories obviously had to come from somewhere, and that the reason 
she didn't explicitly state in the books that fat intake needs to increase 
is that she doesn't want to get sued for telling people to increse fats 
beccause of all the hype / propaganda about &quot;cholesterol&quot;, so she figured 
readers could &quot;read between the lines&quot; and figure it out.<BR><BR>

Personally, I was NOT able to do this from the book, only after (as 
mentioned) by going back to square one &amp; my own medical books and thinking 
things through.<BR><BR>

But anyway, bottom line advice therefore: eat more &quot;good&quot; fats, and you'll 
probably find that you or any IBD'er tolerates fats quite well.<BR><BR>

                Sincerely,<BR><BR>

I totally agree with Dietmar's excellent post in response to John's valid 
concern.  We have been brainwashed in this society.  The industries do it quite 
easily, and the mainstream medical industries fall for it too.  Especially the 
Dieticians, whose schooling in my opinion is major brainwashing (sorry to 
offend anyone out there who is one).  The things most MDs and Dieticians 
believe in are pounded it into their heads for years during the training.  Then 
they become so closed minded, it's almost impossible to convince them of 
anything else.  Tell any Dietician about our SCD and they'll tell you it's just 
plain wrong.  They don't want to hear an explanation or believe in anyone's 
testimonial experience, because that is the extent of their brainwashing, so to 
speak.<BR><BR>

I just saw another exposee that told how they actually have no scientific 
evidence that salt is bad for high blood pressure and heart disease.  Ask 
anyone you know and they'll tell you that too much salt is bad for you. 
Apparently there is no real proof of this.  They actually have studies proving 
the opposite, that there's nothing really wrong with salt, and this idea of the 
badness of salt started in the 50's with a theory, a rumor and it stuck.  The 
media is to blame for all this misinformation as well.  Think about how many 
things in the past have been so publicized and thought to be true by the mass 
population, and then later on were disproved and are now regarded as total 
bunk.  An old saying goes that many of these ideas we think are &quot;the way it 
is&quot;, will one day be accepted to be &quot;as old as sealing wax&quot;. (I think that 
refers to the wax people used to use to seal letters, correct me if I'm wrong) 
meaning that at one time in history, everyone did it and thought it was normal, 
but now nobody does it anymore and wouldn't even consider it.<BR><BR>

Anyway, the point is, I think Dietmar was on the ball with his bit of advice. 
If I were concerned about cholesterol (rightfully so, with all the media about 
it), I would take a cholesterol test now, before starting the diet, get a 
baseline reading, and then go on the diet for a month.  Eat more fish and 
poultry, less red meat; more egg whites, less yolks; more olive oil, less 
butter, and more nuts, fruits, and vegies.  Notice I said &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot;, 
not &quot;all&quot; or &quot;none&quot;.  There's nothing wrong with a little butter, but that 
doesn't mean you can slather it on like there's no tomorrow.<BR><BR>

Another thing I remembered is the butter/margerine thing.  Remember how it was 
thought that margerine was healthier than butter.  Everyone was convinced. 
Nobody would dare say they thought butter was ok.  But NOW, it has been proven 
that margerine is actually WAY WORSE for everyone than even butter!  Ever hear 
about Trans-fatty acids, hydrogenation, etc? Did you know that there are 
actually regulations or laws now that prevent margerine advertisments from 
claiming margerine is good for your health?  It's all because they proved that 
margerine is horrible for you!  Thank God margerine is not allowed on this 
diet.  Although, I stopped eating margerine way before I found this diet. 
Margerine was only invented during the war because there wasn't enough butter 
to go around.  I'm too young to remember, but remember when you had to squeeze 
the food coloring in and mix it up yourself?  Gross!  When the war ended there 
was no reason to keep eating margerine, but the companies needed to keep making 
money so it became the &quot;healthier&quot; counterpart to butter.  Now we all know 
different, don't we.  Not to mention that margerine is an oil usually stored in 
plastic (for those of you who read my plastic ramblings earlier).  Margerine is 
probably worse than eating plastic.<BR><BR>

Ok, you're starting to think I'm nuts again, so I better go.  That'll be all 
for now.  Sorry to be so long. <BR>

I agree with the need to follow the diet 100%!  It's absolutely
crucial.  From personal experience, I know.  I've had two major
&quot;cheats,&quot; once for a frozen yogurt, the other time visiting San
Francicso an falling prey to some delicious french bread.  I suffered
for a week afterwards!  However, psychologically, both cheats were worth
it.  Guess I just had to see what would happen.  Minor character defect
of mine.  :)
<BR><BR>

As for weight gain and hunger -- I have definitely increased my fat
intake (the good kind as well as the bad).  Cashews have been a godsend
for me at times.  Also, chicken WITH skin.  And avocados.  I went
through phases when it felt like it was really hard to get enough to
eat.  I feel like there must be some phase in the diet when we can eat
without diahhrea but still can't quite absorb all the calories from our
food.  I was soooo hungry there for awhile, around month two.  I also
got low blood sugar shakies.  Now I don't experience either the hunger
or the low blood sugar problem.<BR><BR>


Best regards,<BR>

I'm still lurking on the sidelines.  I'm targeting starting the diet in mid
August.  Has anyone found that they gain unwanted weight on the diet?  It
seems like a lot of calories.  What I've heard is that people's weight
normalizes--they gain if they need it and lose if they need that--but
honestly I have trouble reasoning through that.  When I first looked at it I
thought the diet would put the body into a state of keytosis--burning body
fat--but if that were the case wouldn't everyone lose weight on the diet?  I
know it's supposed to improve absorption--which would allow one to fully
benefit from the calories eaten--and that aspect would make me think people
would gain weight.
<BR><BR>

So....those few crohnies who are actually overweight...what affect did the
SCD have on your weight?
<BR><BR>

I'm really not as skeptical as this may sound, I just don't get it.  And it
would be worth it to me if it made me feel better--even if I gained weight.
 It's more like I want to know what to expect.

Dear Ellen,<BR>

           That is the great thing about the diet it seems to set you to
your ideal weight , if you need to lose you lose, need to gain you gain. I
was a loser of 60lbs that I had gained from a stint on steroids. The weight
never came off until I went on the SCD and it stopped coming off just as I
hit my old normal weight. In the beginning I ate like a maniac and the more
I ate the more I lost . Now my appetite is on the small side and I have
stayed at the same weight for the last 4 months. I started the diet last
Oct. Good luck and don't be afraid to eat to your hearts content.<BR><BR>

I lost a little weight on the diet, but it stabilized.  My husband, on
the other had, who is also following the diet, did have quite a pot
belly that he had tried to lose for years through sensible eating.  I at
more than he did, the poor man.  Since being on the SCD five months,
Brian is really looking slim (and healthy).  He says it feels good to be
able to eat as much as he wants to.  By the way, during my really hungry
phase, I always thought it was from ketosis and I worked real hard to
get extra allowed carbs.  But now I don't try so hard and I still don't
get those &quot;ketosis feelings.&quot;  <BR>

Dear Ellen,<BR>

I'm one of those with UC that is overweight. I lost about 30 lbs on the
diet. I'm still a little overweight but am very happy feeling good, and I'm
very active. I think that removing sugar and starch had a lot to do with my
weight loss. No ice cream, potatoes or bread by itself has to have an
effect. I think that even if going on the diet had put weight on me, the
remission of my symptoms would have been woth it. Good luck.<BR>

I want to echo Rachel's comments.  I too have UC, have been on the diet
since January 7 (FANATICALLY!!), no longer have ANY (count 'em--ZIP!)
symptoms.  One of the very pleasant side effects has been that I have lost
51 pounds and am now at the weight I was when I got married 25 years ago!
I feel great and look a lot slimmer!  My primary incentive for following
the diet is my own good health.  Weight loss has merely been a bonus.
Incidently, my cholosterol level has also declined!  What more could one
ask for????

About people losing weight on the SCD, if you're underweight, you will
probably gain, not lose.  Because finally you will be able to actually
absorb some of the food you're eating.  My weight dipped breifly the
first month, but then it stabilized back to where it was before, pretty
normal.<BR><BR>

Ellen,<BR>
I've always lost weight on the SCD and gained weight immediately when I went
back to a diet of carbos and sugars.  I wouldn't expect a dramatic weight gain
on the diet.  It probably depends what your pre-SCD diet was.  If you were
already a low fat, low calorie eater, than you may gain a bit, but overall, you
could stick with the same low fat principles as before if you wanted (ie. skim
milk yogurt, low fat cheeses, chicken without the skin, trimmed meats, lots of
vegies and fruits, etc.) so you really shouldn't gain for any reason.  The SCD
may not be low fat, but it is low sugar and low carb, so that makes up for it.
<BR><BR>
I just read an article that told how the &quot;good fats&quot; (Essential Fatty Acids,
Omega 3 and 6) like those in nuts fish and avacados, etc. actually help burn
fat by increasing the rate of metabolic reactions in the body and burning more
fat into carbon dioxide, water and energy (heat), which results in fat burn-off
and a loss of excess weight.  They say your EFA intake should be 12 - 15 % of
your total caloric intake to do this, and at a ratio of two (omega 3) to one
(omega 6).  The article went on to say how by eating these pure, unadulterated
fats and oils, your energy levels and stamina increase, which makes you feel
like being more physically active too.  I found I had more energy after a while
on the diet, and no longer craved the forbiddens as much.  I think I lost
excess weight because the SCD was much healthier than my pre-SCD diet, which
contained a lot of carbos and sugar and little vegies and fruits.  I suspect
this pre-scd diet is fairly common (unhealthy anyhow), and that's why most
people's weights normalize (up or down) when they go on the diet.  I know that
not everyone ate badly before the SCD, and that some people have gained weight
on it too, so this is just my opinion and experience.  Like I said before, it
depends alot on how you were eating before the SCD.<BR>

You know one of the really great things about the SCD ?<BR>
<BR>
I can eat as much as I want of things that are usually frowned apon 
(mayo, meat, butter(!), nuts, eggs.... I could go on !) and I'm STILL 
loosing weight.<BR>
<BR>
I've been over weight for years, but since I started the diet 3 months 
ago, I've lost 20 pounds. And I'm still loosing about 1 pound per 
fortnight. <BR>
<BR>
I just had a delicious tuna salad for lunch and now I'm going to eat two 
squares of banana cake with DCCC frosting for desert. Yum !<BR>
<BR>
In a couple of hours I'll probably be hungry again and have a handfull 
of cashews and 3 or 4 dates.<BR>

<P>Janice,
Here's a pertinent paragraph from the Margarine Hoax article about the
the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs (many colitis drugs fit this
category, like Asacol) making it difficult for utilize omega-6.
Ruth
<P><A HREF="http://www.peg.apc.org/%7enexus/margarine.html">THE MARGARINE HOAX</A>  <BR>
--Margarine, Fatty Acids and Your Health--<BR>
To maintain good health it is important that we have the correct intake
of omega fatty acids in our diets.   Hydrogenated fats like margarine
are non-foods with toxic effects and should be avoided at any cost.
<P><BR>
<B>EFA BALANCE AND OUR HEALTH</B><BR>
<P>The two groups of essential fatty acids&amp;emdash;omega-3 and
omega-6&amp;emdash;are named for their molecular configurations and where
the first &quot;unsaturated&quot; bond
occurs along the chain of carbon atoms.
<P>Omega-6 oils are found primarily in vegetables and seeds. They are
converted to the E1 prostaglandins (mentioned earlier) via several
chemical steps. Most people
take in enough of these fatty acids, but some have difficulty converting
them to the active prostaglandins. This blockage is commonly caused by
excess trans- fats,
anti-inflammatory medications like aspirin or Tylenol, or deficiencies
of vitamin B6 or magnesium. An insufficiency of omega-6 EFAs can result
in auto-immune
problems, breast pain and lumpiness, eczema, hyperactivity in children,
hypertension, inflammation and PMS. Supplementing with borage, evening
primrose or
black-currant seed oils will usually bypass the blocked step and provide
the necessary precursor to make the desired prostaglandins.
<P>Dr Siguel has found that the omega-3s are the more likely to be
deficient in our Western diets. Because of food processing and dietary
choices, the average Western
diet today contains only one-sixth the amount of omega-3 fatty acids
needed for healthy function&amp;emdash;compared to a healthy balance 100
years ago. Evidence
indicates that a deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with
arthritis and joint stiffness, irritable bowel syndrome, PMS, prostate
problems, various skin
disorders as well as depression, phobias and schizophrenia.
<P>The two main sources of omega-3s are oils from organic flax seeds and
from cold-water fish (such as mackerel, sardines, tuna, trout and
salmon). These fish should
not be fried because of the effect of the high temperatures involved and
the resultant free-radical damage. Unlike chicken and turkey, cold-water
fish should be eaten
with the skin on, as this is where the highest concentration of
desirable fats is located.
<P>There is some concern about eating fish frequently, due to the chemical
and heavy-metal pollution in the oceans. Predatory fish concentrate
these pollutants in their
fatty tissues, but deep-ocean fish are usually less tainted than coastal
species. Freshwater fish near agricultural, industrial or mining areas
are best avoided due to their
high-level intake of toxic chemicals. Farm-raised fish are fed something
akin to pet food and should be avoided; they are not as healthy and have
insignificant levels of
omega-3 fatty acids.
