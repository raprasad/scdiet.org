<BR>
Could you please tell me more about Elaine's diet because when I signed
up for this forum I asked Benito if he could tell me something about this
diet and I haven't heard anything.<BR>
<BR>
thanks<BR>

Hi Vicki,<BR>
<BR>
First of all, this is not a &quot;forum&quot; in the same sense as the CompuServe
forums.<BR>
It is an eMail support group. We are trying our best to get a proper listserver<BR>
going so that we don't have to CC everyone (which is what we are doing now)
and<BR>
only one address will need to be kept track of.<BR>
<BR>
Basically, &quot;Elaine's diet&quot; is the Specific Carb Diet. I'm on it
for my Crohn's<BR>
disease. I've been on it since October 1995 and at that time, I was seriously<BR>
ill. The doctor wanted to prescribe prednisone for me, but when I saw the
diet<BR>
being discussed in the Natural Medicine Forum of CompuServe, I asked the
doctor<BR>
to give me one month to try it before putting me on steroids (which I'm
very<BR>
afraid of, after hearing so many &quot;horror&quot; stories).<BR>
<BR>
The diet is outlined in the book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle, by Elaine<BR>
Gottschall. The intention of the diet is to exclude all foods that are not<BR>
monosaccharides, and therefore, help the digestive tract to heal. The foods
to<BR>
avoid are all grains (including corn and rice), all lactose (natural cheeses
and<BR>
homemade yogurt are okay, though, as the lactose is removed), all refined
sugar<BR>
(including corn syrup and molasses -- instead we use honey, fruit or saccharin<BR>
as sweeteners), and potatoes. (It's been so long since I've written a list
of<BR>
&quot;illegals&quot; that I may have missed something, sorry.)<BR>
<BR>
Since so many foods are outlawed, we are forced into being creative with
our<BR>
diets -- that's why having a support group is so valuable. Also, when we
feel<BR>
the urge to cheat, we have others to turn to and let us know that it just
isn't<BR>
worth it. The diet has to be followed 100% to be effective -- and if it
works<BR>
for you, you will know usually within a month. For me, I've avoided steroids,<BR>
gotten off azulfidine, avoided a second surgery and now have more energy
than I<BR>
had ever thought possible. The energy is the most amazing thing to me. Other<BR>
people in our group are more enthusiastic about no longer bleeding, no longer<BR>
being near a bathroom, etc, etc, but for me, I'm most excited that I now
have a<BR>
REAL life! I have never been as independent as I am now. My husband is away
to<BR>
Germany for six weeks (he's got four weeks left there) and I am coping like
a<BR>
normal person! I'm even letting my kids have sleepovers and we are going
places<BR>
and I'm not having to call social services for an aide! My kids are 7, 6
and 3<BR>
and are quite active, as you can imagine -- their friends seem even more
so,<BR>
maybe because they haven't been brought up having to respect a sick parent
as my<BR>
children have been. <BR>
<BR>
But, now, my kids also have the chance to be normal kids and not have to
fend<BR>
for themselves as much as they have had to in the past. . . sometimes I
thought<BR>
of myself as an alcoholic mother -- you know, the kind that you see on TV
with<BR>
the hangover and the kids are pouring their own cereal and getting dressed
on<BR>
their own while their mother is moaning and groaning in the background.
Except,<BR>
for me, I was groaning from the bathroom. They invariably got into an argument<BR>
when I was having bad diarrhea and unable to leave the toilet. I would weep
at<BR>
how helpless I was as a parent. It was very depressing.<BR>
<BR>
I don't know what your current situation is, but if you have any form of
IBD or<BR>
IBS, I would recommend finding the book (get it from the library and there
will<BR>
be no money spent) and trying the diet for a month. It can't hurt to try,
but<BR>
if it works, it will be such a good feeling!<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Deb<BR>
<BR>
PS, would you also like me to send you the testimonials from other people
and<BR>
articles on the diet?<BR>

Hi Deborah and Vicki,<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps Deborah whilst at the tail end of the diet may be introducing<BR>
normal foods again has introduced potatoes into her diet, but initially<BR>
potatoes(white or sweet),yams, parsnips are not allowed either. There are
a<BR>
few veges that are high in easily digestible complex carbohydrates that<BR>
should be included as part of the diet also since they help your energy
to<BR>
last:-<BR>
<BR>
Swede's(Rutagabas) and turnips, pumpkin and squash, green peas (if you can<BR>
tolerate the skins, they have more energy than potatoes per 100g), Zuchini<BR>
and other summer and winter squah and carrots.<BR>
<BR>
I've experienced a substantial increase in energy and that means calories<BR>
for those trying to pu on weight, since adding at least three of these<BR>
veges to my lunch and dinner!<BR>
&gt;<BR>

<BR>
Today, I had<BR>
&gt;a couple of urgent episodes but then everything seemed to calm down<BR>
&gt;some. Of course, I also became leary of putting any food into my gut<BR>
&gt;either. Has anyone else experienced this type of reaction? I have had<BR>
&gt;UC for 19 years but never gone through anything like that. I seem to<BR>
&gt;have a lot of what I consider good days and then wham. I have to remind<BR>
&gt;all that Elain'es diet does not work for me in it's entirety. There
are<BR>
&gt;foods on the diet I just cannot eat but I am following a lot of it<BR>
&gt;including eliminating the starches and sugars etc. I'd be interested
in<BR>
&gt;the feedback.<BR>
&gt; Thanks all,<BR>
&gt; Anne<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I've just gone through a similar reaction. Reaction to what I'm not<BR>
sure exactly but I have a few likely suspects:<BR>
<BR>
Dry curd cheese that may have been a bit off. This stuff doesn't seem to<BR>
keep for me more than a few days Then I realised that my fridge temperature<BR>
was turned all the way down (for winter) and we've been having some hot<BR>
days recently.<BR>
Cooking that was left out of the fridge overnight - then I was stupid<BR>
enough and hungry enough to eat it. finish cooling food by soaking dish
in<BR>
water and put in fridge before retiring at night.<BR>
Lack of sleep - burning the candle at both ends can bring on this reaction<BR>
<BR>
ANY DETOXIFICATION ROUTINE that is too harshly followed can also bring on
a<BR>
flare up. - I've been having a rare type of chinese massage that has made<BR>
me feel great (eliminating toxins) but my bowels always suffer for a few<BR>
days after. so I think this has to be undertaken gently. like wise there<BR>
are many other detox routines that would have a similar effect (BEETROOT<BR>
JUICE). Even the bodies own reaction to a cold or flu will trigger the<BR>
detox mechanisms which pour the waste toxins into the bowels, kidneys and<BR>
skin organs to be removed from the body.- mucous, diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
At this time I know how you feel about being scared to eat. I favour clear<BR>
fluids in these situations as opposed to the high meat content of the<BR>
introductory diet on page 51.(especially when I suspect a meat or cheese<BR>
born microbe) and have only had bottled apple cider for two days. and the<BR>
jelly made from it. and the pain has subsided greatly. today I feel &quot;clear&quot;<BR>
again. I've also supplemented this with 3 x 5mg serves of Musashi Kuan<BR>
(free form amino acids- no more than this recommended by Musashi)<BR>
<BR>
Detoxification or Microbial infection may be a possible reason for the<BR>
mystery flare ups that are to be expected from time to time at the early<BR>
stages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope that helps<BR>

Dear Anne,<BR>
<BR>
Here goes another try to compose mail. Hopefully it won't get sent in the<BR>
middle of a sentence this time.<BR>
<BR>
Process at highest speed in blender<BR>
3 hard boiled eggs<BR>
1 teaspoon salt<BR>
1 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard<BR>
1/2 teaspoon paprika<BR>
Honey to tast (approx 1 teaspoon)<BR>
2 tablespoons lemon juice<BR>
2 tablespoons white vinegar<BR>
<BR>
Slowly pour in 2 cups vegetable oil.<BR>
Blend in 1/2 envelope unflavored gelatin dissolved in 1/4 cup water.<BR>
<BR>
Chill and enjoy. This is delicious for deviled eggs.<BR>
<BR>
Note: When I tried this recipe I used a whole envelope unflavored gelatin.<BR>
My mayonnaise was too thick. I'm guessing 1/2 envelope would be about<BR>
right. It might take some more experimenting to get it just right. Let me<BR>
know how it turns out.<BR>

I have been on the SCD program for 2 1/2 months and the improvement is<BR>
tremendous. Most of the symtoms that I had for 7+ years and found very<BR>
annoying seemed to have disappeared. When I decided to go on the program
I<BR>
took the easy way out. I did not read the whole book only the pertinent<BR>
chapters of the the Yeas and Nays of what to eat. Then I plunged in without<BR>
regard to what I was eating or the quantity. Guess what, in spite of my<BR>
regimen I was improving. <BR>
<BR>
After reading various postings on how many ease into the correct eating<BR>
cycle I decided that it was now time for me to read the whole book. <BR>
<BR>
I must be very lucky and Elaine's Diet must have been just what the Doctor<BR>
should have ordered!! It really has made my life so much better.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the other benefits, my family is eatting healthier, I renewed my<BR>
interest in cooking and experimenting with various recipes. My mental<BR>
attitude has changed from &quot;if I can only eat just that, then I will
starve<BR>
to death?&quot; Now, I look at the program as something that I want to do
and<BR>
continue and not something that is a burden.<BR>
<BR>
Hope that this posting finds you in better health than yesterday!!!<BR>

Hi everybody, <BR>
<BR>
See below please. I am really glad that she is considering Elaine's diet.
Now<BR>
she knows<BR>
our group, I hope to introduce Elaine's diet and this group to many other<BR>
&quot;sufferers&quot; as well <BR>
and as soon as possible. That way I express my gratitude to Larry who introduced<BR>
Elaine's <BR>
diet to me, I was misled by the doctors... I paid my taxes to be misled
!<BR>
<BR>
Good night<BR>

Benito <BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt; Hi Benito,<BR>
<BR>
you can be sure that we'll be quite willing to try Elaine's diet instead
of<BR>
prednisone again<BR>
Gonna try sending a note to Deb Dowd and see if I'm really &quot;with the
group&quot; yet.<BR>
I have been getting all the mail (and it's great!).<BR>
<BR>

I was talking to the boichemist at a local juice mill who told me that<BR>
apple juice has sugar (sucrose) naturally occuring in it. I went looking<BR>
and found that the sugar content tables of foods from the USDA, list the<BR>
relative content of sugars. and some fruits have more sucrose than others.<BR>
Elaine said not to wory about some seeming contradictions in the diet but<BR>
there may be some caution required here. Bannanas listed by the USDA are<BR>
very high in sucrose. but these bananas tested may have been unripe since<BR>
I'm sure we have all learnt from experience that really ripe bananas treat<BR>
us better than the way they are sold in the supermarkets. this is because<BR>
the ripening process converts the indigestible sugars into fructose and<BR>
glucose.<BR>
<BR>
I made a bit of a list of &quot;preferred fruits&quot;:<BR>
Sorry,<BR>
<BR>
&#183; GRAPES are no1 they have almost no sucrose at all and are very,very
high in<BR>
glucose and fructose (probably why they're on the introductory diet as<BR>
grape juice.<BR>
&#183; PRUNES are also very good in this regard,dried or as juice.<BR>
&#183; KIWI fruit<BR>
&#183; Very ripe BANANAS (with black spots) <BR>
&#183; LIMES, in preference to lemons<BR>
&#183; Most BERRIES except strawberries<BR>
&#183; RAISINS and other DRIED FRUIT. (Most dried fruits had zero sucrose
except<BR>
for dates which were phenomenally high. They probably used the sticky<BR>
glazed ones that Elaine warns about for their testing)<BR>
&#183; POMEGRANATES<BR>
&#183; PEARS<BR>
&#183; CHERRIES<BR>
&#183; RHUBARB (not much of any sugar in this. but still a good food)<BR>
&#183; AVOCADOES (again not much of any sugar but still high in fibre and
good fats)<BR>
<BR>
These will constitute my preferred fruits from now on.<BR>
<BR>

People,<BR>
<BR>
I have been on this new diet (Elaines' simple Carb diet) at 100 percent
=<BR>
for about a week and am on prednisone at 30mg a day. I am not asking =<BR>
anyone to be a doctor but was wondering for those of you that were on =<BR>
prednisone and were on this diet - how soon did you start reducing your
=<BR>
dosage and what were the symptoms that you had in the process. I =<BR>
personally have very serious attacks if I reduce the prednisone too =<BR>
much.=20<BR>
I have had Chrons for 12 years and a year ago was the first time that I
=<BR>
had one of these &quot; attacks&quot; that last about 15 minutes to an hour
and is =<BR>
always about 2 hours after I eat. These attacks feel as much as I can =<BR>
tell exactly what it would feel like if someone where to take a huge =<BR>
knife and jam it in my stomach area in the center about an inch below =<BR>
the rib cage and start twisting it continually. I was driving when it =<BR>
first hit me and I thought that It was my time to leave this earth and =<BR>
go to a better place. It felt far worse then when I got admitted to the
=<BR>
hospital for food poisoning for 3 days 13 years ago. I had food =<BR>
poisoning not much prior to being diagnosed with Chrons. ( I actually =<BR>
was diagnosed with Cholitis back then but was rediagnosed with Chrons =<BR>
last year). I also have been trying to find out more details about other
=<BR>
people that have it and am trying to find out what might be causing it.
=<BR>
In the last two years my brother and my father have been diagnosed with
=<BR>
Cholitis as well.=20<BR>
I would appreciate it if I could get some feedback from others as well.=20<BR>
<BR>
My second question...hopefully it won't be so long winded this time....<BR>
What are some of the side effects that anyone has gotten from being on =<BR>
prednisone...personally me I have really bad acne because of it, moody,
=<BR>
It might be causing hair loss but not sure if that is just because it is
=<BR>
my time for that...(i am 27), knee joints seem swollen and hurt some. i
=<BR>
have been on Prednisone for about a 10 months going from 40mg slowly =<BR>
down to 25mg and then back up to 40mg again because I get the &quot;attacks&quot;
=<BR>
again.=20<BR>
<BR>
My Third question is Should I be exercising while on prednisone?...I ask
=<BR>
that because I don't want to blow out my knees if this prednisone is =<BR>
weakening my joints. If so what is the best exercise to be doing. My =<BR>
knees swell when exercising by the way.=20<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your support, I really appreciate it. I have been feeling
=<BR>
pretty isolated with this illness over the years.=20<BR>

&gt;Subject: Re: prednisone.....<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Hi Ted,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I started the diet on May 1 of this year and immediately started feeling<BR>
relief from my Chron's symptoms. I was on 10mg/day alternating with<BR>
15mg/day of prednisone at the time and was coming off a pretty severe flare.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Since May, I've been slowly tapering the prednisone following a schedule<BR>
designed by my doctor. I'm currently down to 2mg/day. I wish I were<BR>
tapering faster since I don't feel that I need it. I don't know if I had
any<BR>
real prednisone side effects (I've been taking it for 2 years), maybe some<BR>
mild acne.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I was running about 20 mile/week when I began the diet and I've continued<BR>
the running since. Once and a while I get sore knees but I just take a day<BR>
or two off to rest and the soreness goes away. I've heard that<BR>
weight-bearing excercise is good for folks on prednisone because it counters<BR>
the bone-thinning that is a side effect of long-term use.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I'm about your age (30, diagnosed 8 years ago) and I belief that the<BR>
excercise I get complements the SCD diet therapy - but then I always thought<BR>
that excercise helped my chron's symptoms, even before the diet.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Best Wishes,<BR>

Thanks Micheal for all your work setting up the list server, now that our

family is growing so large it's very welcome.<BR>
<BR>
There's been recent discussion about mayonaise and salmonella. The risk
<BR>
is pretty small but I guess we each have to consider it. I've been using
<BR>
the mayonaise with raw eggs for about a year now and I've never had any
<BR>
ill effects. Each time I make a batch it'll last me for about a week. I
<BR>
love sauces and gravies so the mayonaise was a real life saver when I <BR>
first went on the diet.<BR>
<BR>
For any IBSers in the group there is a new support group: <BR>
alt.support.ibs. Its now provided by my server but as yet hasn't been <BR>
getting too much activity.<BR>

Those of you who frequent the Crohn's site must have seen &quot;Kitty's&quot;
cure for<BR>
IBD, namely Colodyne. I inquired about this and she sent me this email...<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt;The colodyne removes toxins,yeast overgrowth and the mucosal buildup
that<BR>
the microbes get into and do the damage. It has digestive enzymes and good<BR>
bacteria as well as herbs and a parasite killer.<BR>
<BR>
It is gentle,no starch,sugar or yeast and stops the cramps,and the runs
.<BR>

I was ready to die i was so sick and I would lose all my food. Even<BR>
supliments would not stay in long enough for me to absorb them. It was awful<BR>

Anybody heard of this or tried it? We should elect volunteer guinea pigs
on a<BR>
rotating basis to check out these remedies one by one as they come up.<BR>
<BR>
I am currently trying a gimmick that my sister in law got me on, supposedly<BR>
flushes parasites out of the system by the bowlful, yeast included. No<BR>
parasites for me yet, but stay tuned! (This product appears to be making
me<BR>
sick with flu symptoms but I'm going to hang in there for a while yet.)
This<BR>
company claims that in a healthy digestive system there is a balance of
85%<BR>
lactobacillus and other healthy bacteria and 15% unfriendly bacteria etc
that<BR>
are kept well in check by the body. In a sick system the balance is reversed,<BR>
with only 15% healthy bacteria to 85% of the bad guys. That made sense to
me,<BR>
and I thought if they claim they can rectify this balance in the space of
90<BR>
days then bring it on. However I must say that I was getting better results<BR>
with just the diet and none of this sickness to keep me down.<BR>
(Next I must inquire about their money back guarantee!)<BR>

Thanks for the info about the sucrose in fruits. I was wondering if they<BR>
gave you the amounts in grams for the different fruits. I think that a<BR>
teaspoon of table sugar has about 4 g, so I was wondering how the amounts
in<BR>
the fruits with the higher concentrations would compare.<BR>
<BR>
Everyone:<BR>
I don't understand why we would be allowed to have sucrose in fruits but
not<BR>
as table sugar or any other forms of sugar. When I talk to my friends about<BR>
it they feel that it is because it is a natural sugar, but it's still a<BR>
disaccharide. And I always thought that whether something was natural or<BR>
not didn't make a difference. Sucrose is sucrose is sucrose, the chemical<BR>
structure is what defines it. So, forgive my ignorance, but does anyone<BR>
know what exactly it is in the refining of sugar that is so bad?<BR>
<BR>
Also, I have received the following letters from Bill Laing of the group
and<BR>
I am forwarding them for him.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Well tnx you very much Tina and hello to all the others in the group.<BR>

&gt;errors plse correct me. This mail bounced twice,so I will try it this
way. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Nice to meet you Tina, sorry to hear you are having a flare up with
your<BR>
&gt;U.C.hope you can find the cause of it. Perhaps just a small oversight
in<BR>
&gt;your diet. Elaine Gottschall spoke of flare ups early into the diet,and<BR>
&gt;didnt know the cause, nor the cure. Sometimes it can be the silliest
little<BR>
&gt;things.<BR>
&gt;Cream in my coffee does it for me, in short order. So hang in there
on the<BR>
&gt;diet, you may well solve your problem sooner than you think. Yes I think
I<BR>
&gt;will take you up on that offer for the bread recipe. And no I never
bought<BR>
&gt;the new book, havent worn the old one out yet. If I can help you with<BR>
&gt;anything just give me a shout. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;You where disscussing strawberries with someone ealier.I have a question<BR>
&gt;regarding both stawberries and rasberries, I have heard the small seed
on<BR>
&gt;these berries can become lodged in the flutes of the intestines, and<BR>
&gt;wondering if this to be a fact. Perhaps someone can help me with that
one.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The first attempt at the diet for me was three and ahalf years ago.
A few<BR>
&gt;errors and afew months later the diet worked wonders for me. I have
nothing<BR>
&gt;but praise for it. If I had given up on the first try, I would now be
able<BR>
&gt;to say the diet didnt work for me. Somethings take seem to require more
than<BR>
&gt;one attempt. This diet in my opinion is worthy of any number of attempts.
I<BR>
&gt;do understand it well may not work for in very instance.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Deb A.Dowb<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Hello Deb, tnx for getting bk to me as quickly as you did. You must
get up<BR>
&gt;before the roster crows by the time shown on your note to me.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Just wished to say I appriecated you sending me the copies of the<BR>
&gt;conversations of the group with Elaine Gottschall. Very intresting.
I<BR>
&gt;enjoyed it emmensely. tnx you agn.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Tnx u kindly for the recipe, I will try it out this week end likely
as not.<BR>
&gt;It looks delicious. Particularly since it has been three years and six<BR>
&gt;months , since I last had any bread, buns or muffins. But the one that
got<BR>
&gt;to me most was no toast.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;In my opinion Tina, the biggest obstacle in applying this diet is<BR>
&gt;overcomming the &quot; Poor me syndrome&quot; &quot;Why did this have
to happen to me?&quot;<BR>
&gt;once I got beyond that stage it really doesnt matter what I eat as long
as<BR>
&gt;it is healthy, and doesnt bother My digestive track. Food and the way
I eat<BR>
&gt;it has taken on a entirely different meaning. eg mealtime is any time
I am<BR>
&gt;hungery. Once I eat and keep some food in the tummy, food is much less
of<BR>
&gt;intrest. The hungery a person gets the more difficult the diet appears.
So I<BR>
&gt;found small meals and often was the key for me. I will do the fruits
and<BR>
&gt;veggies, cooked or raw all day , generally one good meal a day including<BR>
&gt;some form of meat, fish or chicken. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Dont mean to preach to any one, this is simply how I found it best for
me. <BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Yes I agree on the messages, I never saw any of the messages I sent
to the<BR>
&gt;group . I tried sending three different messages to you on four different<BR>
&gt;occassians. They kept comimg back marked &quot;mail box full, try later&quot;.
Untill<BR>
&gt;I sent this message direct to you as well Deb. Deb sent me a note saying
she<BR>
&gt;had recieved all of them. So I am lost at this point, I am not sure
which<BR>
&gt;one went where. However it is not a big deal.If you wish to drop this
on to<BR>
&gt;the list server plse do providing you think it may add some thing for
the<BR>
group.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I had asked regarding strawberries, but saw no replies to same. (Seeds)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Take care good health<BR>

I got your message fine. I saw colodyne on the web somewhere. I can't get<BR>
it here in Australia, but I noticed that the main ingredient is a very old<BR>
one for ibd and that's slippery elm bark as well as the acidophilus.<BR>
Slipery Elm is great for absorbing toxins and acts like a sponge to soak<BR>
them up. it also adds fibre to keep the peristalsis going, but when things<BR>
are really bad even this can be too abrasive. thats when a drip or liquid<BR>
food is needed.<BR>
<BR>

Sharon: Thank you for your response to my question about tomatoes and <BR>
tomato juice. I couldn't stand the thought of not being able to make <BR>
sauce from tomato juice. Thanks too for the receipe for mayonnaise with
<BR>
hard boiled eggs. I'm a little surprised about the unflavored gelatin <BR>
but what the heck.<BR>
<BR>
Matt: I am glad to hear about your feeling better. They say something <BR>
in the nicotine helps. There has been so much talk about smoking lately
<BR>
that I am having a hard time keeping from buying a pack myself. <BR>
Tomorror will bake one year I've been smoke free.<BR>
Thanks also for the reply re BM's - I have been extra tired lately and <BR>
under some extra stress. Actually, when I had my flare up this time, I <BR>
didn't get the rest I needed then and so instead of storing up energy, I
<BR>
think I have been borrowing every day. I find myself try to reload at <BR>
the end of each day and on the weekends. You may have found what my <BR>
answer is. Thanks again.<BR>
<BR>
Michael: Thank you for clearing up the misunderstanding on my part <BR>
about the tomato juice. I am glad to hear I can use canned tomatoes. I <BR>
only make sauce once a week and use very little on my pasta. Actually, <BR>
I haven't had pasta either but I want to try it on spaghetti squash. I <BR>
appreciate your response to my sudden flare of BM activity and the calm.
<BR>
I didn't stop to realize there were so many things that could have <BR>
triggered the reactions. I think being tired and stressed probably did <BR>
it to me because I have been eating basically the same foods for weeks <BR>
now. I will also consider you response about raw eggs. Sharon has a <BR>
different recipe for mayonnaise you might want to consider.<BR>
<BR>
To everyone: This is a great, supportive group. I consider it a <BR>
privilege to be a part of it.<BR>

Ted,<BR>
<BR>
I am only speaking as the mother of a child with Crohn's and who is taking<BR>
prednisone so I guess you are getting the information kind of second hand
as<BR>
I personally am not feeling the things that my son does. <BR>
<BR>
My son has been taking prednisone now for 3 1/2 years. He has been on doses<BR>
as high as 35 mg./daily and is currently on 2.5 mg./daily. When he was<BR>
taking the higher doses he had the moon face, weight gain overall, high
blood<BR>
pressure problems and joint pain. He has always continued to play soccer<BR>
which did seem to cause his joints to hurt him more afterward but we simply<BR>
iced them and took some ibupropen (not sure if it is allowed on the diet).<BR>
He has seen a rheumatologist and a orthopedic doctor concerning his joint<BR>
pain and the fact that he developed a chronic limp but they could find no<BR>
arthritis and only slight mechanical problems. <BR>
<BR>
We have been on the diet now for about 4 months and he is doing absolutely<BR>
fantastic. When we started the diet he was taking higher doses of prednisone<BR>
along with and immunosuppressant drug and had developed Crohn's symptoms<BR>
again (bloody diarrhea). I insisted they take him off of the<BR>
immunosuppressants and we started the diet (although the doctor was quite<BR>
skeptical about what benefit it could have but admitted it couldn't hurt).<BR>
He was off the immunosuppressants within 2 months but had improved to not<BR>
bleeding and solid stools, 1-2 daily. We have since lowered his prednisone<BR>
dose and so far so good. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, being a child, he has cheated on the diet on occasion but has<BR>
informed me that when he does cheat he has diarrhea all the next day and<BR>
sometimes two days afterwards. He has never experienced severe stomach pain<BR>
with his Crohn's only the loose stools, bleeding and used to have chronic<BR>
nausea at his worst.<BR>
<BR>
Don't know if this will be of any value to you as I am talking about a child<BR>
and speaking second hand to boot but I can say that the diet has worked
for<BR>
us and has become easier to deal with as time goes on. The only time we
have<BR>
problems sticking with the diet now is when I don't plan ahead and get into
a<BR>
pinch for something appealing to eat or snack on.<BR>
<BR>
Mac and Michael,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your input on watermelon. I guess we will keep on eating it.
It<BR>
is a favorite summer fruit and the only melon my son will touch. He did
eat<BR>
strawberries when they were in season and I make fruit shakes with the frozen<BR>
strawberries and no adverse reactions there. He also loves frozen grapes
and<BR>
eats them like candy.<BR>
<BR>
Also, thanks for all your work on the listserver, Michael, it will be<BR>
terrific not to have to try and keep up with all the changes in the mailing<BR>
list.<BR>
<BR>
Sharon,<BR>
We tried your recipe for mayonnaise and it turned out great. I had to use<BR>
lime juice as I was out of lemons so it is a little strong on the citrus<BR>
taste but my son says it is yummy and tastes great in tuna salad. I had<BR>
looked at the ingredients of Egg Beaters eggs and they appear to be usable<BR>
unless we aren't supposed to have guar gum. The other brands list starch
as<BR>
an ingredient but no the Egg Beaters brand and they are pastuerized which<BR>
would make them safer.<BR>
<BR>
I know Elaine has said that she wouldn't recommend anyone drinking Lactaid<BR>
milk on a regular basis but would it hurt to drink it on occasion and I<BR>
thought she said that using in recipes was acceptable. My main concern is<BR>
that my growing child (which his growth has picked up as we lowered his<BR>
prednisone dose) gets enough calcium. I am going to try the yogurt again
but<BR>
so far it has been rejected as disgusting. I do give him hard cheeses and
he<BR>
is supposed to be on a somewhat low calcium diet due to having a kidney
stone<BR>
disease that can be controlled by diet.<BR>
<BR>
I have some more recipes to share but am currently busy trying to get my<BR>
three back in school and have been working on moving my parents to Florida<BR>
from Alabama to get them closer to family so I will forward them as soon
as I<BR>
have a little extra time.<BR>

This is my first posting as I'm new to the group.<BR>
<BR>
Hi there, my name is Marla. I'm a graduate student at the University of
<BR>
Waterloo in Canada (outside Toronto) and I have had UC for about 2 years.
<BR>
It's isolated in my sigmoid and rectum, which is not exactly severe but
I <BR>
get a lot of bleeding, pain and diarrhea when it is active. <BR>
<BR>
I recently had a bad flare (which was accompanied by an intestinal virus
<BR>
I believe) and I've had problems eating and sleeping for about a month.
<BR>
My GI just upped my meds (to 12 from 8 tablets of Asacol and nightly <BR>
Salofalk enemas from 1 every other nite) and told me diet really has <BR>
little to do with my disease and I should eat whatever doesn't bother me.
<BR>
<BR>
HA! Well after losing about 10 pds (i'm only 5&quot;2 and 115 to begin with)
I <BR>
decided to try the scd. I've had the first book for about 1.5 years now
<BR>
and everytime I flare I read it. I always shake my head and say &quot;There's
<BR>
just no way I can do it!&quot;....<BR>
<BR>
Well I've started it and I feel better already. Now this could be because
<BR>
my intestinal virus is disappearing (I went to a herbalist for that) or
<BR>
that the meds helped. I don't want to be on ANY meds. I've decreased my
<BR>
pill intake back to 8 and take 2 days a week off the enemas. I still have
<BR>
diarrhea a bit but my bathroom trips are under 5 a day.<BR>
<BR>
I have a few beginner questions about the diet (I actually spoke to <BR>
Elaine but before I committed to beginning this diet):<BR>
<BR>
1. Aren't the amount of eggs and butter used in the bread and other <BR>
recipes a bit too high...I don't want to go from colon problems to heart
<BR>
problems.<BR>
<BR>
2. Has anyone ever tried to make pasta with nut flour?<BR>
<BR>
3. What about Lactaid occasionally?<BR>
<BR>
4. How do you deal with going out to eat? I love things like Sushi and <BR>
Italian and now I ain't gonna be able to eat it...not to mention <BR>
chocolate, beer and mmmmmm donuts (which I love)...<BR>
<BR>
5. It seems that I'm not going to get enough Calcium. What do I eat/take
<BR>
for a supplement?<BR>
<BR>
I guess that's all I have right now...I'm just most worried about the <BR>
eggs and butter use.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
<BR>
Take it easy,<BR>
Marla<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Welcome Marla!<BR>
<BR>
glad to have you here. If your a lover of chocolate,beer and donuts, I<BR>
would be more worried about those as health concerns than butter and eggs.<BR>
Beer is very high in yeast that doesn't help the yeast problems that IBD<BR>
patients have. Chocolate and donuts vitamin stealers that rob vital organs<BR>
of the body including the heart of vitamins and minerals that are essential<BR>
in order to complete the digestive process of these &quot;empty&quot; (of
vitamins)<BR>
calories. The diet is not strict about how or when you eat, just what foods<BR>
yu have to choose from. so you must still keep it as balanced as possible.<BR>
5 food groups, substituting legumes, starchy vegetables and fruit for the<BR>
lack of cereals in the diet. It is not a low calorie diet so see a<BR>
dietition to work out a balanced version of the diet that includes foods<BR>
and recipes you will enjoy.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;1. Aren't the amount of eggs and butter used in the bread and other<BR>
&gt;recipes a bit too high...I don't want to go from colon problems to heart<BR>
&gt;problems.<BR>
<BR>
Look in a recipe book and see that the amount of butter used in the scd<BR>
cakes is no more than traditional recipes. The eggs are up a bit, but you<BR>
can balance that out by cutting down on red meat (saturated fats) Its the<BR>
egg yolk that's the problem. (buy fat modified eggs from hens fed a low
fat<BR>
diet). As for the whites you can have as many as you like. with impunity.<BR>
whites are virtually pure protein. Athletes have up to a dozen a day. but<BR>
only 2-3 yolks<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;2. Has anyone ever tried to make pasta with nut flour?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
It wouldn't work since nut flour doesn't stick together of it's own accord.<BR>
you have to have egg to hold it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;3. What about Lactaid occasionally?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
That's mentioned in the book. but I wouldn't since I value my liver highly<BR>
<BR>
&gt;4. How do you deal with going out to eat? I love things like Sushi and<BR>
&gt;Italian and now I ain't gonna be able to eat it...not to mention<BR>
&gt;chocolate, beer and mmmmmm donuts (which I love)...<BR>
<BR>
I tend to invite people to my place where I can enjoy their company in<BR>
private, rely on the toilet facilities and control the food and still enjoy<BR>
their company and association. Chinese without soy sauce is about the best<BR>
Restaurant food I've found. A plate of steamed vegetables or salad without<BR>
dressing. My safest takeaway is BBQ chicken and Roast pumpkin. (one shop<BR>
near me puts sugar on the pumpkin another does not so be careful)<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;5. It seems that I'm not going to get enough Calcium. What do I eat/take<BR>
&gt;for a supplement?<BR>
<BR>
Dark leafy green vegetables eaten raw (spinach juice (with carrot juice)<BR>
and as a salad) taken daily provide all the ORGANIC calcium you need.<BR>
Calcium supplements are not food; they're generally inorganic and are best<BR>
put on the garden. The highest known food source of calcium is tahini which<BR>
can be mixed with cooked beans, eg lima - for a high calcium high protein<BR>
low fat meal.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
I really recomend you look at some general natural health books (fit for<BR>
life is a good place to start) to get an idea of balanced diet. since most<BR>
of us are ex-junk food junkies.<BR>
<BR>

Peanuts are reknown amongst naturopaths for being a problem with sensitive<BR>
people. The most common objection to them that I've heard is mould. this
is<BR>
logical since they are havested from under the ground. whereas most othe<BR>
nuts are picked from a tree.<BR>
<BR>
maybe thats why people have more success with the other types of nuts.<BR>

On a lighter note, Barb, I wondered if you had tried something like the
<BR>
following to see if your son would eat yoghurt because I think the <BR>
yoghurt may be one of the key parts of this diet. I also said Yuck I'm <BR>
not eating yoghurt in the beginning. What I do is buy frozen <BR>
blueberries, and frozen strawberries and frozen blackberries. I take out
<BR>
a mix of these frozen berries, unfreeze them in the microwave which tends
<BR>
to make a nice juice along with the berries, then I usually add some <BR>
other kind of fresh fruit like grapes or peaches. I add the yoghurt and
<BR>
mix it all together and top it off with some honey to take away that sort
<BR>
of tart flavour the yoghurt gets from fermenting so long. If you haven't
<BR>
tried this you might, it's pretty good and the yoghurt kind of gets <BR>
buried under everything else. For anyone who manages to make pancakes <BR>
or french toast or anything like that, this is a mixture we used to use
<BR>
to top things like pancakes or waffles before I went on the diet.<BR>

Chris,<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your suggestions concerning making the yogurt more palatable.
I<BR>
definitely plan on trying it. I had planned to make more yogurt just to
try<BR>
the pancake recipe and chicken nugget recipe that was given out but so far
I<BR>
haven't gotten around to it. I have problems working out meal preparations<BR>
where I don't need to use my oven as that is what I use to make the yogurt<BR>
and tying it up for 24-48 hours is terribly inconvenient sometimes especially<BR>
for someone who prepares a full meal every evening. <BR>

Marla,<BR>
Welcome to the group!<BR>
You mentionned living without doughnuts etc. I can't believe all the doughnut<BR>
shops and cinnamon bun shops and all the people that can eat these things
with<BR>
no ill effects!! Avoiding these foods is 90% not a problem for me anymore<BR>
because the revenge of the intestinal system is swift and sure. I am 40
and<BR>
have felt quite sick for 20 years, and was getting much worse very quickly.
I<BR>
was desperate and nothing was helping me. For me, I would have done anything
to<BR>
be well again, so giving up various foods pales in comparison to the hope
of<BR>
being well. Now I am most certainly improved and some days would even say
I am<BR>
well. In this situation, a doughnut has reduced appeal!!!<BR>
<BR>
Hope you enjoy the group -<BR>
