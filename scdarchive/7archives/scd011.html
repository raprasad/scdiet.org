Dear Deborah,
<BR>
I was so happy to hear how well you are doing on the diet and that you want to
help spread the word. Thank you for calling and offering support for this long
crusade that my husband and I have carried on. I kept copying letters until I got
tired. There have been hundreds of others who have written and hundreds who have
called to report the good news but have not written although I have asked them to
do so. In addition, it is most probable that only one in one hundred will even
contact me. We have sold 115,000 books and people keep passing books around. In
addition, doctors are using it (mainly holistic, chiropractors, and naturopaths)
and some have copied parts of the book and distributed same to patients. So all
in all, I imagine there must be at least 50,000 people who are leading more
normal lives after the diet has helped.
<BR>
We have seen that it has not budged the powers-to-be so all we can do is keep
plugging on. So many medical doctors have used the diet on their wives, children,
and themselves. Many have recovered but yet they do not tell their patients. I
have other articles written by people who have gotten so angry that they have
accused Crohn's and Colitis as waging some kind of conspiracy. One woman is a
novelist and while reviewing a book, injected a condemnation of the Crohn's and
Colitis Assoc. She is being punished by the paper as she has had no reviews
offered to her since. I have not included articles such as these as they can make
you very angry and that will not accomplish anything. What you intend to do
sounds much more positive.<BR>

<BR>

Keep in touch and keep getting better.<BR>

<BR>

Sincerely,<BR>

Elaine Gottschall<BR><BR><BR>

This file is a compilation of Testimonials that I have gathered over the past
several months from people who have tried or are trying the Specific Carbohydrate
Diet. Also, I asked for and received a group of letters that were written to
Elaine herself from other people on her diet. The intention of this compilation
is to &quot;spread the word&quot; on the diet and let people know that there
might be an alternative to Surgery and/or Medication. <BR>

Hi, I'm responding to your note on the Gottschall diet. I've been using 
it for about 4 months with reasonable success. When I started the diet I had 
instant success for about 2 weeks. Then I started to get diarrhea 2 or 3 times 
a week and couldn't figure out the cause. But I stuck fastidiously to the diet
and have
slowly improved. Twice now I've managed to go nearly two weeks 
without problems. However, I still get diarrhea for no apparent reason. I read
that as the
undesirable bacteria in the gut die they release toxins. Perhaps this could
explain 
the diarrhea. <BR>

<BR>
Six weeks ago I started taking a daily tablet of lactodophillus and I've seen 
improvement. I'd be interested to know how you follow the diet as it is a bit
restrictive.
 I'm using it to cope with my chronic diarrhea that was diagnosed as IBS. How
about you?<BR>

The basic rules of the Gottschall diet are to avoid all disaccharides
and polysaccharides (most sugars and starches). The theory (explained
in the book) is that our guts cannot break down these long-chain molecules 
into their smallest units (monosaccharides) which are absorbed into the 
blood. If these are not broken down by our bodies, bacteria in the gut can 
eat them and grow out of control. So, if we only eat monosaccharides, we 
can absorb them without needing to break them down and the 'bad&quot; bacteria
starve.
Among the things to avoid are: bread, cereals, pasta, and anything
else made with flour; rice, potatoes, anything with added sugar or
starch (most canned/processed foods); most dairy products (lactose is
a disaccharide). Your diet is mostly fresh/frozen meat, fish,
vegetables, and fruit. You can also eat nuts, eggs, and some cheeses.
The book includes recipes such as breads, cakes, and cookies made with
nut flour.<BR>

Overall, it is NOT an unhealthy diet. However, it would be difficult
for vegetarians because tofu and most soy-based products cannot be
eaten, so protein can be harder to come by. I've been on it for over
a year and am symptom free as long as I don't cheat. It doesn't work
for everyone, but I cannot think of any reason not to give it a shot.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>[Found at the IBD and IBS and UC page]<BR><BR>I have been using the
Gottschall Diet to help control UC since Oct.94.<BR>

There is a specific BLAND diet listed in her book, but it's totally 
different from what is normally considered bland. When I have a flair, 
I resort back to that diet and it helps ease the problems. 
About a year ago I had was having severe problems and was put on 
Rowasa to help calm the bleeding and D. I couldn't use the enemas.
As soon as they were administered, it felt as though like I'd been jabbed 
with an ice pick.<BR><BR>Since following the diet, I have responded better to ALL
medications.
I had to use Rowasa again just a couple of weeks ago, and this time 
I only had a problem on the second night. After that, there was no pain 
when using the medication.<BR>

Hope this info is helpful.<BR>

I have Ulcerative Colitis, and was not having luck with any meds 
before starting the Gottschall diet in Oct. 94. Currently, I am nearly
symptom free. I watch what I eat and take Asacol, Bentyl, and Rowasa.
I have two or three trips to the bathroom in the morning and then I'm 
fine for the day. Two years ago, I was going at least once an hour.
Hope this info is helpful. Good luck and good health.

dietary therapy for crohn's<BR>
<BR>

This article submitted by d. h. on 11/9/95.<BR><BR>I have had Crohn's for seven
years and my condition has progressively deteriorated. Two months ago, I began
the &quot;Gottschall&quot; diet, which involves eliminating all carbohydrates
(grains, complex sugars) and introducing homemade yogurt (without lactose). I am
curious if anyone has successfully treated their Crohn's disease through similar
dietary methods. It worked immediately for me, coming out of a bad flare-up.
However, I am also on prednisone. Now that I am lowering my dosage (I'm currently
on 20 mg.), I am experiencing blood and mucus at the beginning of my bowel
movements and my intestines feel inflamed. The diet claims that in the second or
third month a relapse can occur. I want to keep tapering the prednisone and am
frustrated at such a relapse. Has anyone experienced a similar occurrence? And
what foods have people discovered they can and cannot tolerate? This is a crucial
time; I feel if I can get through this, then my intestines may actually keep
healing. Advice?<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>[Found at the IBD and IBS and UC page]<BR><BR>I've had CD diagnosed for
13 yrs. I've also had several operations. I stuck to
 a diet of no wheat, no corn (not even traces of corn flour or oil), no coffee,
no 
alcohol, and no dairy. Following this regimen I had much less cramping for 
two years. Unfortunately the diet was so boring I started eating a wider variety 
of foods. This was also encouraged by my doctors. Now I still get ill
periodically.<BR>

<BR><BR> [Found at the IBD and IBS and UC page ]<BR><BR>Sorry if I say this too
often but the diet has been wonderful for me. Yes, the diet 
has helped tremendously. I leave out fructose, lactose and gluten. I don't wake
up
 in the night any more, bleeding has almost stopped, and everything is MUCH
better 
for this UC sufferer. I'm determined to get well. Taking a healthy large dose of 
liquid calcium seemed to help and I'm trying a dried Aloe Vera
capsule.<BR><BR>Keep trying, diet is VERY IMPORTANT.

Cycle&quot;<BR>

The book is about a specific carbohydrate diet. Basically, you can't eat 
grains, potatoes, processed sugars and a list of other things. Beef, chicken, 
pork, fish, nuts, and most veggies and fruits are OK. I very skeptical 
about these diets, but after 4 months I can say that my CD symptoms 
have improved. It is definitely worth a try. I found the book 
at the bookstore in a local mall. Anyway, if you want to try to

My husband was on the diet for 6 months and it didn't work for him. <BR>

At first it seem to help but then when he wound up in the hospital 
with his worst flare up ever. After that, we decided it wasn't for him. <BR>

Good luck, maybe it will work for you. <BR><BR>Just because it didn't work for
us, doesn't mean it won't work. We stuck
to it religiously but to no avail. <BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>[Here is my experience with Crohn's and the Specific Carbohydrate
Diet]<BR><BR>Originally, I was diagnosed in September 1986 when emergency surgery
revealed what two years of tests (and incredible pain, mental stress and weight
loss) did not: a mass of Crohn's tissue. The doctors removed the diseased
sections and gave me a temporary illeostomy. In December 1986, my intestine was
reconnected and I experienced no symptoms for almost a year. During that time, I
participated in several community activities, worked full time as a postal
carrier (walking an eleven mile route carrying a thirty pound mail sack), and
enjoyed life without illness or even thinking about illness.<BR><BR>In July 1987,
symptoms began again. By October, I was forced to quit my physical job and in
December began a desk job. By February, my symptoms were bad enough to put me in
the hospital. There I spent a week being fed an elemental diet via NG tube. This
time they knew what was wrong and didn't waste telling me I was anorexic or just
a &quot;nervous type.&quot; I felt better almost immediately from the elemental
diet treatment. A few weeks later I became pregnant which put me in what I
considered remission--no pain, only diarrhea. I became pregnant a second time
before symptoms returned. After my second pregnancy, when my son was nearly one
year old, I began to have problems again. I coped with it experimenting with
different foods. I found some success by following a low fat diet and avoiding
popcorn, nuts and beans. Although I wasn't symptom free, I could live with it. I
became pregnant a third time and symptoms slowed again. After my youngest child
was a year old, my health!<BR>

 spiraled downward faster and harder than ever before. Once a week, I had severe
flare which lasted twenty four hours and from which it took me another twenty
four hours to &quot;recover.&quot; Also, I began finding blood in my stool,
something new and scary to deal with! I couldn't seem to find anything safe to
eat--EVERYTHING seemed to cause problems.<BR><BR>
For six months, I waited for a specialist to assess how bad my Crohn's had
become. I had never been on any medication for Crohn's. I hadn't even SEEN a
gastroenterologist since my elemental diet treatment in Feb 1988! While I waiting
for my appointment and continuing to get worse, I got online. In September 1995,
I read someone's e-mail saying she was CURED of Crohn's by going on the Specific
Carbohydrate Diet. My interest was aroused!! She recommended reading
&quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet&quot; by Elaine
Gottschall which I immediately ordered.<BR><BR>When I received the book and read
the diet, I thought, &quot;No way. Many of the things she says are safe to eat
have caused me problems in the past.&quot; However, with the encouragement of
another person on the diet, and still waiting to be seen by a specialist, I
committed myself to follow the diet strictly for one month, the recommended
length of time to see if the diet will help. Within a week, I noticed definite
positive changes. My abdomen felt weird after eating. Then I realized that I was
waiting for the usual digestion pains to come and THEY DIDN'T! By the end of the
month, I was symptom-free. <BR><BR>After the first month I cheated a couple times
and experience four days price of pain, bloating, and diarrhea. I have now been
on the diet for over three months and I am in it for the &quot;long haul.&quot;
Even though I know that I could cheat and then use the diet to feel better, it
isn't worth it. I'm shooting for the long term goal of being able to eat as I
choose. In her book, Mrs. Gottschall says that after two years on the diet, a
Crohn's Patient can challenge the &quot;illegal&quot; foods one at a time. If
they give no problems, they may be eaten in moderation once again.
<BR><BR>Besides a lessening of the Crohn's symptoms, I've experienced other
benefits while on this diet. Since no lactose is allowed, my sinuses have
completely cleared. Before that I always thought my nose kept dripping due to
allergies! In addition, the strength and stamina I have now are comparable to the
year immediately following my surgery in 1986. I no longer have to rest after
grocery shopping so that I can bring the bags from the car to the house. I can DO
so many things now that before were UNTHINKABLE. I'm HEALTHY! It is truly an
incredible feeling!!<BR><BR>I'm still waiting to see the specialist (my
appointment is next month!) but within the last few weeks my family doctor has
prescribed azulfidine to help keep me in remission. While I don't think it's
necessary, I'm taking the tablets as a compromise. He talked to a
gastroenterologist about my symptoms from four months ago and together they felt
I should go on steroids--without even examining me! In my opinion, the
&quot;maintenance dose&quot; of Azulfidine is much safer. As many people have
already learned, most doctors don't believe that diet and Crohn's have much to do
with each other!<BR><BR>BTW, I don't get any money from this book or diet. In
fact, I'm spending A LOT of money online telling everyone about it!! (Too much!!)
I just can't believe that more people don't know about this diet! I wrote to the
CCFA (Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America) asking them if they have
reviewed the diet at all. Their reply was that while they are aware of the diet,
they have not studied it. Oh well. <BR><BR>The book probably can be found at the
library. That way, you could try it for a month without spending any money, if
you want. (If not, any library or bookstore can order it with the ISBN#) The
basic premise of the diet is to avoid all lactose, all refined sugar and all
grains. It is tough, but the book gives helpful alternative recipes. <BR><BR>I am
interested in hearing from other people who have tried the diet, both good and
bad results. I have been compiling testimonials on the diet to share with others.
If anyone has any questions about the diet, or my experience, or would like to
share their experience feel free to write me at 100760.1110@compuserve.com
(Deborah A. Dowd).<BR><BR>Thanks for &quot;listening.&quot; I hope your search
for health is a rewarding one!<BR><BR>Take care,<BR>

<BR><BR> [Found in the IBD and IBS and UC page]<BR><BR>If you've tried the
Gottschall diet from her book BREAKING THE VICIOUS 
CYCLE, I'd love to hear from you. I've have followed this diet for Crohn's 
disease and IBS, and I have found that it makes a significant difference 
in some of my symptoms. It doesn't work for everyone, but the diet is a 
reasonable one and quite balanced. You need to give it a good 3 week try 
to see if it works. It really has helped with my cramping, spasms and 
frequency of &quot;D&quot; . . . when I stick to it!<BR>

[Anonymous letter forwarded to me]<BR><BR>I have been on the Gottschall diet for
more than 7 months. All my symptoms 
have disappeared except the gas. After only 3 - 4 months you will see this diet 
working. While your husband's diarrhea is active you should stay away from 
nuts, raw fruits and veggies and avoid a lot of honey. <BR><BR>You have to stick
to the diet for 1.5 -2 years. <BR>

Here is testimony from the net that this diet works. GOOD LUCK.<BR>

Dear Elaine Gottschall, <BR><BR>Thank you again for your reply to my questions.
My daughter T. suffered from stomach discomfort and frequent prolonged bouts of
diarrhea for over 4 years. Each time we visited our doctor he said it was
probably &quot;beaver fever.&quot; He would collected specimens and although the
results were always negative, he would prescribe Flagyl. This helped temporarily,
sometimes quite dramatically, but the pain and diarrhea always returned.
<BR><BR>Last year I changed doctors and went to Vancouver Children's Hospital.
There they performed an Endoscopy and Colonoscopy on T. as well as taking
Biopsies. The tests showed changes in the duodenal area indicative of
Illeitis/Crohn's disease. The doctors felt it would not be necessary to use
medication. In addition they said it was unnecessary to change her diet except
for taking her off milk. I should note that at the time of her tests she was
relatively well and had only mild diarrhea. They wanted to see her again in 1
year. <BR><BR>I heard about your book from a sister-in-law who has Ulcerative
Colitis. Unfortunately she found the book after her colon was removed. Two of my
husband's cousins also have Colitis. I started T. on the diet in November and the
improvement has been very noticeable. She has been free of diarrhea for one month
and only experienced discomfort once, which may not have been CD
related.<BR><BR>I hope this answers you questions about her diagnosis. Thank you
for your persistence in telling people about the diet. It really made a
difference.<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR>

V.B.<BR><BR><BR>

Dear Ms. Mobley,<BR><BR>Our son P. was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in April
1993, near the end of his senior year in high school. He was put on
sulfasalazine. However, after two months he continued having diarrhea, pain,
weight loss, and weakness. We were then lucky enough to receive information from
a friend about the book &quot;Food and the Gut Reaction&quot; by Elaine
Gottschall, B.A., M.Sc. The book details a dietary program that has helped many
people in combating Crohn's. The dietary program is informed in part by Mrs.
Gottschall's two decades of research and teaching in Cell Sciences, Anatomy, and
Human Biology.<BR><BR>P. started the diet in June 1993. Within one week, he
exhibited more energy. In three weeks he had neither diarrhea nor pain. He has
now been off all medication for nine months and feels great.<BR><BR>We noticed in
reading &quot;Profiles in Research&quot; that there is no mention of research on
dietary or holistic approaches to managing Crohn's. Is CCFA doing or supporting
any such research? In particular, has CCFA investigated the diet proposed by Mrs.
Gottschall? Her updated book, &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health
Through Diet,&quot; has just been released from the publisher and is now
available.<BR><BR>We have contributed regularly to CCFA and our local Indiana

<BR><BR>Dear Elaine,<BR><BR>Your book has been a tremendous help for my daughter.
After starting your diet 14 months ago, she has stayed symptom free. The diet has
also helped a number of other people with various digestive problems whom I have
seen in my practice.<BR><BR>I recently heard of a French doctor who is conducting
interesting clinical research. For example he has found that certain
old-fashioned grains which have not been genetically manipulated (such as
sarrasin and epautre) do not cause Crohn's reactions.<BR><BR>I would like to
order three copies of your new book &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; for
which I will pay you with a US$ check.<BR><BR>
Again thank you for your pioneering work.<BR><BR>S.K.<BR><BR>[The same person

my daughter so she can give you first hand information. The diet has made a great
difference in her life. She follows it strictly but uses a great deal of
creativity. Originally her gastro-nterologist, aware of &quot;alternative
approaches,&quot; suggested the diet. <BR><BR>I am a non-PhD psychologist who
specializes in psychosomatic difficulties. I have found Elaine's theoretical
concepts about Crohn's and diet most helpful. However, not all cases of Crohn's
are the same. My daughter went on the diet the second year after her symptoms had
started. At this point she had not been given the full range of classical medical
treatments and this I believe made a positive difference. <BR><BR>Her brother who
has suffered from years of &quot;on and off&quot; ulcerative colitis became worse
while he was on a three month test of the diet. I am not sure if he followed the
diet as strictly as his sister and it seemed that the high cheese protein was not
good for him. He now follows a modified type of the diet which allows some of
cereals. <BR><BR>I will include a copy my some of my ideas about CD/UC that I
wrote a few years ago. I believe the heavy use of antibiotics, frozen foods and
ice cold drinks assist intestinal breakdown and the 
&quot;running wild&quot; of the immunity system.<BR><BR>&lt;&lt; Crohn's disease
is a wicked, gnawing horror to anyone living with it. It is an illness that
attacks the basic beliefs and knowledge of modern allopathic medicine which treat
it as a digestive problem rather than the sign of an immunity problem. My theory
is that the kidney, spleen and liver become overloaded and can no longer do their
job. As a result, the gut becomes a highly selective excretion organ instead of
an absorption organ. This is a reaction, or wisdom, of the body that keeps us
alive and functioning.<BR><BR>Unfortunately medicine in the U.S. and in Europe
(Belgium has the highest per capita rate of Crohn's in the world) cannot view CD
as an immune problem because this becomes an attack of the basic belief that
organ systems, to a great degree, function independently). In Europe the
traditional treatment is not any better. However, homeopaths, acupuncturists, and
naturopaths are better trained and can keep people from surgery.<BR><BR>My
daughter, who lives in Reston, VA, improved incredibly by using the a diet (the
Haas Specific Carbohydrate Diet). The diet was suggested by a NY nutritionist.
Basically, the diet eliminates anything that can produces toxins which trigger
the immunity system.&gt;&gt;
<BR><BR>Good luck in passing the word to those who can be helped, especially as
one sees how the ignorant and greedy medical system butchers innocent people's
lives.<BR><BR>S.

<BR><BR>Nov. 5, 1995<BR><BR>Dear Mrs. Gottschall,<BR><BR>You may not remember me
but I started your diet six months ago (May 1, 1995) and spoke to you several
times. At that time, you graciously faxed me an interesting article regarding my
spondylitis.<BR><BR>In these past six months, I've had three minor bleeds of
short duration in these past 6 months which in itself has been a minor miracle.
I've been feeling great and last Friday I had my yearly colonoscopy. I expected
good news but was startled by my gastroenterologist's report: Aside from scar
tissue (I don't think &quot;scar&quot; was the term he used, but that was the
implication), my colon currently looks like that of a healthy 18 year old. In
fact I'm 49 years old and after a long history of GI problems I was diagnosed
with ulcerative colitis at the age of 41.<BR><BR>I had no intention of even
trying the diet when I first read it--it was the opposite of the diet suggested
by my Doctor. I truly believed it would put me in the hospital. However, by a
stroke of divine intervention ( I am not a religious person), as I fearfully put
your book down, I received a phone call from a cousin who knew someone with
Crohn's. This person had recently gone on a &quot;gluten&quot; free diet. I
immediately called this stranger and listened to a tale of miraculous
remission.<BR><BR>Sadly, it was sadly your daughter's illness that inspired you
to write this book. But I believe it has been a bright light of information and a
source of hope to scores of others, like myself, who have been seeking relief
from and knowledge of this debilitating disease. Thank you from the bottom of my
heart.<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR>

Date: Wed, 29 Mar 1995 19:10:08 GMT<BR><BR>I had an extremely GOOD experience
with homeopathic medicine,
particularly with a certain diet I discovered in a book called &quot;Food and
the Gut Reaction.&quot; I had been extremely ill with Crohn's for five years
and was at the end of my rope. The pain was constant and my hair began
falling out from malnourishment. While visiting my grandmother in
Canada, my mom came across the Food and the Gut Reaction book. Within one
month on the diet my pain was gone. In another three months, all my symptoms 
disappeared. I followed the diet for a year and a half. I now eat what I
want and have been Crohn's &quot;free&quot; for about two years. If this diet
helped me, it can help anybody. I've referred several other people to
the book and they've all had great results. Although the diet is very strict and
 tough to stick with, it is definitely worth it. <BR><BR>It forbids grains, most
dairy products, and sugar. The author clearly explains the
details of the diet as well as the scientific basis behind it. My doctor
basically told me it was bullshit, but he can't explain why it was so
effective for me and for others. It sure can't hurt to try it. It's a
lot less damaging to your body then all those steroids. The name of the
book is &quot;Food and the Gut Reaction&quot; by Elaine Gottschall. It's printed
by
the Kirkton Press in Ontario, Canada. The address is as follows:<BR><BR><BR>

Date: 3 Feb 1995 16:31:00 GMT<BR><BR>Hope for those of you who suffer and are
looking for solutions!
Here is the testimony on my son's battle with Crohn's. This
testimony was part of a letter I wrote to Elaine Gottschall, the author of the
book
entitled &quot;Food and Your Gut Reaction.&quot; The book is now reprinted under
a new
title, &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; (Kirkton Press, Kirkton, Ontario,
Canada).<BR><BR>Excerpts from letter to Elaine Gottschall :<BR><BR>&quot;P. was
born on September 6, 1976. For the first 15 years
his life was active and fulfilled.. Other than hay fever in
the early summer months, P. had been relatively healthy.
But in the Fall of 1991 we noticed a drastic change in
his eating habits, energy level, motivation, and weight. His
condition became worse every day and although repeated visits to
P.'s pediatrician yielded no results, we persisted. In the spring
of 1992, we obtained a referral to a specialist .<BR><BR>In May 1992, P. was
diagnosed with Crohn's disease and 
referred to a relatively new gastroenterologist at the Children's
 Hospital of Eastern Ontario. As his condition deteriorated, P.
was given medications such as Mesasal, Asacol, and prednisone.
Prescribed to relieve the inflammation, these drugs generated 
other side effects. The only dietary recommendations were
 to stay away from high fiber type foods such as broccoli, carrots,
 cauliflower, nuts, etc. At this point, we talked to a 
number of people about Crohn's disease and read as many articles as we
could find. All were very pessimistic, recommending
to learn to accept that this disease is for life and that there
is no known cure other than drugs and occasional surgery.
 The future did not look promising for P. We were all very
discouraged.<BR><BR>P.'s condition continued to deteriorate through the fall of
1992. In December 1992 P.'s new gastroenterologist,
informed us that P.'s condition was critical. His body
was not responding to the drugs and upon our return from our
Christmas holidays, we would have to seriously consider one of
two options for P.: adopting an elemental diet regime (via feeding tube)
or surgery. We were all shocked and distraught by the news.<BR><BR>However, since
learning of P.'s condition, my sister-in-law, who 
has a keen interest in preventive medicine, began researching Crohn's
disease. She discovered a number of articles and publications including the book
&quot;Food
and the Gut Reaction.&quot; She believed the diet was worth
considering and we had nothing to lose. P.'s condition was at 
its worse but the testimonies in the book gave us
some motivation and hope of a potential recovery for P.'s
suffering.<BR><BR>P., my wife and I all read the book. Although we 
carefully followed the recommendations in the book, for 
the next three weeks P. still suffered episodes of intestinal pain. 
But our patience and persistence paid off. P.'s pain started to 
dissipate and his condition improved dramatically over the next few
weeks.<BR><BR>Our son has now been on the diet for two years and we
are happy to report that his gastroenterologist confirmed that
there is no sign of the disease in his system. He has 
gained weight and grown approximately six inches. He is extremely active--
 playing tennis and hockey, cycling, going to school, and holding down a part
time job.
He has applied for university next fall. He has always been 
interested in nature and science and aspires for a career in
biotechnology.<BR><BR>We want to share our experience with others
and I am presently attempting to establish links with newsgroups on
the Internet. Over the past two year, we have promoted your book and the
diet through friends, relatives and co-workers. There seems to be 
a person in everybody's life who is afflicted with this
&quot;problem.&quot;<BR><BR>We hope this information proves useful to you.

<BR><BR>Dear Elaine, May 15, 1995<BR><BR>Thank you for your letter of April 27 in
response to mine of April 17, 1995.
This past Saturday I purchased your new book &quot;Breaking the Vicious
Cycle&quot; from Barnes and Noble in Massapequa, Long Island, New York, The
clerks in the store told me was in great demand.
I gave the book to my daughter who has had intestinal trouble for ten years.
Prior to giving her this new book, I gave her a copy of your Food and the Gut
Reaction. She followed your advice for just one week and she felt a hundred
percent better. Her problem had ceased. She plans to follow your advice for a
long time to come to make sure she stays well.<BR>

Thank you for this wonderful miracle.<BR><BR>J.M.K.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR>

To: Ish Narula 72053,3212<BR><BR>Hello Ish,<BR><BR>I am on the diet. I had
Crohn's diagnosed about 10 years ago and have had 3
surgeries since, the most recent 3 years ago. I experienced 
varying amounts of pain (sometimes severe) and had diarrhea almost all the
time. I've been on prednisone, sulfa, 6-MP, Flagyl, and a host of other meds
at one time or another.<BR><BR>I've been on the diet almost 3 months now. I'm
hoping it will cure me of
this dreaded dis-ease. At 3 weeks, the diarrhea stopped and has not returned.
At about 8 weeks the pain started to noticeably lessen. Three months ago I
was in constant pain. Today, pain is the exception. While the it is not
gone, it is significantly reduced in intensity and frequency. And, I continue
to improve. <BR><BR>Elaine is a wonderful woman. I've talked to her on the phone
several times.
 She is home in the evening and is happy to discuss any specific questions.
<BR><BR>Officially, I would check with your doctor before changing anything in
your 
lifestyle. However, in my experience, MDs are not interested in cures for
Crohn's.
 My GI doctor simply stated &quot;There is no scientific evidence that this diet
will help.&quot;
 Of course, he didn't know any details about the diet and showed no interest in
looking at
the book I had brought. However, he is right. There is no &quot;scientific&quot;
evidence
this will work. But then, I don't particularly care about scientific
evidence--my interest is selfish. I simply want something that will
cure me of Crohn's and I believe this will do it!<BR><BR>By all means, stay on
the meds your doctor has prescribed. As the diet begins
to cure you, work with your doctor to reduce and eliminate the meds. 
I've discussed this diet with several nutritionists and they also don't seem
interested. But there is at least one doctor in New York that will support you
 in this effort. There might be others.<BR><BR>I am currently involved in an IBD
support group that is corresponding via CIS
E-MAIL. There are about a dozen people in the group and 4 or 5 are currently
on the diet. You are welcome to join us--just let me know.<BR><BR>Do yourself a
favor and try the diet for 30 days. After that, you can
re-evaluate your options and make a decision. Personally, I will remember
this year and this diet as the time when I found the cure. Maybe the doctors
don't believe it and of course there are other skeptics, but that's their
problem not mine. For most people, it becomes a journey where you will return
to health.<BR><BR>Let us know what you decide.<BR><BR>Regards, Kevin<BR><BR><BR>

To: Ish Narula 72053,3212<BR><BR>Hello Ish,<BR><BR>&gt;&gt; My only concern right
now is will I lose any weight after starting on<BR>

&gt;&gt; this diet?<BR><BR>Actually, I did. However, I needed to. I am 5'8&quot;
and started out at nearly 195
lbs. When I started the diet, I lost several pounds a week. Worried, I called
and asked Elaine about it. From her experience she finds that people with 
chronic diarrhea are often overweight. She has also observed that with her 
diet, overweight people tend to lose and underweight people tend to gain. 
For the last month my weight has stabilized at 175 pounds which is closer 
to what I should weigh.<BR><BR>In addition my pulse and blood pressure both
dropped by nearly 25%.
I'm not sure if this was a result of the diet, the weight loss, or both. 
My resting pulse is about 65 and my blood pressure is 95/60.<BR><BR>I talk to
Elaine regularly, the last time being earlier this week. She
doesn't have any modifications to her diet or suggestions, but she has written
an updated version of her book. It contains a couple of extra chapters and 
additional recipes. It is titled &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle&quot; and is
ISBN #
0-9692768-1-8. Although I don't have the book, I understand it can be
purchased through Walden Books, B. Dalton Books, Borders Books, and Barnes &amp;

To: Ish Narula 72053,3212<BR><BR>Hello Ish,<BR><BR>I assume you have the book.
The phone number listed in the back as the
address of the publisher is actually Elaine's home number. I'd suggest
calling her to discuss the specifics. She is home in the evening and I'm 
sure she would love to talk to you. I've called her several
times. Be aware, she talks very fast. Get ready to write quickly or 
even record the conversation. She will give you a wealth of info in a very
short time.<BR><BR>As I understand it, a relapse is normal. After close to three
months on the
diet, I had a significant relapse which lasted about 2 weeks. Are you following
the 
diet very strictly? I understand that even a little bit of cheating can
potentially cause trouble.
Strictly speaking, NOTHING processed may be eaten. ONLY those things
specifically mentioned in the book should be consumed. It can be tough.
Nothing out of a can or jar. Nothing made in a factory. It is also important
to eat a variety of foods and pay close attention to the spiritual and
emotional aspects of your life. I know this may sound silly, but after 10
years of searching, this is the one that is going to cure me of this
dis-ease.<BR><BR>I am doing very well with no Crohn's symptoms and I hope to
continue.<BR><BR>Also, I recommend that you discuss the situation and the diet
with your
personal physician. Unfortunately, he will probably dismiss the diet without
a second thought. I spent many years in self-diagnosis and I know how tough
it is. On the other hand, I think I did a much better job with my body than
my MD was capable of.<BR><BR>Keep me posted. Let me know how I can help. If you
would like to talk, I can<BR><BR>EMAIL my phone number too.<BR><BR>Regards,

&quot;fan&quot; letter to you about the Food and the Gut Reaction book.<BR><BR>My
20 year old daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in December of last year.
We were fortunate in the sense that it only took two months to
diagnose.<BR><BR>She was put on a series of different medications, prednisone
being the main one. As long as she was on that she was fine eating everything.
However, as the prednisone was cut back, her symptoms returned.<BR><BR>In April
of this year she decided to try your Specific Carbohydrate diet. She has been
fanatical about it since April 27. Now she has no pain and is doing very
well.<BR><BR>The doctors remain skeptical. She also takes Imuran and her
specialist believe that is responsible for he good health. He told her to stay on
the diet, but that it didn't make much of a difference.<BR><BR>I want to talk to
people who have followed the diet for a number of years and introduced some of
the &quot;illegal&quot; carbohydrates back into their lives. How can I do that? I
wrote a letter to the Toronto Star asking for input, but they never published
it.<BR><BR>I wonder if you get many letters like this and if there any new
developments as far as this diet is concerned. We have a great time experimenting
with the recipes and finding new things that she can eat. A support group for
sharing ideas would be extremely helpful since The Crohn's Foundation does not
recognize this diet as beneficial. Is there more support in the London
area?<BR><BR>God bless you and the work you have done. I wish more people would
try this diet approach. <BR><BR>Yours truly,<BR><BR>J.Y.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>Dear Elaine,<BR>
I hope that it's all right for me to call you Elaine. I feel as though I know you
-- perhaps because we have a common aim in life: to help our children and others'
children who have IBD.<BR>
Thank you for sending me a copy of your book even though I did not send enough
money! It's easy to see that you're not interested in money--you're more
interested in helping others!<BR><BR>Patrick has been trying some of the recipes,
and the cramps in his stomach are gone. Over the weekend he went to the toilet
only twice and he can &quot;pass wind' now without anything happening!!!
He has been studying the book and his wife, Y., has been doing a bit of cooking. 
His whole attitude to life has changed. Instead of saying, &quot;I'm 28 years old
and I'm finished!&quot; he now smiles more and doesn't bite my nose off when
asked a question!<BR>
I'm enclosing 10 dollars to compensate for your bother. I hope to keep in touch
with you and give a progress report every so often! I also know that I can turn
to you when I need advice.<BR>
I really have been praying that my son could be made well and I think the Lord is

<BR><BR>Dear Ms. Gottschall,<BR>
I was sick with diagnosed ulcerative colitis over seven years ago. For over five
years, I suffered from severe pains, cramps, chronic diarrhea and severe
bleeding. Over four years of treatment by medical doctor and a period of
hospitalization provided no relief for my problem.<BR><BR>My son saw your
interview on the Dini Petty Show, so I ordered your book and started your
(specific carbohydrate) diet on March 1, 1991. Within six months I felt much
better. There was no bleeding, less gas and relief of severe stomach and bowel
pain. Now, a year and a half later, I am continuing the diet and feeling much
better.<BR><BR>I recommended your book to others I know with this problem. I wish
I could let more people know how helpful this book has been in getting me back to
health and a full life.<BR>

<BR><BR>October 18, 1995<BR><BR>Dear Elaine,<BR>
Thank you for the discussion we had this evening.<BR>
I am a 67 year old male and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in the spring of
1994. I was fortunate enough to see the Getting Healthy TV program in the fall of
1994 and purchased your book as soon as I could locate a copy. I started the diet
on October 18, 1994 and now I am completely free of any symptoms. Initially, I
thought it would be difficult to stay on the diet when I went out to eat, but I
have always been able to find things on the menu or have the restaurant
accommodate me. (For example, substituting potatoes or rice for more
vegetables.)<BR><BR>I purchased additional copies of &quot;Breaking The Vicious
Cycle.&quot; I sent one to a friend in the Netherlands and gave another copy to
my gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist kept making excuses for not reading
the book until I said I wouldn't keep my next appointment until he read the book.
After looking at the book, he said &quot;the diet can't do any
harm.&quot;<BR><BR>After the original diagnosis the doctor prescribed ASACOL. I
am now down to 3 400mg tablets a day, which, as you stated, the doctor probably
believes is responsible for the remission.<BR><BR>Once again, thanks for the
helpful comments.<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

Crohn's develop food intolerance. Much research has been done in Cambridge,
England. In particular, for the past 15 years, Dr. John Hunter has used diet as a
means of controlling Crohn's disease with an extremely high success rate for
people with Crohn's in the small intestine. (It is more difficult to control the
disease if it is located in the colon or large intestine.) DO NOT listen to the
medical opinion that Crohn's disease and food are not related. Diet does not work
for everyone, but it sure as hell is easier to try adjusting your eating habits
then letting the disease continue. Controlling the symptoms with medication never
allows the intestines to
heal.<BR><BR>&quot;/Fanmail/IBDSucksArticles/DietforCrohnsDisease&quot;

Dear Ms. Gottschall,<BR><BR>I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 1968. Since then I've
had two operations and eight other hospitalizations because of this disease.
Recently, I was hospitalized again and told I'd need another operation in the
future. A &quot;narrowing&quot; of a portion of my intestines was also
discovered.<BR><BR>I have read and reread your wonderful book. I am now in my
third week of your diet and can't believe the difference in my life. No pain or
discomfort, less bloating, no nausea and no more hours on the &quot;royal
throne.&quot;<BR><BR>**While following this diet, will the &quot;narrowing&quot;
disappear? Completely? Will this narrowing ever widen  
without surgery?<BR>
**I can't find dry curd. I live in Central New Jersey. I've unsuccessfully called
eleven establishments. The dairy managers have never heard of dry curd. When told
that Beatrice has it in Canada -- they all called said -- No! Not here in the
States!<BR><BR>I WILL DRIVE INTO NEW YORK for the dry curd. PLEASE TELL ME WHERE
I CAN GET IT. PLEASE.<BR><BR>Thank you so much for your terrific book and for
taking the time to answer my questions.<BR><BR>Take care and STAY
WELL<BR><BR>D.C.<BR><BR>P.S. I haven't eaten a salad in thirty (30) years. IT WAS
DELICIOUS! (Of course I used oil and vinegar)<BR><BR><BR>

October 17, 1994<BR><BR>Dear Ms. Gottschall:<BR><BR>I wrote to you earlier this
year and received a warm letter in return. To freshen your memory, I was
diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 1982 and since then have had six surgeries. I
have only four feet of each intestine remaining. Earlier this year I was placed
on a temporary feeding tube and faced the possibility of a permanent one.
Instead, I decided to try your diet. I started the Specific Carbohydrate Diet on
September 1, 1994. I have never felt better in my life.<BR><BR>At last my weight
is up and stable. I have no pain and I can exercise again. I feel like a new
person. My twin sister is also on the diet. I have told everyone who will listen
about your diet and your book. I recently ordered the new edition of your book as
well.<BR><BR>I am enclosing a letter I wrote to a columnist regarding a letter
she received from a reader. I want to tell the WHOLE WORLD about the diet. If I
can experience these results then ANYONE can. The only individuals who do not
support my diet are the gastroenterologists who would rather treat me with
steroids and chemotherapy. Don't get me wrong, when I need a doctor, I'll go. But
for now, I am sticking religiously to my diet.<BR><BR>I can't thank you
enough.<BR><BR>In case you missed them, I have also enclosed several articles
from The Saturday Evening Post.<BR><BR>Thank you again,
C.K.<BR><BR><BR>

Subject: <B>Gottschall Diet</B><BR>
Date: Mon, 10 Apr 95 05:41:56 GMT<BR><BR>Hi,<BR>
Just one minor point. I believe the book says if the diet is going to be
effective, 
the person will show significant improvement in the first month. I'm acquainted 
with about a dozen people who have been using the diet for various lengths of
time,
 all with positive results. Many of the group are symptom free. However, the
length 
of time takes to get rid of the symptoms is highly individual. It depends a lot <BR>
1) on how well you follow the diet (and it can be *tough*), <BR>
2) how bad/extensive the disease is when you start it--for those who are 
 nearly obstructed, she [Elaine] says it may be too late to avoid
surgery.<BR><BR>With all the people I personally know, the diarrhea, inflammation
and cramps 
have stopped somewhere between three weeks and four months. Also, after being
on the diet for 4-6 months, a person usually has a brief relapse lasting from 3
to 7 days.<BR><BR>Whatever you decide <BR>Good Luck,<BR>

<BR><BR>October 19, 1995<BR><BR>Dear Elaine,<BR>
This letter is from C. S. of Saskatchewan. I phoned into the CBC Radio Show on
October 13, 1995 when you were a guest in Regina. You asked if I would write to
you. I often felt like I should write and thank you for your book Food and the
Gut Reaction. It was a great help in overcoming ulcerative colitis but sometimes
I feel shy about writing letters. By the way, I was pleased to win your book in
the draw that day.<BR><BR>I recommended your book, Food and the Gut Reaction, to
many other people who heard about my success and phoned me to ask what I did to
solve my problem. I have heard back from some people saying that they are much
improved. I am absolutely convinced that if anyone doesn't have a lot of
improvement it's because he or she hasn't followed your suggestions closely
enough. It is very difficult for some people to change their eating habits and
stick to a rigid diet.<BR><BR>I suppose that I should give you a little history
of my own experience. In the late 80's I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.
The doctor said that they rate the seriousness of ulcerative colitis on a scale
of 1-5 and I was a 4. The pills he gave me did not help. I'm not sure of the
spelling but I believe they were Asacal and Sulfasalizine. I was told by the
doctor (specialist) that I could eat anything but I doubted his advice. I read
everything I could get my hands on about my condition. One day when I went to see
the specialist, I brought a whole page of questions about diet and nutrition.
When I started asking these questions, he became very defensive and said that
people who wrote these books were illiterate. That day I left his office, flushed
his pills down the toilet, and went on my own diet. I had some success but then I
read your book Food and the Gut Reaction. In one week on the SCD I was improving.
The second week I was much better and by the third week I knew ! 
There was no turning back. <BR><BR>My only problem was that I was eating a lot of
raw fruit. In the fall of 1989 I had a setback. I was really confused. The blood
showed up again, so my family doctor sent me to a different specialist. I was
desperate so I agreed to let him put me on steroids. (By the way, my own family
doctor has been quite supportive of my experimenting with the diet-- he admitted
he couldn't help much with diet for colitis but said if what I was doing was
working to keep doing it). Finally, a good friend of mine was in a health food
store in Calgary and picked up an article that was written by a Doctor Delmar
Gibbons who had colitis himself. He also wrote a book called The Self Help Way to
Treat Colitis and Other IBS Conditions. He said that too much fructose was not
good for people with colitis. As a result, I cut all fruit out of my diet and in
one week I was getting better again. I was still on your diet and I went to the
specialist and asked if he would take me off the steroids!<BR><BR>He disagreed
but helped me ease off them anyway. The last day I left his office, he said to
me, &quot;You will be back in six months.&quot; That was 5 years ago. By
religiously sticking to your diet and not eating too much raw fruit, I managed to
gain 30 lbs in two years. Getting back the weight I had lost made me feel like a
new man.<BR><BR>I feel I am a good example of someone who has often had poor
advice from doctors and decided to go out and take responsibility for my own
health. It has taken a few years to educate myself to the point where I feel as
though I have some control over my health. Maybe I had a few things going for me
to start with. I have never been a drinker or smoker. I don't consider myself
religious, but I think that I'm a very spiritual person who was lucky to have had
parents who set a pretty good example for me to follow. With the experience that
I've gone through, I feel that there is a real need for a place like a Health
Center where people can go to get proper information about diet and nutrition and
some guidance to help them live a healthier life style. When I am at the grocery
store, I cannot help notice what people have in their shopping carts. No wonder
we have an epidemic of people with gastro-intestinal problems. I notice the
number of obese people. Men (with their big stomachs),!
 women (with their big behinds) and kids overweight and out of shape. People are
getting sick and going to doctors. They are not always getting good information
and ending up in hospitals. It is breaking our Medicare system and no one seems
to be getting at the root of the problem. By the teaching of prevention of
illness through proper diet and lifestyle, many such cases would be
avoided.<BR><BR>Here comes my big plan: I am hoping to walk the length of
Saskatchewan, from north to south (approx. 800 miles). I would walk with 3 other
30 year olds as a team. No one has ever done this before. There are no roads for
the first 90 miles so we would have to start in March when the lakes and rivers
are still frozen. We would have to be accompanied by a snowmobile train for a few
days. I think the entire trek would take approximately 40 days. Hopefully we will
get enough sponsors to raise enough funds to start some kind of a health center.
So. MAYBE. SOMEDAY. MAYBE. The projected trek would take place in spring of '97
or '98.<BR><BR>Changing the subject a little: I am sending you a gift copy of my
own book on Stackwall Construction, as well as a pamphlet on our Bed and
Breakfast in Costa Rica. My wife J. and I are half owners of the property. Our
partners have a business in Vanscoy, so Jackie and I spend four months in Costa
Rica operating the Bed &amp; Breakfast (usually from Dec. 1-April 1). While in
Saskatchewan, we live on a small farm (160 acres). My brother farms our land. We
also have four acres of Saskatoon berries (organically grown) where J. and I
spend a lot of time.<BR><BR>Love,
C<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>#: 293302 S1/General Discussion<BR>
21-Aug-94 21:18:08<BR>
Sb: #293171-Crohn's Disease<BR><BR>Thank you for your e-mail. I am always
impressed when I see a loved one
involved in the health of someone with this disease. My husband has been very
beneficial to me. I can not tell you how much he has done to keep the mood
up.<BR><BR>Although the diet itself has granted health to a great many people, a
good
inner sense of self is vital. Keep up the good work.<BR><BR>Anyway, about the
diet, you need to purchase a book, it was written by Elaine
Gottschall, a woman in Canada. Her four year old daughter was very sick at one
time so she took her to a doctor that was recommended to her. He put her on
this diet and in a year or two she was well. She has never experienced any
other symptoms and is now in her forties with a house full of kids! This diet
had such a profound affect on her daughter that Elaine has dedicated her life
to research and helping others. Another gentleman who is a member of our
discussion group has been cured for 17 years.<BR><BR>Although it doesn't work for
everyone, there have been so many positive
results that I feel the need to offer it whenever and wherever I can. There
is no MAGIC CURE of course. I have been on this diet myself for a month now,
along with a couple other members in our discussion group. We support each
other in this endeavor. So far I have had a good response. The cramping and
flatulence are gone and my BM's are down to 3-4 a day as opposed to 7-9 a
day.<BR><BR>
I don't get paid for offering this diet to others, I just know how much
EVERYONE would like to be well. Most MD's do not recognize this diet as valid,
and give a cold reception to the idea that the answers for some can be so
simple. By the way, after your wife achieves health again she can start to eat
some of the other foods again, in moderation. It's nice to know that once we
establish wellness we can eat the yummy foods, although I plan to go very easy
on the stuff that has no real food value. I found the diet to be reasonable
and not bad at all.<BR><BR>Here's the book info, the name of the book is
&quot;Food &amp; The Gut Reaction&quot;, by
Elaine Gottschall, Kirkton Press. If you can not find it at your neighborhood
bookstore have them order it for you from the Baker &amp; Taylor
warehouse.<BR><BR>Please let me know if you or your wife would like to join our
Crohn's
Discussion Group. Not everyone in the group is on the diet, but we all either
have Crohn's or have loved ones who do.
Keep in touch!<BR><BR>The Very Best Of Luck To You,
C<BR><BR>[Same person wrote this letter to Elaine]<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>Feb. 7, 1995<BR><BR>Dear Elaine,<BR><BR>I wanted to take a moment to
thank you for your book &quot;Breaking the Vicious Cycle.&quot; The diet outlined
in the book has helped me so much. I have Crohn's Disease which caused me to
experience pain and constant diarrhea for 21 years before I started the diet.
After a few weeks on the diet I noticed a change. The pain slowly disappeared. A
few months later the diarrhea began to disappear, and now after 6 months I have
normal bowel movements most of the time and NO pain or cramping whatsoever. No
medication or surgery has EVER given me this kind of healing!<BR><BR>For the
first time I can look forward to the future, a future that does not include
endless doctor visits, medical tests, and dangerous medications that do not help.
Before starting the diet I had been on prednisone for 3 years. As a result my
adrenal glands shut down, and when the prednisone dose was lowered, the symptoms
would return. This cycle went on and on. The residual diet my doctors put me on
did not help. As a result of your diet I was able to taper off the prednisone
without a flare up of symptoms.<BR><BR>My husband, who has been endlessly patient
through all of this is enthusiastic too. He can see the sparkle in my eye, the
color in my cheeks, and the ready smile on my face, He too, has a new vision of
our future, as he has a healthy wife he never knew before. Instead of holding my
hand through the days I couldn't get out of bed or hearing my cries from the
bathroom, he is happily planning a hiking vacation this summer! Something that I
could never do before, as I always needed to be near a bathroom. <BR><BR>One
gentleman I know is also on the diet and now can manage his kids' hockey and
baseball games and return to University, while holding down a full time job! He
now has an opportunity to move on with his life. His five children are seeing a
happy father they never knew.<BR><BR>Another gentleman, who just started the diet
spoke of the possibility of being able to golf now. It won't make his handicap
any better but he can play the whole game without worrying about getting to the
bathroom in time!<BR><BR>Thanks again for writing the book and for your countless
consultations, I owe you a debt of gratitude that I may not be able to repay in
full. You gave me back my life. Please let me know if there is anything I can do
for you.<BR><BR>Fondest Regards,
C.M.<BR><BR>

        <BR><BR>
Hello Everyone,<BR><BR>I have had ulcerative colitis for over twenty years,
proctitis actually. Just the last 7 inches of My colon were diseased. 
Late 94 I had a scope done and it showed the usual 7 inches. 
About two months ago, a flare up I had been having for about 2 years started to
get much worse. I was running to the toilet many times and I had the blood and
such. I went to a new GI and had a scope done and found that the colitis had
spread to the entire colon and that I now had severe colitis. What a shock that
was. I was started on steroids, Imuran and increased Asacol. Nothing was helping.
One night about a week after the scope, I felt that I had better get to the
hospital. I went and was admitted right away. I had a blood infection and had to
be rushed to another hospital after three days. I was in so much pain I wanted it
to stop or die. I have had two kids and always thought childbirth was painful,
but this was much worse. At Rochester hospital I developed a fistula and was
having bowel movements through my vagina. (I'm sorry, I know this is gross). 
After a blood transfusion I was rushed into surgery. I now have an illeostomy. I
do not know how long it will take to get used to having this. I get depressed at
times and strange as it sounds I grieve for my lost colon. A very nice thing is I
no longer have to run to the toilet all day and night. I eat what everyone else
eats. I only have to cook my fruits and vegetables. The main problem is self
image. With the fistula and ostomy intimacy is difficult but I know with time
this will work out. When I had the surgery, the doctor left two inches of my
rectum in case it would heal and one day I could have the reconnection surgery.
It still feels like I have to have bowel movements and the doctor says this will
happen until the rectum heals. 
I followed the SCD diet for many months and although it seemed to help for a
short time I quickly got worse. I know that we all want to heal from these damn
diseases but I just want to encourage everyone to please be careful! I almost
died from the perforation of my bowel. I was never very sick, just had the
proctitis for so long. Keep doctor visits and watch your symptoms carefully. 
If the diet does not work for you, DO NOT FEEL GUILTY !! 
I sure did. I am very glad that the diet helps so many people. Very, very glad
that some people are healing. I just do not want anyone to get sicker or worse
because they waited to seek medical care or stopped medicines. I know this is a
long note. I wish everyone well! If anyone else on the list has an ostomy or
anyone had a fistula like what I have please e-mail me directly as I am no longer
on the SCD list. <BR>

Take Care Everyone and (early) Happy Holidays!<BR><BR>Anna (New York)
