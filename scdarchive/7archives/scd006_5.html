Jonas:<BR>
Leukocytes is just a fancy word for white blood cells. They are the cells<BR>
of the immune system and are responsible for any inflammation. So I guess<BR>
something that reduces the number of leukocytes in the colon is good for<BR>
people with IBD.<BR>
And it was interesting the point you made about that protein in milk. I<BR>
would think that it would also be present in yogurt and may partly explain<BR>
why some people find yogurt so helpful. <BR>
It also concerns me about the bacteria thriving on iron. I am currently<BR>
taking iron supplements because I have had a lot of bleeding lately, but
I<BR>
am beginning to wonder if that is a good idea.<BR>
I have noticed any problems with strawberries myself. They are pretty high<BR>
in fiber but I don't know if this would be causing you any problems.<BR>
<BR>
Benito:<BR>
I know you mentioned at one time that Elaine feels iron supplements are
bad.<BR>
Do you happen to know why that is?<BR>
<BR>
Athena:<BR>
I think the rule for the amount of protein we need is 0.8g for ever kilogram<BR>
of body weight. Just in case you don't know, to convert from pounds to<BR>
kilograms just divde by 2.2. This value from what I understand is for a<BR>
normal healthy person. I would imagine that someone with IBD would need<BR>
more protein because the body is trying to heal itself and repair damaged<BR>
tissue.<BR>

Welcome to the group. I was just wondering how long you have been on the<BR>
diet, and for how long you have been symptom free. I also have UC and<BR>
although the diet has helped me considerably (I am in my fourth month on
the<BR>
diet) I am currently going through a flare up that has lasted over 3 weeks.<BR>
I also noticed that you mentioned the book &quot;Food and the Gut Reaction&quot;.<BR>
Does this mean you don't have the newer book? It contains some additional<BR>
recipes, including one for bread. If you would like the bread recipe just<BR>
let me know and I will pass it along.<BR>
<BR>
Everyone:<BR>
The CD/UC Home Page has a section for mailing lists and news groups. Maybe<BR>
when we get our listserver working properly, we should consider having our<BR>
group listed here.<BR>

Take care,<BR>

Hi bill,<BR>
<BR>
I had the rep from Sandoz come over the other day and she reluctantly gave<BR>
me the disclossure of the isosource product. There certainly is a lot of<BR>
stuff in there not on the diet carrageenan - used to deliberately cause<BR>
ulceration in rats. I'm not sure if that was in their top range product,
I<BR>
forget. but certainly the hydrolised corn starch and soy protein are not
on<BR>
the diet. If you wanted one without the soy protein you can get an<BR>
elemental formuola with amino acids only. I've found an interesting<BR>
breakfast alternative that has supplied me with all the calories I need
in<BR>
the morning for breakfast. It sounds a bit weird but I've started having<BR>
HOT juice.<BR>
<BR>
I use the champion juicer which is a fantastic machine that extracts more<BR>
nutrients than any cheap juicer. The waste pulp comes out almost like saw<BR>
dust it's so dry. anyway I recommend this juicer heartily. I've had mine<BR>
for about 10 years no troubles. The juice I make is usally<BR>
<BR>
3 apples<BR>
or<BR>
2 apples 1 pear<BR>
or<BR>
1 pear and a couple of buches of loose grapes<BR>
or<BR>
apple and pineapple<BR>
<BR>
These all taste delicious. They are in harmony with &quot;Fit for life&quot;
(food<BR>
combining principles and since I started cooking the final juice product
in<BR>
the microwave I've had GREATLY reduced problem with gas and bloating. SO<BR>
maybe you could give this a try<BR>
<BR>
I'm tempted to do somthing similar with the vege jhuices but there are a<BR>
number of people who advise against cooking tomatoes and spinach because
of<BR>
the inorganic oxalic acid conversion that causes arthritis (particular<BR>
problem in IBD)<BR>
<BR>
Any way I'll probably be sticking with juices that have a few enzymes in<BR>
them for now rather than the elemental approach although I am thinking of<BR>
an elemental protein suplement only since I'm having a probelm wiht protein<BR>
fermentation. Hear forom you soon,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Subject: Mucus problem<BR>
From: Ben House,ben_house@qm1.mvbms.com,Internet<BR>
<BR>
The discussion of IBD and smoking that went on last week makes me want to
ask<BR>
this question: Does anybody else have a problem with mucus? I've been on
the<BR>
diet 11 weeks now, and although soft or loose stools are a thing of the
past,<BR>
I still have bleeding and mucus (and rectal pain -- usually after going
to<BR>
the bathroom). I've had &quot;accidents&quot; on occasion where I thought
I was going<BR>
to be passing gas and ended up slime-ing my shorts. The number of bowel<BR>
movements I have is way down, but some of them don't even contain fecal<BR>
matter, just tan or bloody mucus (and mucus-smelling gas). <BR>
By the way, the consistency (of the mucus) seems to be changing on the<BR>
diet -- it's much more watery (and splattery).<BR>
I hope I didn't gross anybody out with this post, but if there's any<BR>
group I can talk to about this (personal) matter, it's this one. Since<BR>
everyone's diagnosis is different and everyone's symptoms are different,
I'd<BR>
be interested in knowing if this affects any of you guys. For example, I've<BR>
never had any problems with bloating, but I have gotten a similar kind of<BR>
loud growling that normal hungry people can get, just much lower down the<BR>
trail than the stomach...<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
Ben (NYC)<BR>

<BR>
This is correct: Most orthodox sports nutritionists indicate .8g per day<BR>
for a average person. up to 1.5g for an athlete. Anything more is dangerous<BR>
to your kidneys and bowels.(uric acid) I'm currently on 1.1 and have reason<BR>
to cutback or combine my meals a bit better. (fermentation) If you have
a<BR>
protein digestion problem, the stools will have a foul odour. if you have
a<BR>
carbohydrate digestion problem or if they are normal there will be no real<BR>
odour.<BR>

Dear Ben, Sliming underwear and stooless bloody mucous. Boy does that bring<BR>
back some hurtfull unpleasant memories. For years, I went nowhere without
a<BR>
change of underwear. After a year and a half on the diet, I have to tell
you<BR>
I don't have this experience anymore. In fact it started getting better
on<BR>
the azulphadine and disappeared with the diet. I do still experience<BR>
bloating, especially if I've eaten too much at one sitting. Many small meals<BR>
seem to work best for me. It does sound like your symptons are improving.
How<BR>
long are you on the diet? Are you on an meds? I have UC, do you? Please
keep<BR>
me posted on your progress.<BR>
Dear Matthew, I'm sorry your symptoms are worse since you stopped smoking,<BR>
but you'd better consider carefully before going back. In case my letter
was<BR>
misunderstood, I was not saying that smoking really made me feel better.
I<BR>
was saying that I &quot;used&quot; this study to give in to a desire I had
for a<BR>
cigarrette. There are some things in the study that give me pause, for<BR>
example the bit about the onset on UC following the cessation of the habit,<BR>
which was exactly my experience. I don't really think that going back to
this<BR>
filthy addiction changed my symptoms one way or another but I guess that
the<BR>
only way to find out for sure is to stop again, and I guess I'm not quite<BR>
ready to do that. To buy that stress relief /nervous excitement scenerio,
I'd<BR>
also have to believe that my mind has the power to control my symptoms,
and<BR>
that's one theory I will never believe. I've had this disease for too long,<BR>
been through horendous times with no blood, and joyful times when I couldn't<BR>
get out of the bathroom. In any case, just give serious consideration to
your<BR>
motives before you decide to go back to smoking. Wishing you all good health,<BR>
Rachel<BR>

Well tnx you very some much Tina and hello to all the others in the group.<BR>
Not too sure how I am to access the round robin, so if I am making any<BR>
errors plse correct me. <BR>
<BR>
Nice to meet you Tina, sorry to hear you are having a flare up with your<BR>
U.C.hope you can find the cause of it. Perhaps just a small oversight in<BR>
your diet. Elaine Gottschall spoke of flare ups early into the diet,and<BR>
didnt know the cause, nor the cure. Sometimes it can be the silliest little<BR>
things.<BR>
Cream in my coffee does it for me, in short order. So hang in there on the<BR>
diet, you may well solve your problem sooner than you think. Yes I think
I<BR>
will take you up on that offer for the bread recipe. And no I never bought<BR>
the new book, havent worn the old one out yet. If I can help you with<BR>
anything just give me a shout. <BR>
<BR>
You where disscussing strawberries with someone ealier.I have a question<BR>
regarding both stawberries and rasberries, I have heard the small seed on<BR>
these berries can become lodged in the flutes of the intestines, and<BR>
wondering if this to be a fact. Perhaps someone can help me with that one.<BR>
<BR>
The first attempt at the diet for me was three and ahalf years ago. A few<BR>
errors and afew months later the diet worked wonders for me. I have nothing<BR>
but praise for it. If I had given up on the first try, I would now be able<BR>
to say the diet didnt work for me. Somethings take seem to require more
than<BR>
one attempt. This diet in my opinion is worthy of any number of attempts.
I<BR>
do understand it well may not work for in very instance.<BR>

Hello Deb, tnx for getting bk to me as quickly as you did. You must get

Ben: Mucous seems to be the thing that lasts the longest. I have UC <BR>
and have always found that because stool has formed, that all else has <BR>
passed. Mucuous was always next to the last go for me and then bleeding
<BR>
the last. I have been going through bouts this past week of suddenly <BR>
have gastric symptoms and passing a small amount of liquid diarrhea. <BR>
When I get heavy spasms, I have been passing small amounts of whatever <BR>
that go to the bottom of the bowl and are mostly blood. I am down to <BR>
1-3 heavy bowel episodes in the a.m. Usually at least 2 being with <BR>
stool. I may have 1 or 2 of the other episodes mentioned. I was doing <BR>
well with no activity during the balance of the day and have suddenly <BR>
found myself having the liquid episodes (1-2) during the day. I don't <BR>
know if they are from food or stress. Anyway, I have been very confined
<BR>
for the past 2 months since my recent flare. Limited to being in the <BR>
house, getting to my job and home again. For the first time this past <BR>
Saturday, I ventured, with the aid of my husband in case I had to dump <BR>
everything in his hands and make the 5 alarm dash, out to a couple of <BR>
stores. I have been avoiding that because of the anxiety of &quot;what if&quot;.
<BR>
I made it through a small amount of shopping in a couple of stores <BR>
without incident and was absolutely elated. I picked the time of day my
<BR>
system is the calmest. I told my husband people would think I was a nut
<BR>
if they saw my reaction because I was able to shop in a store. No one <BR>
has any idea what we all go through - no one understands that this goes
<BR>
far beyond a physical thing. Anyway Ben - your issue should pass soon -
<BR>
If not, take a good look at what you have been eating.<BR>
<BR>
I was having trouble with my server and have been able to read but not <BR>
send mail out for the past two days. I guess the SCD server is not <BR>
working and no one has been getting anyones messages. I know some I <BR>
sent out there on the SCD must have gotten lost because I got no <BR>
responses. One question I had asked was why it was okay to use tomato <BR>
juice for pasta sauce. Couldn't you use tomatoes in the can? I thought <BR>
tomatoes acidity was a villan. I know I have to watch how much acidity <BR>
I have in my system. I am Italian and have always used canned tomatoes.
<BR>
When in season, I have made pasta sauce from fresh tomatoes. Can <BR>
someone fill me in on this.<BR>
Anne<BR>

PS - Deb - Thanks for being the go-between for the group while waiting <BR>
for the server<BR>

Dear Deb,<BR>
<BR>
I originally offered to set up the listserver to try and make things easier<BR>
for us not more work. To answer your questions:<BR>
<BR>
&gt;it still needs to work somehow, even if we don't need to<BR>
&gt;subscribe to it as you say.<BR>
<BR>
I intended only to set everyone up on the EXISTING list in one day so as
to<BR>
avoid leaving anyone behind on the old system. Anyone after that will have<BR>
to use the listserver as usual and join up by personally subscribing. (help<BR>
files can be made available)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And, if John's listserver can indeed get the bugs<BR>
&gt;out, do you really think that we need TWO listservers?<BR>
<BR>
No I believe we only need one list server, but John's setup is out of his<BR>
control. It's administered by fwi who are probably charging him money for<BR>
the service. Our listserver is at my office where I can monitor it every<BR>
day.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;The last several messages that you have sent out were mixed up, in that
they<BR>
&gt;included several messages from different people. Is this what you intend
to do<BR>
&gt;with your listserver? If so, is there any way that you could break the<BR>
&gt;messages<BR>
&gt;down to be more clearly defined as being from different people?<BR>
<BR>
When someone wants to send a message to the group, they would send their<BR>
message to scd@filmgraphics.com. Then the list server will forward each<BR>
message individually to each member of the group.<BR>
The author must identify themself with a signature at the bottom of the
body:<BR>
<BR>
eg. Regards Chris (NYC)<BR>
<BR>
Only If someone wants, I believe that there is a DIGEST facility in this<BR>
program that allows an individual to specify a time period over which to<BR>
collect all the mail and send a &quot;bundle of mail all at once&quot; this
means<BR>
they could read their mail all in one message rather than having to deal<BR>
with dozens of messages amidst their other incomming (work) mail. however<BR>
the default is to send mail messages as individual packages.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;John is supposed to be working out the details on what is going wrong
with his<BR>
&gt;listserver. I do like the idea of subscribing, as that takes the pressure
off<BR>
&gt;one person and allows people to access the list via a web site (as<BR>
&gt;suggested) on<BR>
&gt;their own. As it is now, people write to me and want me to &quot;connect&quot;
them with<BR>
&gt;the group. I don't mind doing this, as I can then offer each new person<BR>
&gt;information, but keeping track of the addresses was getting confusing.<BR>
&gt;Not only<BR>
&gt;did I have to make sure I got them all correct for myself, but for each
new<BR>
&gt;person, I had to make sure that the list they got was up to date . .
. not as<BR>
&gt;easy as it sounds.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;How do you propose to keep track of the addresses on your listserver?<BR>
<BR>
The list is stored in a file on the server. I requested the complete<BR>
EXISTING list to initiate this file only. Any SUBSEQUENT subscriptions<BR>
would be handled by the list server using the SUBSCRIBE command and would<BR>
require no intervention by the list manager.The program we have is called<BR>
majordomo which is a very standard and popular program for this<BR>
application.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thank you for your help, Michael. The best idea will be to let the group<BR>
&gt;decide, once we know all the details.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Take Care.<BR>
&gt;Deb<BR>
<BR>
Forward This to the group. we could be up and running within a day as soon<BR>
as I get the full list.<BR>

Hi Ben,<BR>
<BR>
I'm in exactly the same phase as Ann Valinski at the moment. I have been<BR>
having exactly the same bowel motions as her. I also have UC. I look at
it<BR>
on the positive side. Since the mucous means that the bowel walls have<BR>
healed enough to start producing mucous again. but the irritation<BR>
(microbial toxins) is still there signalling the flushing mechanism of the<BR>
bowel. Are you on meds Ben? I'm using the Prednisone enemas at the moment<BR>
and find that they are holding me at this level. before I was on the diet<BR>
they were not working. I'm also considering to start the salazopyin again<BR>
as soon as I get over my flu. Speaking of which, I have been really<BR>
surprised at the way I've been able to escape the worst of this flu (winter<BR>
here) at the momment. I'm taking the chinese scratching therapy at the<BR>
moment and finding that it's doing wonders for the flu. BUT the day after<BR>
my bowels are a mess with diarhea. Then they improve better than before.<BR>
The mucous stage is the hardest for me since I find I get heavy and<BR>
depressed. with a lot of toxic buildup in the body since the bowel is<BR>
starting to work the right way round - absorbing rather than producing<BR>
water in the lumen of the bowel. this means that more mucous and more<BR>
toxins are taken into the body. Water to flush the kidneys Deep breathing<BR>
to oxidate the CO2 acid buildup and any Liver cleansing thing you can think<BR>
of are important adjunctive therapies. Legs and lower back seem to be where<BR>
most of the toxins accumulate with UC and massage and a Bicarb Soda bath<BR>
can really help here.<BR>
<BR>
Anne:<BR>
<BR>
&gt;responses. One question I had asked was why it was okay to use tomato<BR>
&gt;juice for pasta sauce. Couldn't you use tomatoes in the can? I thought<BR>

&gt;I have in my system. I am Italian and have always used canned tomatoes.<BR>

&gt;someone fill me in on this.<BR>
&gt; Anne<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Anne,<BR>
<BR>
I personally only take raw fresh tomatoe juice at the moment since it does<BR>
contribute to a buildup of inorganic acids in the body that lead to pain<BR>
and arthritis. I pop them in the Champion with Spinach Carrot and Green<BR>
pepper (capsicum) for a delicious juice full of vit, minerals and live<BR>
enzymes.<BR>
