Dear Ted,<BR>
Welcome to the list. Hope we can help. If your idea of &quot;cure&quot; is
eventually 
going back to eating everything, I think that that may be out there in the 
future somewhere. For myself, ( diagnosed with UC over 10 years ago) I 
started the diet 2 &amp; 1/2 years ago and have been totally symptom frre for 
over 2 of those years. Recently, I've tried introducing a little of this or 
that and although I don't actually get sick when I do, I don't feel right.<BR>
This diet has worked wonders for a lot of people and although I think it 
involves an extra challange when you have to put a child on this diet 
(birthday parties, playdates, ect.), I think that it could well be worth 
the effort. Lots of good luck.<BR><BR>

Hi Ted,<BR>
My son was recently diagnossed with Crohn's, so I'm am relatively new to<BR>
this too, but if you stay here a short while, you'll see that many people<BR>
have been helped by this diet. I hope that my son will be someday be able<BR>
to eat a few of the things that he can't eat now...even if only<BR>
occasionally. I gather that some people do this and get away with it, some<BR>
say they don't even have a desire to go off the diet, and still others have<BR>
found that they have little luck off the diet. On the subject of cures,<BR>
Elaine Gottschall's daughter was cured of UC in the 60's. Other than that,<BR>
I'm not sure. One thing I do know is that even if Matt (my son) finds that<BR>
he has trouble going off of the diet in the future, my wife and I and the<BR>
folks on this list will have already showed him how doable it really is,<BR>
and he will be able to go back to it no problem. Like any sane parent<BR>
though, I am hoping for the cure for my boy. He is doing great at two and a<BR>
half months. There is work involved in following it, but read up on the<BR>
conventional options (meds, side effects, and surgery), and I bet you'll<BR>
agree that it isn't too much work.<BR>
By the way, the hope of someday maybe being able to eat some of the food he<BR>
gave up has been a pretty good incentive for Matt to stay on the strait and<BR>
narrow. Also, sleeping over at friends' houses and birthday parties can be<BR>
handled as well. Matt has done both. he is now the visitor who comes<BR>
equipped with a kit and a few instructions. There are a number of parents<BR>
on the list who can help out as well. In a summer program he was in this<BR>
year, some of the other kids were really jealous of Matthew's lunches.<BR>
That's another thing that makes things easier: the food is good.<BR>
Good luck to you and your son,<BR>
Steve<BR>

<BR>
Could you please tell me more about Elaine's diet because when I signed
up for this forum I asked Benito if he could tell me something about this
diet and I haven't heard anything.<BR>
<BR>
thanks<BR>

Hi Vicki,<BR>
<BR>
First of all, this is not a &quot;forum&quot; in the same sense as the CompuServe
forums.<BR>
It is an e-mail support group.
<BR>
Basically, &quot;Elaine's diet&quot; is the Specific Carb Diet. I'm on it
for my Crohn's<BR>
disease. I've been on it since October 1995 and at that time, I was seriously<BR>
ill. The doctor wanted to prescribe prednisone for me, but when I saw the
diet<BR>
being discussed in the Natural Medicine Forum of CompuServe, I asked the
doctor<BR>
to give me one month to try it before putting me on steroids (which I'm
very<BR>
afraid of, after hearing so many &quot;horror&quot; stories).<BR>
<BR>
The diet is outlined in the book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle, by Elaine<BR>
Gottschall. The intention of the diet is to exclude all foods that are not<BR>
monosaccharides, and therefore, help the digestive tract to heal. The foods
to<BR>
avoid are all grains (including corn and rice), all lactose (natural cheeses
and<BR>
homemade yogurt are okay, though, as the lactose is removed), all refined
sugar<BR>
(including corn syrup and molasses -- instead we use honey, fruit or
saccharin<BR>
as sweeteners), and potatoes. (It's been so long since I've written a list
of<BR>
&quot;illegals&quot; that I may have missed something, sorry.)<BR>
<BR>
Since so many foods are outlawed, we are forced into being creative with
our<BR>
diets -- that's why having a support group is so valuable. Also, when we
feel<BR>
the urge to cheat, we have others to turn to and let us know that it just
isn't<BR>
worth it. The diet has to be followed 100% to be effective -- and if it
works<BR>
for you, you will know usually within a month. For me, I've avoided steroids,<BR>
gotten off azulfidine, avoided a second surgery and now have more energy
than I<BR>
had ever thought possible. The energy is the most amazing thing to me. Other<BR>
people in our group are more enthusiastic about no longer bleeding, no longer<BR>
being near a bathroom, etc, etc, but for me, I'm most excited that I now
have a<BR>
REAL life! I have never been as independent as I am now. My husband is away
to<BR>
Germany for six weeks (he's got four weeks left there) and I am coping like
a<BR>
normal person! I'm even letting my kids have sleepovers and we are going
places<BR>
and I'm not having to call social services for an aide! My kids are 7, 6
and 3<BR>
and are quite active, as you can imagine -- their friends seem even more
so,<BR>
maybe because they haven't been brought up having to respect a sick parent
as my<BR>
children have been. <BR>
<BR>
But, now, my kids also have the chance to be normal kids and not have to
fend<BR>
for themselves as much as they have had to in the past. . . sometimes I
thought<BR>
of myself as an alcoholic mother -- you know, the kind that you see on TV
with<BR>
the hangover and the kids are pouring their own cereal and getting dressed
on<BR>
their own while their mother is moaning and groaning in the background.
Except,<BR>
for me, I was groaning from the bathroom. They invariably got into an
argument<BR>
when I was having bad diarrhea and unable to leave the toilet. I would weep
at<BR>
how helpless I was as a parent. It was very depressing.<BR>
<BR>
I don't know what your current situation is, but if you have any form of
IBD or<BR>
IBS, I would recommend finding the book (get it from the library and there
will<BR>
be no money spent) and trying the diet for a month. It can't hurt to try,
but<BR>
if it works, it will be such a good feeling!<BR>
<BR>
Take care,<BR>
Deb<BR>

Hi Deborah and Vicki,<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps Deborah whilst at the tail end of the diet may be introducing 
normal foods again has introduced potatoes into her diet, but initially 
potatoes(white or sweet), yams, parsnips are not allowed either. There are
a 
few veges that are high in easily digestible complex carbohydrates that 
should be included as part of the diet also since they help your energy
to 
last:-<BR>
<BR>
Swede's(Rutagabas) and turnips, pumpkin and squash, green peas (if you can 
tolerate the skins, they have more energy than potatoes per 100g), Zuchini 
and other summer and winter squah and carrots.<BR>
<BR>
I've experienced a substantial increase in energy and that means calories 
for those trying to pu on weight, since adding at least three of these 
veges to my lunch and dinner!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Regards,<BR>
<BR>
Michael<BR>

&gt; Side effects of either irritable bowel syndrome or ulcerative colitis -
two<BR>
&gt; doctors have given different diagnosis!  Vertigo; <BR></FONT>
<BR>
I've had the vertigo.  No fun!  As with everything else, mine improves<BR>
as my gut heals more and more.  That one takes patience.  Sometime even<BR>
when I'm not getting diarhea from a food, some still make me more tired<BR>
than others.  Do others find this as well?<BR>

<BR>
I believe that cooked stuff will be easier to tolerate.  Don't rush it<BR>
if you think something will bother you.  I find it easier to introduce<BR>
something new when I am feeling good and strong.  It's better to wait<BR>
and feel healthy than have variety to eat but feel bad! (another humble<BR>
opinion of mine!)<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt; Food intolerance - Finding I am still quite limited in vegetables I can<BR>

&gt; and even then, get gas and sometimes cramping.  Does this change?<BR>
<BR></FONT>
In my experience, it does change, will change.  Has for me.  For<BR>
example, I can eat apples now.  But peaches and figs make me feel tired<BR>
and spacey.  Haven't tried bananas.  Almonds bother me but not pecans or<BR>
cashews.  Go figure!  :)  But in the beginning, I couldn't eat apples.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt; Fatigue - Find I have to eat more often than 3x a day as I now have no<BR>
&gt; energy reserves since being on the diet!  Anyone else have this?  I used
to<BR>
&gt; be able to go to the gym and have a mild workout, but since being on the<BR>
&gt; diet, have not been once -- have to conserve my energy for work, cooking<BR>
&gt; this diet, etc.<BR></FONT>
<BR>
I felt like that during the first few months of the diet.  It can be<BR>
different things (of course) but first and foremost is that it takes a<BR>
lot more calories to heal the body than to just maintain it.  So make<BR>
sure you really are getting enough food for yourself.  When I first<BR>
started the diet I found I could eat four times as much as I did<BR>
before.  In fact, if I didn't, I felt like I was starving. I'd be<BR>
curious about other's experience with this one.<BR>

&gt; Exercise - what do people are on the diet do?<BR></FONT>

For me, I just stick to walks.  Sometimes fast, sometimes slow.  But<BR>
walking is what I do most consistentley.  I used to run, practice<BR>
martial arts, yoga, cycling.  But now I am happy to have the energy to<BR>
just get through the day.  I find that my energy level stays pretty<BR>
consistent, will go donw if I've eat something that irrititates my gut<BR>
or if I've eaten too much.  This one does get better!<BR>

&gt; Weight Loss - I have lost about 10 pounds since being on the diet (2
mos)<BR>

5'3&quot; and this is<BR>
&gt; maybe a part of my fatigue.  Maybe my body is still adjusting to change
in<BR>
&gt; diet, no exercise, etc.  Has anyone else lost quite a bit of weight with<BR>
&gt; this diet?<BR></FONT>
<BR>
I lost weight but then it leveled out again.  Try to eat,eat, eat!  Eat<BR>
higher calorie foods like avocado if you can handle it.  Eat the skin of<BR>
the chicken, etc.  It takes practice, but you can get enough calories on<BR>
this diet, so don't think weight loss is a given.<BR>
<BR>

&gt; I have had to start eating fish and chicken...my body is craving it,

&gt; 25 years of being a vegetarian!<BR></FONT>
<BR>
I had that too.  It wasn't that I was a vegetarian, but, man, can I pack<BR>
the protein foods away these days!  I figure my body is craving them for<BR>
a reason, most likely repair of damaged tissue (yay!).<BR>
<BR>
Regarding Progesterone, I for one was on natural progesterone for two<BR>
years!  So I have a little understanding of it.  Out of curiosity, which<BR>
pharmacy produces the natural progesterone you are on?  Mine was<BR>
ApotheCure out of Dallas, Texas.  (I could give you their phone number<BR>
if you want it.)  I used to take capsules, then switched to a sublingual<BR>
(under the tongue) liquid.  By the way, I am off of it now, weened<BR>
myself off slowly since last November and stopped this June.  My need<BR>
for it decreased as my gut healed.  <BR>
<BR>
I don't know about the starch in it, but perhaps you could get a<BR>
sublingual liquid like I did.  I am fairly sure there is no starch in<BR>
it.  However, regarding the wild yam extract -- I personally would not<BR>
worry about the starch factor as it is doubtful that any remains.  They<BR>
must break it down to the actual chemicals of progesterone so it is no<BR>
longer &quot;starch.&quot;  But the filler they use in the capsules, I'm not
sure<BR>
about that.  Anyway, for what it's worth, those are my humble opinions<BR>
on the progesterone!<BR>
<BR>
I did not notice an aggravation in symptoms while I was on the<BR>
progesterone.  But everyone is different.<BR>
<BR>
Hope these experiences of mine as well as the humble opinions help you<BR>
out.  Don't be afraid of asking too many questions.  This is the place<BR>
for them!  Glad you made it to the list!  <BR>

<BR></FONT>
Increase in appetite is a definite *side-effect* of any diet<BR>
like SCD.  The increase shows that (IMHO) your stomach size increases<BR>
to accept more food coming in, since everything is so easy to digest.<BR>
In a previous diet I was on, this was certainly true as much as<BR>
being on the SCD now.  At that time I was able to eat a whole <BR>
chicken, piles of mashed potatoes, and veggies all in one sitting.<BR>
<BR>
Rignt now I tell others that I can eat like a pig (allowable SCD<BR>
foods of course), and not gain weight (although I really want to).<BR>
<BR>
In any case, I find 3 meals and 3 snacks per day works well.  By<BR>
experimenting, meals include one of hamburger/fish/chicken (eaten<BR>
first for better digestion by stomach acid), soup, cheesecake,<BR>
veggie.  Snacks include 1/4 cup yogurt muffin, cookies, and jello<BR>
(grape gelatin). I try to avoid drinking water during meals in<BR>
order not to dilute stomach acid, only taking as much as required<BR>
to take my pills/vitamins.  Most vitamins are taken after meals<BR>
so that they sit on top and have time to break down properly.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps someone.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks... Dan.<BR>

&gt; if anyone knows if any formal studies have been done to see<BR>

According to Elaine Gottschall, if I remember correctly that is, 95% of<BR>
people with CD are helped and 75% of those with UC.  I'm sure the<BR>
percentage would be even higher if everyone who had parasites (a problem<BR>

establishment) got rid of them, in addition to going on the diet.<BR>

To: SCD-list@longisland.com<BR>
Subject: <B>Re: Candida vs. Bacteria/Honey Consumption<BR></B>

<P>I wasn't going to write this until I'm sure that I'm on the right
track but here goes (I hope I don't have to eat my words - there's
not much else I can eat at the moment! :) ) Anyway, I've been sick
for about 3 1/2 years with extreme weight loss, sickness, nausea,
unable to eat anything sweet including all fruit, and not much
carbohydrate or large amounts of food.  For the last few months have
been afraid to eat hardly anything, as my bowel and stomach have
such a bad reaction. I've been cutting right down on carbohydrates
and mainly having vegie juices, and getting pretty weak.


<P>I went to a new gastroenterologist a couple of months ago, who
recently performed a colonoscopy (my 4th I think, first time with
him).  I haven't had the result back yet, but he also made an
appointment for me at the Allergy Clinic which is attached to one of
our main teaching hospitals.  It was free, so I figured I'd humour
him and go along for the ride, as I couldn't convince him my problem
was parasites and/or yeast (both of which have been diagnosed) which
has resulted in colitis.  I went there three days ago, and the
interview lasted just over 3 hours. I was tested for allergies (skin
prick test), which came up zilch.  Then I saw a doctor, who took my
medical history. Lastly I saw a very knowledgeable dietician (to my
ears anyway!). The longer I sat there listening, the more upright I
sat in my seat. Suddenly I felt renewed hope for orthodox medical
practice!  I haven't read Elaine's book, but judging by what some
people are eating/not eating on this list, I imagine it's something
similar to what she talks about (or maybe not). 


<P>The clinic told me about how all food contains chemicals and can be
divided up into three main food groups - ie. Salicylates, Amines and
Glutamines, and how some people react against these chemicals and
they call this &quot;intolerance&quot; (as opposed to
&quot;allergy&quot;).  Every food
has varying amounts of these chemicals, ranging from low, to
moderate, to very high.  These intolerances can be very severe, and
debilitating in some people, and occasionally require
hospitalisation.  Other people get through life just feeling unwell
and have varying degrees of diarrohea/constipation etc and feel not
quite right, and others sail through life and eat all they like
without any effect!  I felt quite happy with this explanation, and
glad they weren't going to tell me that I was making it all up!! and
it was only a touch of irritable bowel or some other rubbish.
Anyway, I came away loaded up with explanatory books, a food diary to
keep for 2 to six weeks, &amp; diets with yummy sweet foods in(!).  I
thought, well if I eat half this stuff I'm going to end up in
hospital!  I was a bit hesitant, but it didn't take me long to try
out the rice flour pancakes with golden syrup or the Golden Carob
Roll, not to mention the soup with more carbohydrates than I'd had in
a week!  I went to bed the first night thinking I wasn't going to be
able to get out of the bloody thing the next day!  I had nightmares
about plane crashes and being lost in fog....but woke up the next day
feeling fine, just a slight headache, nothing like I was expecting.
Couldn't believe it. Apart from constipation, no reaction from my
stomach or bowel, two parts of my body I would rather not be so
intimately acquainted with!


<P>Apparently, all sugar has chemicals in it, but the sugars with the
lowest chemical makeup, is golden syrup, maple syrup, and white
sugar. Honey is very high in natural chemicals, along with all jams,
fruit flavourings, chocolate, mints, peppermints, and lemon butter.
In the moderate range is molasses and raw sugar. Apparently because
white sugar is refined it's had most of the chemicals removed.  All
fruit varies in its chemical makeup and ranges from low, moderate,
high to very high. Lowest are pears (ripe and peeled - lots of
salicylate in the rind) and is the only fruit permitted in initial
stages of the diet. This approach ranges over a wide variety of
vegies as well.  Now I understood why I would eat some things which
were ok for me but combined with food which weren't ok and made me
feel ill, so I would put all those foods on the prohibited list.


<P>Meanwhile physically I feel fairly good, and emotionally I feel over
the moon.  Of course tomorrow's another story, but if I can get
through to the middle of next week without a flare I know this is my
problem, and my search will be over!  If not it'll be a double dose
of anti-depressants and a straight-jacket - I'll keep you all
posted.

Christiane,<BR>
Feel free to ask any and all SCD questions on this list.  That's what we're
here for!<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt;Won't I be weak if I don't eat carbo like bread, pasta, etc?  Finally,<BR>
&gt;my job requires a lot of entertaining ( lunches and dinners with<BR>
&gt;clients) :  how can I eat in restaurant and still respect the diet?<BR><BR>
</FONT>

In MY experience, I wasn't weak from not eating carbs, but I WAS extremely
hungry all the time.  This hunger problem went away after 3-4 weeks on the
diet, and before that, the only thing I could do was try to load up on any
allowable carbs such as squashes and carrots.  I had to eat way more of the
other foods than I normally would (such as eggs, meats, fish, poultry,
cheeses, yogurt, and fruit) in order to keep from feeling hungry. Do you
feel weak at all right now?  Weakness can be attributed to the disease
itself (overall malaise), as well as anemia from blood loss (even if you
can't see it), and maybe even medications.<BR><BR>

The key with this diet is GRADUAL introduction of the allowables.  A big
mistake a lot of newcomers make is jumping in too fast and eating beans, raw
fruits and vegies, and nut flour baked goods before their gut is ready.  The
book explains that you should begin with the introductory foods only and
then, as symptoms diminish, add more of the allowables.  Some foods are
easier to digest than others.  For example, well cooked fruits and vegies
without the skin or seeds is usually more tolerable than raw or crisp cooked
vegies.<BR><BR>

As far as restaurants go, it is POSSIBLE to eat out without making too much
of a scene.  I found that it's best to go to a Grill type restaurant.  Know
your restaurants ahead of time, and be the one to pick where to go.  If you
know what is on the menu, there will be no guesswork.  I found a few
restaurants where I knew I could find things to eat on the menu, and I stuck
to those restaurants only.  At one chain restaurant called Earl's (in my
neck of the woods), they always have steamed or grilled fish, sauteed shrimp
with garlic and butter, and steamed or grilled vegies.  I ask for my vegies
to be very well cooked, not al dente.  Sometimes you have to stress this
point with the server.  Often I will say &quot;hold the potatoes&quot; or if I
don't
feel like it, I'll just get what comes with it and then not eat the things I
can't have.  <BR><BR>

When I advanced on the diet to being able to eat raw vegies, I could always
order salads, with oil and vinegar dressing on the side and no croutons.  I
would avoid any menu choices with sauces because they tend to have starches
or sugars added.  At one place where I couldn't find anything suitable on
the menu, I created something by ordering a grilled chicken burger that came
with lettuce and tomato and asked them to &quot;hold the bun&quot;.  It was a
really
nice plain grilled chicken breast on the plate with the lettuce and tomato.
<BR><BR>

If in doubt, ask if they marinate the meat in anything.  Usually steak is a
good bet because most restaurants don't put anything on them.  There's
nothing wrong with asking the server questions, and if they are not sure,
having them check with the kitchen.  These things can be asked in a tactful
manner so as not to seem fussy.  These days, many people have food
allergies, so if anyone questions why you aren't eating something, and if
you don't want to go into a discussion about your illness, you can simply
say &quot;food allergies&quot; and people will tend to accept that excuse.  
<BR><BR>
You can even have a glass of dry wine now and then.  Personally, I like to
mix water in when no-one is looking.  Herbal tea with lemon and honey is a
standard beverage I usually order, or just water.  Breakfast is easy: steak
and eggs or bacon and eggs, hold the toast and hashbrowns.  If you are
forced to go somewhere where there is really nothing you can have, then eat
ahead of time at home (or bring food to work), and just order a dinner salad
to pick at.  When people ask why you aren't eating much, say that you had a
big breakfast or lunch and aren't that hungry right now.  So as you can see,
there are ways around everything, and when you feel better and don't have to
go to the bathroom as much, it will be all worth while.
<BR><BR>
We have many tips and pointers to offer on this list.  So, keep thinking
about it, and ask away.<BR><BR>

My wife and I eat out in the order of three or four times a week. I am
however in remission, near full time on the diet. I can cheat to a small
degree on sugar, but stay completely away from the starch.I have no
intentions of ever trying it again.  The SCD has become a &quot;Normal&quot; diet
for
me, and I no longer  not find it inconvienent.<BR>
In the restaurants I simply take the attitude that asking for what I want is
not a crime.<BR>
So it is &quot;Hold the toast, hashbrowns, and the gravey.&quot;
I believe the easiest meal for anyone on this diet is the smorg. Because of
the greater selection of meats veggies, and friut, it much simplier to avoid
the foods we can not digest.<BR>

Hi Jennifer,<BR>
The key to eating out in a chinese restaurant is making sure they Eliminate
all<BR>
cornstarch, soy and sugar. This restaurant I eat at uses fresh made stock for
the<BR>
food preparation either fish, beef, chicken stock. This is important to know
but<BR>
restaurants won't always reveal. Commercially pre-made powdered stock mixes
is<BR>
industry standerd at most less expensive resturants. They all  contain soy
protein or<BR>
cornstarch.  Btw, I know this stuff cause my husband was in the restaurant
business.<BR>
<BR>
In my neighborhood they have these dishes already on the menu under &quot;special
diet&quot; .<BR>
It's basically wok stir fried food with sesame oil. I eat saut&Egrave;ed Chinese
eggplant<BR>
with garlic, Shrimp or beef with broccoli, Lemon or orange flavored chicken.
The<BR>
orange and lemon is dried peels saut&Egrave;ed with hot Chinese peppers and
sesame oil. I<BR>
also eat steamed Chinese veggie's.<BR>
<BR>
I don't eat snow peas because i haven't figured out if they are okay on scd, and
i<BR>
definitely don't eat the water chestnuts.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>

Dear Christiane,<BR><BR>


Like yourself, I have to &quot;do lunch&quot; with business partners and
customers 
and it can be a bit worrying - the temptation is strong to cheat with a 
sauce or potato or two!  I've found a few things help:<BR><BR>


1. Order salads a lot (with the dressing on the side) and pick items off 
the menu that are stand alone (for want of a better phrase) like steak 
with vegetables on the side, chicken with vegetables, etc.  Deserts are 
tricky, but go for cheese if you can, or skip desert altogether.<BR><BR>


2. Drinking with the meal is no problem - if you feel the others feel 
like drinking wine, you can order a dry one, or stick to mineral water - 
its perfectly acceptable these days.<BR><BR>


3. If there is little you can eat on the menu, then mention you're on a 
diet. This allows you to eat less (without making the others feel 
awkward) and is also something which I've found a lot of people have an 
interest in (&quot;I've tried a diet before&quot;, my wife's on a diet&quot;,
&quot;I lost 
14 pounds in 3 months&quot;, etc.) and can be a good conversation topic in 
these sort of situations.  Obviously, don't tell them that the diet is 
for a medical problem as then the conversation gets onto guts and 
diarrhoea which is not a good mealtime topic, but maybe say it is a new 
eastern diet or something.  It really is surprising how much interest 
people have in dieting.<BR><BR>


Don't let the dining out problem put you off the diet - remember, it is 
your health that is most important.  It's not much use having good 
business contacts if you're too ill to meet with them.  Set yourself the 
goal of sticking to the diet and you'll be amazed how good you feel when 
you negotiate a dining out experience without straying from the allowed 
foods.<BR><BR>

My husband has Crohn's disease and has been on the SCD diet quite successfully
for two years. He, too, must entertain clients at lunch and had reservations
about how to manage. In addition to the suggestions you've already gotten,
here's another one: he chose several good restaurants in his area, and spoke
to the owner or manager to explain his situation. Now he tries to always go to
one of these places, where he is greeted as a good customer, asks for his
usual order, and doesn't have to explain very much.<BR><BR>

Good luck-the diet is fairly difficult to start, but has been well worth if
for him.<BR><BR>

Subject: <B>Re: Entertaining and SCD</B><BR><BR>

I also take clients and employees out for meals and have been on the SCD since
last summer.  It hasn't been any big problem.  It's easiest when I get to have
some input on selecting the restaurant--I usually avoid Italian and Chinese,
and prefer steak houses or other restaurants with pretty mainstream
selections.  I order steak, grilled fish, or roast chicken.  I avoid marinated
meat/fish/chicken.  I often inquire directly and explicitly whether there is
any flour, breading, or sauce with the food if there seems to be any chance of
that.  I ask that no croutons be put on my salad and request oil and vinegar
dressing.  I ask what the veggie is that day and usually just get extra
veggies instead of rice or whatever starch they are serving.  As far as an
explanation, I merely explain to the server upfront that I have a number of
severe food allergies--particularly to flour--and therefore I have to be
careful about what I eat.  This has proven to be the best course of action for
me.  If they think I'm just trying to eat a low-calorie diet, they won't work
as hard at it.  With the fear that I might have some unknown &quot;reaction&quot;
in the
middle of their restaurant, they are highly motivated to be careful and will
often volunteer extra details that can prove helpful. (I point out the flour
issue explicitly because I have an intense reaction to it and it is an
ingredient that can be included in a meal in a lot of ways)  I also find that
the &quot;food allergies&quot; approach goes over fine with prospective customers
and
people like talking about the topic of what people can be allergic to.  It's
close enough to the truth that it's an easy conversation.  I also find that it
avoids the others feeling self conscious.  If they think I'm &quot;being
good&quot; on a
low calorie diet then they might feel awkward about what they order if they
think they could use to lose a few pounds too!  In general, I've found that
most people have some specifics that they ask for with regard to their meals
and most people, in a business setting, don't ask for details unless they are
offered.<BR><BR>

One of my favorite treats is to go a great french place in my neighborhood and
get chateaubriand with bernaise sauce (or grilled salmon with bernaise, or
filet minon with bernaise...you get the idea.)  Bernaise sauce is thickened
with egg yolks and generally would only contain ingredients which are fine on
SCD.  In my case, I verified the ingredients with the chef at this place to
ensure that I wouldn't get surprised.  I believe Hollandaise Sauce is in the
same category, but I would verify that they make it themselves from fresh
ingredients and that the ingredients are what you expect--then enjoy!  For
those who are great cooks or married to one, you might want to explore these
at home.<BR><BR>

Oh...and I ask for fresh berries for my dessert.<BR><BR>

 Chinese restaurant coat their meat with starch before they cook it. THANK
 YOU very much for making me aware of this!  My husband and I have been
 eating at one particular Chinese restaurant for over six months now, and
 every time we go (about once every two weeks) I order plain steamed chicken
 with broccoli. After reading your post, I tested the chicken with iodine and
 sure enough it turned black. The worst part is, I've been cheating all of
 this time and I didn't even know it :

<BR>I've had the most success at a certain kosher roasted-chicken
 restaurant.  They have rotisseried chickens which they *promise* have
 nothing on them but paprika (after I make sure to impress upon them
 that if I eat so much as one molecule of sugar or starch I will keel
 over in the middle of their restaurant, gasping for a phone to call my
 lawyer...).  They also have Israeli salad (a mixture of diced
 cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and peppers in nothing but fresh lemon
 juice), and fresh fruit salad made of nothing but cut-up citrus
 segments and melons.  I feel like I'm having a feast when I eat there,
 even when the rest of my family is partaking of their all-you-can-eat
 carbo-loaded extravaganza (fried chicken, rice, pasta, muffins,
 etc.)...

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>For those of us who try to maintain busy work schedules and do all the
 cooking related to this diet quick meals are a must.  Here are some of my
 successful ideas.
<BR>
<BR>
 I make large batches of the crunchy almond chicken nuggets from Deborah
 Dowd's receipe list.  I freeze them in single serving bags and whenever I
 just don't want to cook or am in a hurry they are great with honey mustard
 sauce or plain.
<BR>
<BR>
 Lunches:  I eat soup almost every day.  It can be made in large batches and
 frozen or refridgerated.
<BR>
<BR>
 Tuna and chicken salad are great with a sliced tomato.  Pickles and lots of
 olives go well with this (olives are great for calories as well).
<BR>
<BR>
 For those who can't eat honey this won't help, but monster cookies are
 delicious and travel well.
<BR>
<BR>
 Cinnamon raisin bread is great with peanut, and probably any other type of
 nut butter.
<BR>
<BR>
 I make a couple of dessert things every weekend as well. Usually a
 cheesecake and something else.  My best Christmas gift was a ice cream
 maker which I use to make wonderful batches of honey sweetened vanilla and
 peppermint ice cream with all cream. I eat lots of it - talk about
 calories.  
<BR>
<BR>
 Who can complain about a diet on which I get to eat ice cream and
 cheesecake on a daily basis??  Life is good.
<BR>
<BR>
 Now if I could only get a few more hours in every day...
<BR>
<BR>
 Oh - nut butters of all types are also great on celery sticks.  I don't eat
 raw vegies at the moment, but this is a snack I've eaten all my life.

&gt; <BR>
&gt; Also, are sorghum &amp; or cane syrup permitted? How about lactose free
milk<BR>

&gt; <BR>

My diagnosis is IBS--lots of gas, bloating, diarreah, and costipation. <BR>
I asked myself the same questions you did concerning the food.  I was<BR>
&quot;starch queen.&quot;  I kept every meal &quot;blah&quot; meaning, mac and
cheese,<BR>
potatoes, bread,etc... No veggies, salad, nuts, etc...  The first 2<BR>
weeks of the SCD were fairly &quot;loose&quot; for my bowels, but I stuck with
it<BR>
and after 1 month the SCD foods did not bother me.  I began to enjoy<BR>
veggies, salads, fruits--things that tore me up before SCD.  As the I<BR>
progressed with the diet, there were and still are certain foods that<BR>
caused me to be WAY TOO GASSY!  I got so discouraged, but through trial<BR>
and error I eventually discovered what did and did not set well.  This<BR>
diet has totally changed my life for the better.  I am a new person. <BR>
You could ask my friends and family--they would reccommend this diet to<BR>
you in a heartbeat!  It is work to stick firmly to the diet, but the<BR>
rewards are so worth it.  You won't regret it.  <BR>
<BR>
Initially, I spent all my weekends cooking as well as my evenings, but<BR>
you quickly get the swing of it.  You learn how long things will last. <BR>
You can double and triple recipes and you can get your cooking down to a<BR>
science.  Don't be discouraged.<BR>

<BR>
The early &quot;days&quot; of the diet can be frought with so many &quot;what
ifs&quot;, &quot;what'<BR>
causing this ...&quot; One thing is that many have to be prepared to measure<BR>
improvement in possibly months not days and weeks as we did.  Further, keep<BR>
in mind the early  part of the book wherein, Elaine puts the GI condition<BR>
pre diet into true perspective.  Your gut is in turmoil, any little thing<BR>
internal and external is going to affect you in some way, but keep on, you<BR>
will get over it.  Do not be quick to discount the various foods because<BR>
they may appear as being problematic.<BR>
<BR>
Your body is trying to fight back.  One way is how Elaine discusses the<BR>
build up of mucous, it is a protective action by the body, it is also a<BR>
double edged sword in that you cannot absorb much through it.  So along<BR>
comes food that is going to, in the long run, eliminate the food source for<BR>
the pesky bacteria that has &quot;squatted&quot; and taken over where you once
had<BR>
friendly bacteria.  This whole &quot;eviction&quot; process takes time and in
the<BR>
interim you have to eat.  Quite frankly, in the early stages of our daugter<BR>
being on the diet it seemed everything caused a problem.  You will get over<BR>
over it and the reversal will take place if you are prepared to be<BR>
fanatical.  This diet is not like weight watchers where a few months on and<BR>
an  odd week off will bring results.  This diet in a very powerful yet non<BR>
intrusive way changes the chemical and biological picture of your gut.  That<BR>
all takes time.<BR>
<BR>
Also, because of the probable poor condition of your nutritional levels, you<BR>
can become a breeding ground for a host of other problems, candida, prone to<BR>
parasitic invasions, home of other wonderful microbes and prone to aches,<BR>
nausea, poor eyesight, the list goes on.  These will pass, do not worry<BR>
excessively about them.  With each mouthful of the food on the SCD you are<BR>
reversing all that action.<BR>

A few things I might suggest to help a newcomer.<BR>
1. If you can manage it safely, fast for about 1-2 days before starting<BR>
the diet.<BR>
2. Drink a huge amount of good clean (not tap) water, a gallon or more a<BR>
day.<BR>
3. Exercise. Take a short walk about 30 minutes after eating. I also<BR>
find swimming helps.<BR>
4. Be careful that the foods you are getting are actually OK, ie.<BR>
organic, not premade (may have added sugar, etc.)<BR>
5. Try to &quot;Eat right&quot; That is, chew well, eat slowly, don't drink
water<BR>
until after the meal, cool, but not cold foods are best. Eat proteins<BR>
first, then veggies and if fruit at all, last and at least 15 minutes<BR>
after the rest of the food. Some also suggest not mixing fruits. ie. eat<BR>
strawberries only, and then an hout l;ater eat melon and so on.<BR>

&gt; Hi, I am a newly diagnosed patient of Crohn's disease.<BR>
&gt; I'm on steroids and another anti-inflammatory drug.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I'd like to hear from other patients of Crohn's about<BR>
&gt; this &quot;SCD diet&quot; and how it has affected them or if<BR>
&gt; it hasn't, that too. Obviously it seems that some have<BR>
&gt; been affected positively, some have shown no effect.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Secondly, I'm in the USA and am now going to try to<BR>
&gt; get long term DISABILITY INSURANCE. I would like to<BR>
&gt; hear from other people about how to go about applying<BR>
&gt; for DISABILITY INSURANCE once a chronic disease has<BR>
&gt; been diagnosed. Should I hide this fact?<BR>
&gt;<BR>

Hi C. Smith,<BR>
Welcome to the list.<BR>
Having this chronic disease might feel like the end of the world, but<BR>
it's not. Your lucky to find SCD so early on. If you don't already have<BR>
it Buy the book today (Breaking the Vicious Cycle) and follow exactly as<BR>
prescribed by Elaine Gottschall.<BR>
<BR>
Why give up your career and live on long term disability, (unless you<BR>
have a hobby you'd rather do ; )&gt;   first try giving SCD an honest<BR>
chance to work before allowing the drugs and the disease to stop your<BR>
life.<BR>
<BR>
IMO Steroids compound the problems and add horrible side effects on top<BR>
of the disease symptoms. For me the havoc steroids created within my<BR>
mind and body was a 100% worse than the symptoms of the U colitis.. Talk<BR>
about tapering off the steroids asap while seeing results from scd..<BR>
<BR>
You can also find wellness through what you eat and how you live. Now of<BR>
us are different than you. Some were actually much worse off on this<BR>
list and have positive results when carefully following the diet.<BR>
<BR>
Hang in there your not alone :- )<BR>

Soon you'll be able to have a the variety of nuts, dried and fresh fruits<BR>
with<BR>
NO Cooking involved..<BR>
They also make your fridge look beautiful . I put the nuts in zip lock<BR>
bags or jars in the fridge. I bought a beautiful basket for the fridge to<BR>
hold all of them and another basket for  fruit. I also keep a basket of<BR>
fruits ripening on the table.<BR>

I buy a delicious variety of dried fruits without sulfites or sugar at the<BR>
health food store like mango, papaya, cherries, cranberries, pineapple,<BR>

You'll be eating so healthy soon, and once your no longer addicted to<BR>

Hi Folks,<BR>
<BR>
My name's Arnie and I've just signed up on this mailing list. I'm<BR>
thinking of starting this diet to see if it will help out with the<BR>
Crohns Disease that I have. I've ordered the book and will start the<BR>
diet after I've read it. I'd be very interested in hearing from any<BR>
other Crohnies about what degree of help this diet has been to you. If<BR>
this is off topic for the mailing list please e-mail me.<BR>
<BR>
I'd like to ask you folks a few questions.<BR>
<BR>
Do you take your lunch to work with you? <BR>
<BR>
Have you found many restaurants you can eat at?<BR>
<BR>
How difficult have you found it to stay on this diet?<BR>

Hi Arnie -<BR>
<BR>
I've been on the diet for almost a year.  I almost always bring my lunch to<BR>
work.  Usually  restaurants will prepare foods special if there isn't<BR>
anything on the menu that is safe.  I go places with a salid bar, if<BR>
possible.<BR>
<BR>
The diet is difficult for me, because I used to live on all the things that<BR>
are forbidden, but it's worth it!  I was so sick with Crohns that I could<BR>
barely function, and now I hardly know I have it at all.  I feel like this<BR>
diet saved my life.<BR>

Hi Arnie<BR>
My husband Brad has been on the diet for 9 months.  in 1997 he was<BR>
hospitalized 4X with terminal ileum blockages.  He's had crohn's since 88.<BR>
after 3 weeks on the diet he went into remission, only going a few times or<BR>
less, down from 20X a day when he was really sick.  The diet has given him<BR>
his life back.  It is intimidating to get started, and it takes a lot of<BR>
time cooking, but the sacrifices are worth it.  It is a lifestyle change,<BR>
though, unless you can get someone to cook for you and fill your freezer.<BR>
Actually, I'm the one who knocks herself out making his food, but its good<BR>
to have a husband who has enough energy to play with and take care of our<BR>
baby daughter!  We haven't tried a lot of restaurants, but Brad eats out a<BR>
lot, often taking just the banana cake with him.  He's on the road right now<BR>
and all he's taken with him is the banana cake.  We find Red Lobster is<BR>
pretty accommodating.  Some places have buffets.  Good luck on trying the<BR>
diet.  What part of canada are you in?  Oh yes, Brad doesn't find sticking<BR>
to the diet very hard, because he fears the wrath of Alison if he cheats!<BR>
After 21 days anything becomes a habit, and Brad only rarely misses his<BR>
previous favorite foods.<BR>

Processed foods have none of their own intricate nutritional value left after

manufacturers having a legal allowable amount to how much non food bug pieces

Subject: <B>Why No Canned</B><BR>
<BR>
Michelle and those asking why Elaine says no canned food:<BR>
<BR>
There's an excellent explanation from her on the web site, the specific<BR>
address is www.inform.dk/djembe/scd/scd002_2.html<BR>
She explains how things like sugar are added but not on the label, a<BR>
chemist tests for sweetness and adds sugar if necessary.  Also, she<BR>
quotes Dr. Haas about what can happen if you eat small amounts of<BR>
carbohydrates.  Scary.  Everyone should read this.<BR>
<BR>
Remember the big scandal with the apple juice a while back?  I saw<BR>
something on  20/20 or primetime where they chemically analyzed juice<BR>
and it was so much sugar.<BR>
<BR>
I agree, we can't trust what they say.  Elaine has said, though, that if<BR>
an organic tomato company like Muir says in a letter that the product is<BR>
safe, then it's probably safe.  In my opinion, it's because they have<BR>
more to lose if they are exposed adding things.<BR>

Hi Deanna and other SCD newbies,<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">
&gt; Well, so far I haven't received any replies about adding fruit and<BR>
&gt; veggies (see my previous post under this subject)... <BR></FONT>
<BR>
As I mention many times on this list (some may say &quot;preach&quot;), I
found<BR>
it best to only introduce *ONE* new item at a time.  If you try this<BR>
new item for 1-3 days, you chould notice if it agrees with you. As<BR>
long as you stick to *your* basic eating pattern, this will allow you<BR>
to judge what is OK for your body.  After 8 months on the diet, I<BR>
tried shelled peanuts... not good.  I tried again after 10 months,<BR>
and this time it was OK.  My point is that &quot;timing&quot; can make a<BR>
difference when a food becomes OK for you.  I had to wait until<BR>
2-3 months into the diet for eggs, cheese, honey, fruit and nut flour<BR>
to be OK for *me* (I did use honey and eggs in cheesecake recipe).<BR>
After more than a year on SCD, I still have problems with salad.<BR>
<BR>
Since you only have some D., perhaps it's OK to try cooked veggies<BR>
such as squashes (zuchini, spaghetti,...) since (I'm sure you know)<BR>
these are the first things introduce to babies.  Yes, your bowel is<BR>
like a baby's right now, and it needs to be retrained.  I would<BR>
wait on the cooked fruit until you see things are ok with the<BR>
cooked veggies (also try carrots). After cooked fruit works for you,<BR>
you could try raw bananas (with black spots) as it seems to work<BR>
well with most people. I eat 2-3 bananas per day with my yogurt/honey.<BR>

not a straight gradient leading gently uphill to perfect health at the peak<BR>

being off all drugs for two months my daughter is now back on them.  THis<BR>
after no cheating at all, 7 months on the diet. WHat precipitated this<BR>
flare was a cold virus.<BR>
Remember that Elaine says it took 2 full years on the diet before her<BR>
daughter was symptom-free.<BR>
Also, please everyone be aware that anti-inflammatory agents including<BR>
drugs, asprirn, vitamin E and possibly fish oils, are also blood thinners.<BR>
This means that if any bleeding is present, anti-inflammatories may make it<BR>
worse.<BR>

The diet is an adjunct to medication as has been stated publically by<BR>
Elaine, we all want to get of these drugs but in the *interim* don't fool<BR>
with medications like Prednisone.  Coming of that has to be done extremely<BR>

presently coming down on prednisone - she has been on it for about two<BR>
years)  You need not worry about the diet working because the medications<BR>
only alleviate the symptoms while the SCD gets to the root of the problem -<BR>
starve the bacteria.  This *soup* in the gut is in turmoil, it takes time<BR>
to reverse the biochemistry.  The opening sections of the book describe in<BR>
simple terms what is happening.  Not one of the medications (most borrowed<BR>

diet or medication are affecting change.<BR>

        Subject: <B>starting on the diet<BR>
        </B> 
        <P>Chris,<BR>
I have some advice concerning how to go about starting the diet.  The book
is not too clear on explaining this, but the allowable foods have to be
gradually introduced at a slow rate, depending on how inflamed you are at
the time.  You have to realize that some foods are easier to digest than
others, and sometimes you need a bit of partial &quot;bowel rest&quot;.  This can
be
accomplished by eating gentler foods for a week or two until things calm
down, and then you can start introducing more allowables one by one to see
if you tolerate them.
<P>Start by eating a lot of the chicken soup (recipe in the book), but when
cooked strain everything out, reserving the broth in one container, carrots
in another, and chicken in another.  Throw everything else out, including
the skin and bones of the chicken.  Refrigerate the broth overnite and the
fat will all rise to the top and solidify so you can remove it easily.
Puree the carrots and chicken and add to broth if desired for a rich creamy
soup, or eat them all separately. I tell you, this is a staple when
beginning on the diet.  You can eat several bowls a day.  Another good thing
to make is homemade jello using unflavored gelatin and Welch's grape juice
(no sugar added).  Just disolve the gelatin in the juice over med heat, pour
into little bowls and refrigerate.  When I was really sick, I would eat the
chicken soup, as described, the jello, lots of herbal teas with honey, and
pureed spaghetti squash, zuchinni, carrots, or chicken (all well cooked
first).  Sometimes cheeses are good too, as they seem to firm up the stool
(make sure you chew well though and experiment). You can also try yogurt
made with half and half and store bought powdered culture, as it may be
tolerable, and good with honey.  My girlfriend who has CD and has been on
the diet for 5 years tells me all the time &quot;the yogurt is our
medicine!&quot;.  I
think it does help a lot, but some people can't tolerate it at first.
<P>When the gut is really inflamed, it helps to eat pureed food because it
gives your digestive system a break.  Not many people mention this, but it
worked for me.  It is easier to break down food that is already well chewed,
so to speak.  When the stool becomes semi-formed and the pain and gas
subside, then I would introduce the same foods, in solid form.  Depending on
my symptoms thereafter, I would introduce scrambled eggs, homemade yogurt
and sour cream, homemade applesauce, and dry curd.  
<P>From there on, you can start introducing different allowables, but do it one
by one, so you can test the effect based on your stool and your symptoms.  A
key that I found is that you should make sure you never get dehydrated by
taking in plenty of fluids, and once you find something you can eat that
doesn't cause immediate pain and diarhea, eat more of it, as much as you
can. A common mistake is to not eat enough quantity of the food.  Think
about the fact that these foods are all you can tolerate, so you must
increase the quantities in order to get enough calories.  It is fine to use
butters and oils in the preparation of the meats and cooked vegies because
you need the calories.  Don't worry about variety in the beginning, give
your gut a chance to heal and once it is healed, you can eat all sorts of
things.
<P>The last things to introduce are raw fruits and vegetables, nut flour, and
whole nuts, anything with seeds, and beans and legumes. These should only be
introduced after 1-3 months on the diet, and then only one by one to test
the tolerablity.  Skin and seeds of fruits and vegies should always be
removed in the beginning.  And remember, if you can't tolerate a given food
at one point in time, stop eating it, and try it again in a week or a month.
As the gut is allowed to heal (from the diet) you will be able to tolerate
more and more foods.  After about a month the feeling of emptiness, constant
hunger and carbohydrate cravings will go away.  The habit of the diet will
stick if you force yourself, and this is the only way.  It is NOT easy by
any means to stick to this diet, but the results are more than worth it in
the long run.
<P>This has been my experience so I thought I would pass it on.  I am somewhat
of a veteran to the SCD and although I have never stayed on it long enough
to get a permanent cure (my own fault), I have proven to myself time and
time again that it works!  The last time I stayed on the diet for about a
year and then I went off and returned to a bad diet including a lot of
refined and junk foods.  My remission lasted about 9 months in spite of my
poor eating habits and being medication free for over a year and a half.
Then I got a flare up and I immediately went back on the diet, according to
how I have described it above.  The first week it seemed like I was getting
worse and worse.  I thought I would NEVER get better, and had to stay home
in bed.  After about 10 days of eating the intro stuff, my stool began to
improve so I started introducing more things.  I started to get better, but
my energy was still zero.  After two weeks in total, I was able to eat solid
food (most allowables) and I felt like my old self again.
<P>This diet is definately capable of inducing remission in many people, but if
introduced wrong, it can be detrimental, leading some to think it doesn't
work at all.  This time I am planning to stay on the SCD for 2 years
minimum, no matter how great I feel.  You see, when this diet puts you into
remission, and you are able to get off of all meds, after a while you get to
feel so good that the memory of the pain and suffering becomes somewhat
vague, tempting you to cheat.  You feel like you don't even have an illness
anymore, and it's easy to get lax and gradually return to a regular diet.
And a lot of North American &quot;regular diets&quot;  are full of crap, which
will
just cause us to get sick again.  Elaine was very right in saying &quot;It is
hoped that no one who recovers from his or her problem by following the SCD
ever returns to a diet high in refined sugar and refined flours.&quot;  I made
the mistake of doing that, and now am starting over.  I am writing this so
others may learn from my mistakes.  Pages 51 and 52 in the book (the last 2
pgs of Chapter 8), explain some of what I said, but not as detailed. Good
luck, and I hope this helps in some way.<BR>

<BR>Subject: <B>Introduction</B>
<BR>
I would like to introduce myself. My name is Janice. I am new to the list &amp;
for a couple of days have been reading your email.  I have been through a very
rough period, beginning Feb. '98, requiring blood  transfusions, hospital stays,
etc., but am happy to report that since Oct. I have been feeling quite well. 
<BR> <BR> I have been faithfully following the SCD since April, and am also
taking sulfasalazine. <BR> <BR> I feel very fortunate to have found an excellent
gastroenterologist who is actively  involved in research into IBD &amp; who is
quite innovative in his treatment of it. <BR> <BR> Having consulted with 2 other
gastroenterologists previously, I realize that there are  probably many doctors
who don't give there patients the benefit of the advice that I received from him
&amp; for this reason I feel compelled to share it with you. His advice was as
follows:<BR> <BR>  -iron pills can aggravate this condition so he advises iron
injections in the  case of iron deficiency anemia<BR>  -remove lactose from the
diet<BR>  -DO NOT TAKE ANTIBIOTICS UNLESS YOU ARE DYING OF A BACTERIAL 
INFECTION. If antibiotics are NECESSARY Ciprofloxicin is the least   harmful in
terms of IBD. Use that if appropriate.<BR>  -Eating natural yogurt with live
cultures is one of the best ways to reculture   the bowel.<BR>  -eat plenty of
vegetables, fruit, poultry and fish. Limit beef consumption<BR> <BR> <BR> When I
asked him his opinion about the SCD, he said that there is no proof that it
works, but that he would have no objection to me following it as long as I had no
problem with weight loss associated with it. He enabled me to follow it during my
stay in hospital. <BR> <BR> In order to avoid antibiotics I have begun eating raw
garlic at the first sign of colds/ flu/sore throat etc. I first tried it because
you can hardly pick up a magazine without reading about its antibacterial
properties &amp; I was quite certain that at the very least it wouldn't hurt me.
It seems to work for me. (My husband also). <BR> <BR> In order to minimize the
strong taste &amp; smell I chop a garlic clove up fine &amp; take it on a spoon,
a bit at a time, without chewing it, &amp; wash it down quickly with warm water.
You will still smell it on your breath &amp; taste it, but nobody wants to get
too close to you when you're sick anyway, so I don't find it to be a problem. I
take 4 cloves/day on an empty stomach when fighting a &quot;bug&quot;, followed
by some fruit or yogurt. <BR> <BR> In closing I would like to say that I am very
thankful to have found the SCD &amp; to  have had the opportunity to speak to
Elaine personally &amp; benefit from her advice. I am not ready to proclaim to
the world that it is working for me, but I am optimistic. <BR> <BR> Best regards,
<BR> Janice

<P>Dear Deena:<BR>
I am so sorry to hear about your son. But I do think you have found a
great place to start helping him. Last spring my mom was very sick and
was diagnosed with Crohn's. They wanted to take her colon out but we
decided to bring her home and try the SCD diet instead. We bought the
book and found this site. Both have been a god send.
<P>From reading all of the messages posted here daily, I have noticed a
common theme. There were certain foods that a lot of people couldn't
tolerate before the diet. In fact a lot of them were sure that eating
certain items on the diet would send them into a tail spin, because they
surely had done so in the past. It seems to me that once the diet is
started and you are eating only the food that has been researched to be
SCD safe or what I think of as actually digestible by someone with a
digestion disorder, then previous food which you couldn't eat, now
become digestible. <BR>I think you may be surprised after removing foods you
now think are ok for him (but are not SCD safe) and slowly adding in
other foods on the list. All you can do is try. It is just food you are
experimenting with not some synthetic chemical drug. What can it hurt to
try him on the basic diet for a while and then start to slowly add in
other SCD foods. This could be the answer, but you won't know unless you
try. <BR>It is amazing just hearing the members talk about the restorative
powers of the home made yogurt. The diet seems to allow the body to move
into a state of healing. It's kind of like a cut, the cut will heal, but
not as long as you keep jabbing it with a sharp object. The gut can't
heal as long as you keep exposing it to food that it can not digest.
<P>The human body is an amazing thing. I truly believe that it has the
power to heal itself, if just given the right help. Please, definitely
at least call Elaine. She is a powerhouse and if she at all thinks that
this diet will help your son, she will tell you truthfully. When I got
off the phone from her about my mother, I was full of energy and ready
to take on the world of doubting doctors. At least discuss it with her.

Sue,<BR><BR>
I did not see any lasting improvement until I had been on the
diet for almost 4 months, except for relief from the terrible gas
and bloating I had been experiencing (it left me quite early in
the diet.)<BR><BR>
When you say you have trouble with the dairy do you mean cheese,
yogurt, or both? Make sure that you are making the yogurt correctly.
If you don't heat the milk to a high enough temp. before cooling and
adding the yogurt you may have a problem. The yogurt, if it's made 
properly, from my experience should be 'set'  when it's done (not 
runny). I had to experiment a bit before I got it right.
<BR><BR>
Here are a few suggestions that may help:<BR><UL>
  1) Do not eat any raw vegetables or fruit except very ripe bananas
      until the D is gone. (I didn't).<BR>
  2) If you think dairy is bothering you, eliminate cheese to start with
      but continue with properly prepared yogurt. See how you do. If 
      necessary you can eliminate the yogurt, but take probiotics 
      instead.<BR>
  3) Eliminate eggs if they cause problems. When you have improved
      cautiously try adding them back. If you still don't tolerate them
      eliminate them permanently.<BR>
  4) Keep the amount of honey that you ingest to a minimum until
      the D clears.<BR>
  5) Drink ginger tea with lemon juice (3-4 cups/day). Ginger contains
      high levels of the enzymes that break down meat (protease), and
      lipase which breaks down fat. It promotes good digestion. Lab 
      studies have demonstrated that ginger inhibits the bacteria in the
      colon that work away at undigested sugars. It reduces the production
      of prostaglandins (which can cause inflamation). It kills viruses,
fungi.<BR>
  6) Take some raw garlic. It kills fungi, bacteria, some parasites,
reduces
      blood sugar levels, etc. (Benefits to health are too numerous to
      mention here...it's good for what ails you!)<BR>
</UL>
I'm sorry to keep harping about ginger and garlic...I've just had such 
positive experiences with them myself. I think if you're struggling 
they're worth a try. At least you can be sure that they won't harm you.<BR><BR>

Subject: <B>Re: Pain - Crohn's Disease</B><BR>
<P>Doug,
<P>I have had Crohn's disease for 10 1/2 years.  I started the SCD diet at
Christmastime this year, exactly 10 years after my initial diagnosis.  
<P>My docs. always said diet had minimal or no effect.  They gave me some
really scary books which recommended avoiding a few foods, but nothing very
definitive, and nothing that was really helpful.
<P>I did have pain, usually like sharp shooting cramps.  There were a few
times when it felt like I could be blocked up - I thought I was going to
die or explode  and then die.  It generally felt like there were foods,
though I didn't recognize which ones, which were too bulky, and my narrowed
and inflamed gut couldn't take it.
<P>As Deanna said, the first thing to go away with the SCD was the pain and
discomfort of all types.  I actually experienced the beginning of this
before I started the diet, because I hadn't gotten the book yet.  I just
went on what little I could figure out from what I'd read.  When I
eliminated ALL refined carbs, and especially when I figured out that sugar
was a carb (duh...), I experienced a major reduction in pain.  
<P>So, even if you don't have the book yet you may get some improvement just
by eliminating everything you recognize as a carb, especially sugar.
<P>Since starting the diet completely I have experienced a major improvement
in all my symptoms, as well as a return to my normal weight (almost - 3 or
so more pounds would be fine, but having gained back 25 I'm feeling
incredible).  And there's hope - while I don't claim to think about sex
even 75% pf the time, there was a while there when I felt like I had
absolutely no sex drive at all.  That is no longer the case.
<P>So, this diet clearly does make a major difference for a huge number of
people.  It can give you your life back.  Six months ago Crohn's controlled
me, my emotions and many of my actions and words.  Now I am in control
again, I have energy again, and I am smiling again without having to force
it!  
<P>Lastly, don't expect ANY support from doctors.  You may get lucky, and have
one who will support, or at the least accept, what you're trying.  Chances
are good however, that they will give you active discouragement.  That is
what I got.  I ignored them.  They obviously didn't know what they were
talking about.  You will know what makes a difference for you far better
than they do soon enough.
<P>And remember - this diet is not a hardship in any way when compared to what
Crohn's disease can do to your life!
<P>Good luck,<BR>
Nancy

<P>Sherilyn,
<P>You asked: &Uacute;quot;Nancy, PLEASE tell me your secret.&Uacute;quot;
<P>The reason I am so thankful for this mental state of mind is that when I
first started the SCD last summer I did not have this advantage.  And I
couldn't quite adhere to it 100%.  Every few weeks I would eat a bite or
two of something I shouldn't have.  
        <P>I stopped getting sicker, but I didn't get healthy with this approach. 
          The memory of that, combined with the misery of this fall when I was 
          off the diet have given me this connection between forbidden foods and 
          pain. In other words I was so sick there is NOTHING that would make 
          me risk ending up back there. When I think &quot;What I wouldn't give 
          to be able to try a little of&quot;; some food, my next thought is &quot;The 
          one thing I WOULDN'T give is the health I have gained in the last 2 
          months.&quot;
        <P>You also wrote: &quot;I'm happy to say that I've been fanatically on 
          the diet for five days now. I know that's not a lot to most of you, 
          but I'm SO proud of myself! It's really hard to avoid something you're 
          addicted to.&quot;
        <P>No, it is not easy, but it gets easier the longer you stick with it. 
Really.  The first days are the hardest, and as the diet changes over
from being an effort to being a habit a new frame of mind sets in.  The
addiction is in the process of being broken.
<P>GOOD LUCK!!

<P>Hi again,
<P>&gt;I have heard back from several people now <BR>
&gt;telling me that the diet has worked<BR>
&gt;for them.  Why is it that the doctors refuse <BR>
&gt;to believe that something so<BR>
&gt;simple as diet can make a difference?  <BR>
&gt;Have you told your doctor that the diet<BR>
&gt;has worked for you?<BR>

<P>I never bothered discussing it with my doctor as he was determined that
people not hear about it or use it.  If most intestinal diseases can be
cured by the SCD, how many gastroenterologists are going to want to tell
people it works?  Instead of having constant visits for prescriptions,
exams, tests, hospitalizations (which are *very* lucrative - they make
rounds and see all their patients who are in the hospital for about one or
two minutes each, and charge a fortune) and surgeries, they would have one
visit and test for diagnosis, and then all those people who were disciplined
enough to stay on the diet and do the few other things that might be
necessary to become well, would never darken their office doors again.
Plus, there would be fewer initial visits for diagnosis as more people heard
about the diet (which they would if all the gastroenterologists were
prescribing it).

<P>&gt;Yes, the diet is a lot of work.  It seems <BR>
&gt;like I have been cooking around the<BR>
&gt;clock.  Since my son is currently on <BR>
&gt;prednisone, he is very hungry all of the<BR>
&gt;time.  I really don't think that the <BR>
&gt;diet will be that much work once I get<BR>
&gt;used to it.  It seemed a bit overwhelming <BR>
&gt;the first couple of days, but I just<BR>
&gt;keep reading the book over and over  <BR>
&gt;again so that I can get a good grasp on<BR>
&gt;it.  I think the most difficult part <BR>
&gt;right now is going out to eat.<BR>

<P>Going out to eat isn't all that difficult, as long as one doesn't go to bad
restaurants, as they use fake food (real food is expensive, as is labor).
As long as you go to decent restaurants that don't serve frozen dinners
(you'd be surprised how many restaurants do this - even chicken breast is
often not chicken breast - the restaurant buys packages of boned, cooked
cutlets injected with things like corn syrup and other sugars, MSG, milk
solids, gums, etc.).

<P>&gt;Also,<BR>
&gt;birthday parties, easter, etc.  These events are important <BR>
&gt;to a ten year old<BR>
&gt;and he feels left out.  <BR>
&gt;Is that any type of bread that is allowed?<BR>

<P>When your son can tolerate almond flour, Lois Lang's bread recipe is great
for sandwiches.  Your son would be able to take a ham (made only with
dextrose and/or honey!) and cheese sandwich to school for lunch if he wanted
to, with fruit and yogurt for dessert, or carrot cake.

<P>&gt;Also, so<BR>
&gt;far I haven't been about to find dry curd <BR>
&gt;cottage cheese.  Can you point me<BR>
&gt;in the right direction?<BR>

<P>
I use Friendship Dairy's Farmer's Cheese which is usually near cream cheese
and yogurt in the grocery store.  Friendship (they make dry curd cottage
cheese -dccc- but it's hard to get and you usually have to buy an immense
quantity) assured me that it has no more lactose than the dccc, and it
tastes much better too, as it has added cream and salt.

<P>If your son is interested in that sort of thing, he may want to look at some
sites such as <A HREF="http://www.panix.com/%7epaleodiet/">
http://www.panix.com/~paleodiet/</A> ...  He might find it
interesting to learn about when agriculture started, what effect it had on
people's health (which deteriorated) and height (boys usually want to grow
tall), and even that cancer rates are higher, the more grain people eat.  It
is extremely hard for children to really stick to a diet like this, and you
will have to expect that he'll most likely cheat (and probably not tell you
about it, if he gets an upsetting reaction), and have flare ups of the
disease because of it.  Eventually, he'll realize it's not worth it.  Most
adults go through this at first, also.  It will make it easier for him if
you *never* eat all those tempting &quot;goodies&quot; that he can't have, even
when
he's not around.
<P>Take care,
<P>Deborah

Subject: <B>Pep talk:thoughts on starting the SCD</B><BR>
<P>Hi<BR>
My husband has been on the SCD for 14 months.  He was originally diagnosed
with colitis in 86, then rediagnosed to crohn's in 88.  in 88 he had a
serious flare and had to quit university.  He was able to keep symptoms at
low levels until 1997 when he was hospitalized 4X with intestinal blockages.
Then I put him on the SCD and within 3 weeks he was doing wonderfully.

<P>The cooking for the diet is very hard to adapt to at first.  Our culture is
used to convenience foods.  Learning a whole new way of cooking, especially
at a very stressful time of acute illness, can be very hard indeed.  When my
husband started the diet, I also had a colicky 5 month old who was still
waking up twice a night.  Believe me, I was EXHAUSTED.  I remember going to
the grocery store to buy coconut, and it just seemed overwhelming, finding
one package out of five that had no added sugar.  I thought, &quot;I have to do
this for ALL the food I buy???? This is just too much!&quot;  I got through on
stubborn determination.  I didn't get any extra help, because I didn't want
to hear them saying &quot;Are you SURE that the diet is the right thing?  Are you
SURE?&quot;  Sometimes, comments are harder to deal with than working 18 hours a
day.

<P>But eventually, you learn and adapt.  Everything becomes old hat, and habit.
Making yogurt is no big deal, and you learn the brand names that are
allowed.  You turn your kitchen into an efficient workspace, and get the
tools you need.  Cooking in advance helps.   Shopping is easier because
there's fewer ingredients.  There's still more work, but it's nothing like
what our grandparents and great grandparents went through.  I'd say
virtually all their day was spent on their food supply, and we have freezers
and fridges and grocery stores.

<P>Since I have a small child and one on the way, I realize that there won't be
much time for my interests for some time.  I sneak in creative projects when
there's time and things are under control.  I said &quot;OK, I'm going to devote
my creative energies into cooking&quot;.  I look upon this time in my life as a
season, though there is a possibility that Brad will remain on the diet for
life.  But that's not so bad!  It's so healthy and I feel good on the diet
as well.  I have my husband back from the valley of the shadow of death,
which is the best gift of all.   So fire up those food processors! Yeah!

<P>Regards, Alison

<P>Joanne,
<P>Since you can't find your copy of BTVC, here's the basic diet:
<P>-homemade chicken soup<BR>
-eggs (boiled, poached or scrambled)<BR>
-DCCC<BR>
-yogurt<BR>
-homemade gelatin made with juice, unflavoured gelatin, sweetener<BR>
-other meats<BR>
-cheese cake<BR>
-apple cider or grape juice (1/2 juice, 1/2 water)<BR>
<P>I also added very ripe bananas and other cooked vegetables. DON'T EAT AT ANY
FAST FOOD PLACES!
<P>Someone told me on the phone, I think it was Lucy, that you can get pure
tylenol powder from the pharmacist if you request it. It's best to go to a
compounding pharmacy for this I think.
<P>Hope you feel much better soon,
Janice

Subject: <B>Re: Cocoa and canned beans</B><BR>
<P>Hi Heather,
<P>&gt; I have just begun this diet in the past month and have a few<BR>
&gt; questions if anyone has answers.  In the book it is stated<BR>
&gt; that one can not eat chocolate or carob.  Does this include cocoa<BR>
&gt; and if so, why?  I am also wondering about canned beans ( such as<BR>
&gt; kidney beans for chili). I think I can have the dried beans as she<BR>
&gt; says but I am wondering what is wrong with canned beans with labels<BR>
&gt; saying they do not contain any additives. Any other advice would be<BR>
&gt; appreciated! Thanks, Heather.<BR>
<P>Carob and chocolate (cocoa is chocolate with some or all of the cocoa butter
removed) have the type of carbs we cannot digest.  We are not allowed to eat
disaccharides or polysaccharides.
<P>Canned products can have ingredients not listed on the label, as can
prepared foods.  Legally, companies do not have to list anything that makes
up less than 2% of the product.  Plus, some manufacturers have actually been
caught mislabeling their products, claiming, for instance, that they added
no sugar, when they actually did.
<P>Take care,
<P>Deborah

<P>Hi Paula S,<BR>
Welcome to the list.<BR>
Yes a heating pad does make a sore tummy feel better. So does a warm
bath with some herbal oils added. Take good care of your spirit as you
help yourself  heal....
<BR>Your Gastro doctor will probably say it doesn't matter what you eat, but
suddenly get an attitude when you tell him your eating healthy
unprocessed foods. Ignore his advice concerning food. Nutrition is
completely beyond most medical practitioners scope and knowledge as a
method of healing. Most Gastroenterologist are educated about medicine
and surgery.
<BR>Keep eating the chicken soup, broiled hamburgers, eggs , cooked squash
and farmers cheese (aka: Dry curd cottage cheese). Buy yourself a yogurt
maker quickly and start eating plenty of homemade yogurt. You won't need
calcium supplement if your eating yogurt. For all vitamins and
supplements I follow carefully the recommendation that Elaine gives in
the book.<BR>
It has worked well for me.<BR>
<BR>In the beginning to add calories eat avocados,  make  the yogurt with
whole real cream, or half and half from the health food store (no
additives)
<BR>Create  your own high calorie shakes in the blender:<BR>
1 cup pure apple juice<BR>
table spoon of walnut oil (or more)<BR>
1/2 cup high fat yogurt<BR>
very ripe bananas<BR>
blended with three ice cubes.<BR>
<P>Don't forget<BR>
DRINK AT LEAST EIGHT LARGE GLASSES OF WATER A DAY!!!<BR>
