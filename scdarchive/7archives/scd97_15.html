I just got back from my colonoscopy. I had my first colonoscopy last<BR>
May. It was awful and I had a severe case of UC. Ulcers were<BR>
everywhere. Well, today all ulcers were gone. No trace. I don't know<BR>
how common this is, the nurses seemed so blasse. I have been on this<BR>
diet for 9 months now. I also had 4 cranial sacral therapy sessions and<BR>
I'm taking Tai Chi. I think these things worked in concert with one<BR>
another to heal me. I guess it's possible for the ulcers to come back<BR>
but I'm not sure. I do know that the doctor will tell me that this is<BR>
just a remission and that it will come and go. They also took biopsies<BR>
to test for cancer since my last c showed signs of dysplasia. That<BR>
always scares the hell out of me. But that's just when I say to myself<BR>

Dear Nora,<BR>
A soulmate!! I too got an all clear on my colonoscopy after being on the<BR>
diet only 6 months. My doctor also blamed the event on some kind of bizzare<BR>
remission. I've had another one since (this past Jan) which also came up<BR>
clear as a bell. He's not only speechless, but I hear he's passing on the<BR>
diet to those interested in nutrition with their pills. I'm no longer on<BR>
any meds at all. Took myself off about 8 months ago.What a great gift<BR>
hearing from you today. Today is exactly 2 years on this miraculous diet.<BR>
As for tai chi, I've been studying martial arts (karate) for 14 years and<BR>
tested and received my 2nd degree black belt last friday night. The only<BR>
thing you &amp; I don't have in common is the cranial sacral therapy. Please<BR>
tell me more about it. Although my colon is in incredible health, I do have<BR>
problems with arthritis &amp; wonder if this wouldn't help. Please keep
me<BR>
posted. I'm thrilled for you. For me too.<BR>

<B>Re: NOVO-LOPERAMIDE</B><BR>
Fri, 2 May 1997 1:42:42 GMT<BR>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1><BR>
&gt;Hello everyone!<BR>
&gt;I went to see my GI specialist yesterday afternoon. One of my few<BR>
&gt;complaints was the urgency I experience in the afternoons. This symptom
has<BR>
&gt;improved immensely without anything but I would like to see a bit more<BR>
&gt;improvement just to make the day easier and for me to have the confidence
to<BR>
&gt;be more active in the afternoon. ( My frequency has decreased greatly
but it<BR>
&gt;is in the afternoons that I have the bulk of my bowel movements and
it is<BR>
&gt;rather inconvenient to be proccupied with the toilet when you'd like
to be<BR>
&gt;absorbed in other activities.) Any way he prescribed NOVO-LOPERAMIDE<BR>
&gt;otherwise known as Immodium. He suggested taking one 2mg tablet with
my<BR>
&gt;lunch to help with the afternoon urgency. I was wondering if anyone
on the<BR>
&gt;diet has tried this. I would appreciate any comments regarding it.<BR>
&gt;I've been on the diet 14 months, sticking with it faithfully; lots of<BR>
&gt;improvements aiming for even more!<BR>
&gt;THANKS<BR>

<BR>
Urgency and diarhea are a reaction to a build up of toxins in the bowel.<BR>
your bowel movements should be mostly in the morning, so as to &quot;empty&quot;
out<BR>
the toxins and give you a &quot;light/clear/non-toxic&quot; burst of energy
for the<BR>
working day. Ways to encourage early morning evacuation are:<BR>
<BR>
1. drink 2-3 glasses of water IMMEDIATELY upon rising. This is also the<BR>
best time to take an acidophilus (POWDER ONLY) suplement. with the LAST<BR>
glass of water<BR>
<BR>
2. Get active immediately after you take the water. don't go out until you<BR>
have emptied your bowels. you will soon get the urge to go. you may need
to<BR>
go a few times (2-5) times. Be patient with this as you retrain your body<BR>
as to the correct time to do this. After you feel comfortable (empty) and<BR>
if you have U.C., now is the best time to take a prednisone enema or just
a<BR>
supositry .<BR>
<BR>
3. take 1 teaspoon of slippery elm and 1 teaspoon of psyllium husks with<BR>
juice just before bed with 1-2 glasses of water. This will help to build
a<BR>
formed stool for the following morning<BR>
<BR>
4. As things improve, (1-2 weeks) start to take Take Slippery Elm 4 times
a<BR>
day and psyllium 2-4 times per day (less or no psyllium if you are<BR>
bleeding).<BR>
<BR>
5. Around lunch time, use a smooth 2-3mm thick piece of solid natural<BR>
material (jade or other smooth stone with an edge. or polished wood or just<BR>
use your finger nails together (pushing down not scratching up). Do not
use<BR>
plastic in contact with the skin. Firmly Massage the front of the thighs<BR>
and the small of the back along the spine; as will as the lower arms with<BR>
about 20 strokes each. Always stroke in the direction away from the heart.<BR>
Doing this will dissipate accumulated toxins and neutralise the bodies<BR>
reflex to &quot;go&quot; (ie reduce urgency if you do it right you can stop
diarrhea)<BR>
<BR>

<B>Re: My 2 cents--Weaning from Prednisone/alternatives...</B><BR>
Sat, 3 May 1997 17:16:46 GMT<BR>
<BR>
MARY WROTE:<BR>
<BR>
I've been battling what has recently been diagnosed as Crohn's of the<BR>
colon (started as bleeding hemmorhoids, then became U.C.) for about 5<BR>
years and have the traditional round of meds, including varying doses <BR>
of prednisone for about 5 years. Had a successful pregnancy but after <BR>
my daughter was born this past September I went downhill, losing lots <BR>
of weight and having more severe symptoms. Tried the diet for a month <BR>
and got to 100 lbs. (I'm 5'8&quot; and normally a slim 140) so my doc.<BR>
reccomended intravenous feeding (TPN) for bowel rest (I'm eating<BR>
NOTHING),increased prednisone in I.V. form, and the immunosuppressive<BR>
drug Imuran. I still believe in the diet, but further reading has<BR>
convinced me I have a profound Candida problem (apparently Candida<BR>
thrives on Prednisone and other hormones) so I believe I must cut out<BR>
fruits,honey, and cheeses and stick to mostly meats and vegies. I've<BR>
told my doc &quot;no!&quot; at this time to Imuran, and he has reluctantly
<BR>
agreed to watch my progress for a few months on the diet, warning me <BR>
that I risk perforation of the colon, etc. if my condition doesn't <BR>
improve. I am feeling yucky from increased prednisone but feel chained <BR>
to this drug despite my fears.<BR>
<BR>
I was hoping to hear input from you folks who have had similar<BR>
treatments - did you when you started the diet go easy on <BR>
honey,fruits, cheeses or did you find diarreah worsened when you ate <BR>
these things? Has anyone tried Nystatin or other yeast killing drugs? <BR>
I've heard these can make you really sick as the yeast dies off. <BR>
<BR>
*****************************<BR>
<BR>
Hi Mary:<BR>
<BR>
I don't have Crohn's, so this might not relate to your problems <BR>
exactly. I do/did have severe Candida when I started this diet, and a <BR>
leaky gut caused by that candida. Thinking I would follow the diet <BR>
exactly, I was thrilled to have honey and fruit. These definitely <BR>
caused bloating and other candida-related problems, so I have totally <BR>
cut these things out. I am not so sure about cheese, though, I know <BR>
they always say to avoid mould when you have candida, but I don't find <BR>
it to be a real problem. You could try some cheeses with very low <BR>
carbohydrate content, like cheddar, if you want to experiment. <BR>
<BR>
I have taken Nystatin, as well as the much more powerful <BR>
Diflucan. I didn't find the die-off problems to be very disturbing, <BR>
but I guess some people do for the first few days. If you take <BR>
Diflucan, be prepared for some hormonal side-effects (it makes the <BR>
body produce estrogen). In my view, the advice in Elaine's book <BR>
(aside from the sugars) has helped to keep my candida under control <BR>
without the drugs now. By consuming foods that are easily digested, <BR>
the nutrient supply is apparently cut off to the candida, which seems <BR>
to reside mostly in the lower gut. So the heavy carbo diet <BR>
recommended by many individuals treating candida may still be feeding <BR>
the candida if you have a severe case. I couldn't fully control the <BR>
candida before I started the diet, possibly because I was still <BR>
consuming vast amounts of rice, buckwheat, quinoa, etc. I have had a <BR>
dramatic improvement in the two months since I started. But I am a <BR>
stringbean myself now, which is a bit of a concern.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps a bit.<BR>

<B>Re: Candida and SCD</B><BR>
Sat, 3 May 1997 17:54:42 GMT<BR>
<BR>
When I started the diet I too was delighted to be able to have so many<BR>
goodies -- but I immediately started having trouble with gas and<BR>
bloating and looser stool when I had honey. Chesse doesn't bother me,<BR>
but I now cut it out because I find I have less mucus when I do. <BR>
Previously, when I had my lab tests done that isolated the bacteria that<BR>
have caused me such gut trouble (diarrhea, auto immune and leaky gut<BR>
symptoms) -- they found no candida. However, symptoms are symptoms, and<BR>
I find I don't bloat or get gas if I stay away from honey and certain<BR>
fruits. <BR>
<BR>
I've been able to tolerate small quantities of grape juice and apple<BR>
juice, and I use those in place of honey in the bread/muffin recipe<BR>
(works well). I also cut out carrots and try to restrict my winter<BR>
squash as well. This leaves me eating a lot of nuts, eggs, chicken,<BR>
fish, zucchini, summer squash, tomatoes, onions. There -- I pretty much<BR>
can name all the foods I eat right now! My condition doesn't seem to be<BR>
very bad, so I keep hoping any day to be able to have honey so I can try<BR>
that carrot cake recipe that came through the list recently! I do know<BR>
that even though it's hard, dealing with candida while on the scd is<BR>
possible and preferable to me to eating the grains that have caused me<BR>
such trouble.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding yeast die-off, I find it helped if I drank a lot of water,<BR>
more than I usually would. The exercises Michael was suggesting for<BR>
toxin build-up sound interesting as well and I would consider trying<BR>
especially the massage he recommends. For achiness I found that epsom<BR>
salt baths helped immensely. I never took Nystatin, but my husband<BR>
did. It didn't help him very much. He is helped more by doing the scd<BR>
and cutting out sugar (fruit, honey) as well.<BR>
<BR>
I too am becoming a string bean on this diet, even though I feel like I<BR>
am eating vaster quantities of food than I've eaten in my life!<BR>

<B>Re[2]: Diet after colon removal</B><BR>
Mon, 5 May 1997 15:40:34 GMT<BR>
<BR>
I'm interested in this subject too. At present it is hard for me to <BR>
know what I am digesting and what I'm not - after being on the SCD for <BR>
8 months, I had a flare, and tried to wait it out by staying on the <BR>
diet and staying out of work for 10 weeks. Nearly died once again (for <BR>
the fifth time in 4 years) but I felt this last flare might be the <BR>
'first-year relapse' in Elaine's book. But it went on and on, and I <BR>
ended up too weak to walk, needing 3 pints of blood, all veins <BR>
collapsed etc. For me, it was the end of the road, for I have tried <BR>
everything I can think of both medically and alternatively over the <BR>
past 10 years, and I opted for surgery. I am halfway through my <BR>
ileoanal pouch procedure, which means I have a temporary diverting <BR>
ileostomy while my new pouch, made from 20 cms at the end of my small <BR>
intestine, heals. My entire colon - Yikes - is gone. In a month my <BR>
ileostomy will be reversed, and I'll eliminate the 'normal' way, <BR>
except more often. If any of you are having nightmares reading this, <BR>
join the club - I would have done, and did do everything possible to <BR>
avoid this fate. Now that it's done, I am grieved, but want to nourish <BR>
myself in the best way possible, and wonder if I should stay on the <BR>
SCD (currently I'm avoiding wheat, but eating corn meal, beans, <BR>
starches, - eveything well-chewed). But it doesn't make sense to me <BR>
that I can now blithely eat whatever I want when my digestion must be <BR>
impaired by removing my colon. On the other hand, I'm gaining health <BR>
and strength (but no weight yet) and since all my output is relatively <BR>
soft and there's no more blood, it's hard to know what's agreeing with <BR>
me.<BR>
Sorry for the long note. I'd just appreciate any input, suggested <BR>
reading, anecdotal evidence, moral support for my 'gut' feeling that <BR>
the SCD still makes sense for me even with my colon gone.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks! Lynne<BR>

<B>diverticulitis / seeds</B><BR>
Mon, 5 May 1997 16:32:12 GMT<BR>
<BR>
Victor, <BR>
Regarding the seeds, they are allowed on the SCD but Elaine recommends in
the<BR>
book that you do not eat them until all symptoms have disappeared, and then<BR>
only introduce them by trial and error. After being on the diet for several<BR>
months (I had little or no symptoms), I decided to try some roasted pumkin<BR>
seeds that I got out of a pumkin and roasted myself. I ate 3 seeds only.
<BR>
Within a few minutes I got diarreah and cramps. I have avoided them ever<BR>
since. I believe that seeds are not the easiest thing to digest. Everyone
is<BR>
different, so I would not rule out seeds entirely. But I would wait until
you<BR>
are symptom free and then experiment. Apparently a lot of people on this
diet<BR>
are eating tahini, which is ground up sesame seeds. I would try that first.
<BR>
Raw sesame seeds contain more calcium than any other food on earth (I heard).<BR>
<BR>
Regarding whether or not or how the SCD can work for diverticulitis, I would<BR>
definately call Elaine personally and ask her. I got the impression from
her<BR>
that she doesn't mind a phone call at all. She actually seems to prefer
a call<BR>
to a fax or letter because it takes much longer to reply to people longhand.
I<BR>
don't have her new number (since she moved), but someone on this list does,
so<BR>
whoever that is, could you please post Elaine's new phone #.<BR>
<BR>
I really think this is your best bet Victor, because most of the people
on this<BR>
list have IBD or IBS I believe. You are the first I have heard from with<BR>
diverticulitis.<BR>

<B>Re: Nystatin, Psyllium, etc.</B><BR>
Tue, 6 May 1997 14:50:59 GMT<BR>
<BR>
For the past 6 weeks, I have made some changes which have really<BR>
helped me. I starting taking Nystatin and Psyllium and limiting the<BR>
amount of honey, fruit, and cheeses I eat. Although this initially<BR>
(for a week or two) did give me some more diarrhea and some gas and<BR>
odor in my b.m.s (which I hadn't experienced previously), these things<BR>
didn't last. I believe that this was the infamous candida die-off<BR>
reaction. Over the past several weeks, I have had MANY NORMAL b.m.s.<BR>
It HAD been years since I had ONE.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to all of the people on this list who have spoken against<BR>
candida and for Nystatin and Psyllium. Some of the credit also is due<BR>
to a nutritionist/doctor team who I consulted and who prescribed the<BR>
Nystatin and recommended the Psyllium and dietary changes -- Doug<BR>
Kaufmann and Dave Holland of Nutrition Resources in North Dallas. I<BR>
had heard them on the &quot;Your Health Matters&quot; radio show (Saturdays
from<BR>
7-9 AM on WKRD 94.9 FM in Dallas and 1-3 hours elsewhere in the<BR>
nation) which Doug hosts and went in for 2 consultations, so far. It<BR>
is so refreshing to find medical practitioners who recognize the<BR>
connection between diet and IBD.<BR>
<BR>
I thank God for what I see as truly an answer to prayer.<BR>

<B>Re: SCD: Tuna &amp; DHEA</B><BR>
Tue, 6 May 1997 16:39:58 GMT<BR>
<BR>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt; For me, Rosa makes a very timely comment about tuna,
as just this week <BR>
&gt; I was looking at the tins trying to figure out which to buy. The <BR>
&gt; better brands, like Bumble Bee white in water, have many more <BR>
&gt; ingredients than the cheaper brands and types like light tuna. Does
<BR>
&gt; anyone else have an opinion on the soy protein that gets put in these
<BR>
&gt; white tunas? I suppose it is 'forbidden', but how much is in those
<BR>
&gt; cans anyway?</FONT></TT><BR>
<BR>
I wouldn't worry about how much soy is in there, just avoid it. In my stores<BR>
it is quite easy to find tuna with only tuna, water, and salt as ingredients<BR>
listed, or tuna, and oil. Read all the labels on the shelf and see if you<BR>
can't find a good one before accepting the soy one. I don't think Elaine
would<BR>
approve of the soy at all. Someone compared it to the difference between
corn<BR>
and corn oil, the latter being allowed. I don't know if this is the case<BR>
because soy milk and rice milk are not allowed either. I could be wrong<BR>
though.<BR>
<BR>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&gt; I was one who complained a couple of months ago about
some of the way <BR>
&gt; out advice that was passing back and forth, but was convinced by <BR>
&gt; others that in moderation anything is O.K. All I care about is that
<BR>
&gt; the main focus doesn't turn to another area of treatment altogether.
<BR>
&gt; In fact, it was here that I heard about DHEA. I have been taking 25mg
<BR>
&gt; daily for about two months, and must say that no real effect is <BR>
&gt; noticeable. Anyone else?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Bart Hansen<BR>
&gt; hansenb@frb.gov<BR>
&gt; Alexandria, VA</FONT></TT><BR>
<BR>
Bart, I have been taking DHEA too, obtained by prescription from an ND in
a<BR>
famous clinic in Washington state. I made a special trip down there from<BR>
Canada where I live, and spent thousands of dollars to do this. I was counting<BR>
on the experience of the doctors at this clinic. They are supposively world<BR>
renowned for their work with DHEA and other alternative therapies. An MD
heads<BR>
the clinic (called Tahoma Clinic) and several NDs and other alternative<BR>
practitioners work there.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, I ended up with a lifetime refillable prescription for DHEA
which<BR>
is a high quality pharmaceutical grade product, prepared by the pharmacy.
They<BR>
say it is better than the stuff you buy over-the-counter (which is not<BR>
legally available at all in Canada, by the way), but God only knows the
truth. <BR>
I just keep buying it from the pharmacy in Kent, Washington. To tell the
truth, I<BR>
don't know if it helped me or not. I find this to be true with many of the<BR>
vitamins, supplements, or even drugs for that matter. Unless you only do
or<BR>
use one thing at a time, how can you possibly know or prove that any one
of the<BR>
things is working or having any effect. For example, I took Asacol for ages,<BR>
but I have no idea whether it did anything for me. I happen to Know that<BR>
Prednisone had an effect, and I know that the SCD had an effect. But those
two<BR>
are the only things I know for sure. I still take the DHEA because it may
be<BR>
helping me, and I don't think it is harming me. I did a lot of research
and<BR>
reading on the subject, and that's how I came to this decision for myself.
I<BR>
take about 30mg a day. My theoretical reason for taking it is that it helps<BR>
get the adrenal glands working again after being on Prednisone for a long
time.<BR>
The prednisone shuts down those glands, which are VERY important for proper<BR>
body functioning overall. Anyway, I think that if people are interested
in<BR>
DHEA, they should do some reading and then decide if it is for them. If
I had<BR>
it to do over again, I wouldn't bother seeking the advice of an MD or a<BR>
Naturopathic doctor for that matter because they all have a different opinion<BR>
on DHEA, and there are no standard treatment protocals for this<BR>
supplement. In other words, when it comes to dosage prescribing, they are
all<BR>
pretty much making it up as they go along and we are the guinea pigs. I
have<BR>
no problem with being that, but if I already know their theories behind
it, I<BR>
can figure out my own dosage. They usually start you out on about 5 - 15
mg<BR>
per day, and see what happens. If the patient gets side effects, like acne,
the<BR>
dosage is assumed to be too high, and is reduced. 5mg per day is a perfectly<BR>
safe dose. I figured all this out from a very good book which seems to be<BR>
written in a non-biased way. Many doctors are quoted as to their methods
and<BR>
theories on the subject and research studies are cited as to what DHEA will
and<BR>
will not do. The author seems very scientifically minded, and he actually
says<BR>
so when there is no solid proof that it works for certain things. Anyway,
for<BR>
people who are wondering if they should take it, get this book. I found
it at<BR>
my public library and it was a very interesting read.
