<FONT COLOR="#800080" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial, helvetica">&gt;Hi Anna,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Thanks for your response and telling me your experience with the allergy<BR>
&gt;testing.  I too am skeptical that the allergy tests will turn up<BR>
&gt;anything.  But I actually am glad you're telling me to really not get my<BR>
&gt;hopes up, so I won't get them up.  I hate when I get my hopes up and<BR>
&gt;then there's nothing conclusive.  I have had enough of vague responses<BR>
&gt;from health practitioners!  I'm going to do mine through the Meridian<BR>
&gt;lab in Washington state, a blood test.  Right now I am doing a process<BR>
&gt;of elimination thing, which is grueling because sometimes I don't get a<BR>
&gt;reaction for 72 hrs after I've eaten something.  Major drag.<BR>
&gt;  I want to ask you, what are the beginning signs of the anaphalaxis<BR>
&gt;thing, as you experience it?  I know what a full blown anaphalctic<BR>
&gt;reaction is, but I have a feeling I might have some tiny ones because my<BR>
&gt;face gets red and sometime my chest feels slightly tight for a few<BR>
&gt;minutes, could be like an asthma thing too.  I am trying to avoid foods<BR>
&gt;that do this, but it is painstaking work.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Take care,<BR>

Hi Denise,<BR>
Meridian Valley Labs in Kent, Washington is connected with the Tahoma Clinic<BR>
where I went to see Dr. Lamson.  He's an ND, who has a reputation for<BR>
successfully treating IBD.  My ex-boyfriend, who was also an ND told me to go<BR>
to Lamson.  I ended up with a lifetime refillable prescription for DHEA, and<BR>
I'm supposed to keep in touch with him via phone consultations.  The whole<BR>
thing was very pricey, and even a short phone call is $85 US.  I live in<BR>
Canada, so going down there was a big deal.  Whether or not the DHEA helped, I<BR>
still don't know.  Maybe it helped me get off prednisone, but maybe not.  I<BR>
can't tell.  I still take it on and off, in case it does do something.<BR>
<BR>
I had a variety of lab tests done in that lab and the results were all pretty<BR>
much worthless.  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't really bother.  Instead, I<BR>
would have gotten this book by Ray Sahlien (not sure about the spelling) about<BR>
DHEA.  The book is excellent.  He interviews doctors all across North America<BR>
about their practices and experiences with this new and controversial<BR>
supplement.  It gives dosage recommendations and everything.  It's well worth<BR>
reading.  It reports the truth, not just the pretty picture of DHEA.  Like, the<BR>
fact that there is really no evidence of it helping certain diseases, etc.  I<BR>
got it at the library.  Anyway, the point behind this story is that the blood<BR>
allergy test there is the same as all the other tests I had there.  Costly, and<BR>
not very useful.  This is just my opinion.  If someone had told me that prior<BR>
to when I went there, I may have gone ahead anyway, but I just thought I'd give<BR>
my experience.  I do think the lab is good.  They do tests there that MDs don't<BR>
even know about.  Some of the tests were actually invented by Dr. Wright, the<BR>
Director of the Tahoma Clinic.  He has written several books as well.  Anyway,<BR>
if you think that this allergy thing is really the problem, then this blood<BR>
test is probably the best out of all the choices out there (in terms of allergy<BR>
testing).  I mean, it's probably better than Vega Testing, or MD scratch<BR>
testing. (It sounds like what you're getting is an IgG IgE test.)  But again, I<BR>
have my doubts because the results I got were so ambiguous with what I already<BR>
knew to be true.  And if I tried to live my life according to those results, it<BR>
would be very difficult if not impossible.  The results list like 200 foods,<BR>
spices, etc, and 1/2 of them I am supposively intolerant to on some level, so I<BR>
am supposed to rotate or eliminate them.  It's very complex to implement.  I<BR>
found that the SCD was easier to handle.  Doing both regiments at the same time<BR>
is hard.  I did try both.  The allergy results just didn't impress me.<BR>
<BR>
To answer your question about the anaphalaxis symptoms, If I eat raw carrots,<BR>
kiwi fruit, avacado, or raw hazelnuts, I get the same reaction. The inside of<BR>
my mouth and throat gets all tingly and feels sort of burning and my throat<BR>
starts to tighten up.  Breathing is a little harder too.  My lips and mouth<BR>
swell a little.  The whole thing is VERY unpleasant and a bit scary at times.<BR>
These are signs of an allergic reaction, and if I continue to eat these foods,<BR>
I risk actually getting an actual anaphalactic shock reaction.  I have tempted<BR>
fate every now and then, like eating a little bite of one of those foods every<BR>
6 months or something, just to test it out.  When I get the same reaction<BR>
again, I know it is still true.  You see, allergies can come and go over the<BR>
years.  In a way, many times, people can DEVELOP allergies to things from<BR>
eating them too much.  This was the case for me with Kiwi, because I used to<BR>
eat just tons of them because my aunt grew them and every summer we'd eat them<BR>
every day.  Back then it didn't effect me, but then years later when I tried<BR>
one, I got the reaction.  With the other items I mentioned, I don't recall<BR>
eating too much of them, so these ones just developed for unknown reasons.  But<BR>
the point is, I didn't always have the allergy.  I used to eat avacados and<BR>
carrots with no problem.  Some of the reactions are milder than others.  Like,<BR>
avacado gives me a mild reaction, but if I drink anything with carrot juice for<BR>
example, it's very scary.  I simply avoid it completely because it IS so scary<BR>
when your throat starts to close up and you can't breathe.  I've never had to<BR>
go to the hospital for this though.  I just wait a while until it passes.  It<BR>
takes a few hours for it to go away.  The funny thing was, none of these foods<BR>
even showed up at all on my IgG IgE blood test results.  That's the main reason<BR>
I doubted them.<BR>
Hope this info helps in your quest for the answers.<BR>
Anna<BR>

Lactose Intolerance: Not an Allergy<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Lactose intolerance is not a food allergy but an inability to digest a sugar
found in dairy products.<BR>
[U.S. Pharmacist 22(5):21-22, 26-27, 1997]<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Author: W. Steven Pray, Ph.D., R.Ph., Professor, Pharmaceutics, School of
Pharmacy, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Excerpts:<BR>
======<BR>
Lactose intolerance is one of a number of food intolerances. The term &quot;food
intolerance&quot; denotes a nonimmunologically based inability to properly
metabolize certain food groups. <BR>
<BR>
The lay public often confuses lactose intolerance with an allergy to milk.
Milk allergy is an immunologic problem that is different from lactose intolerance
in its causes and treatments. <BR>
<BR>
It is estimated that 25% of American adults and 75% of adults worldwide
have lactose intolerance; as many as 7.5 million Americans suffer from severe
lactose intolerance. It is present in 15% of white adults, 45% of Eskimos,
81% of black adults, and 100% of Asian adults.<BR>
<BR>
Symptoms of cow's milk protein allergy include vomiting (which is uncommon
in lactose intolerance), diarrhea (perhaps bloody stools), angio-edema,
urticaria, rhinitis, nasal congestion and wheezing.<BR>

Hello all,<BR><BR>

A website for food allergies: <A HREF="http://www.foodallergy.org/alerts.html">
http://www.foodallergy.org/alerts.html</A>
There is a special section where warnings are issued regarding
misinformation in labeling of food products.  Thought this might be of
value to some of us on the
list.<BR><BR>

Subject: <B>food tolerance</B><BR>



<P>Just my two cents worth on the sugject of food intolerances -


<P>I have been on the diet for almost 2 years, and have virtually
elimintated all symptoms, and lead a normal life (except I cook more
often, and eat out less than your average person).  I have had funny
reactions to just about all the foods on the diet at one time or
another, be it diareah, bleeding, or funny sensations in my stomach.
Early on, while my symptoms were somewhat severe, I just trusted the
diet - I KNEW that the nut flour was still irritating to my sensitive,
damaged colon. Nonetheless, I &quot;suffered&quot; through it, with the hope and
faith that, even though I was still reacting, I was getting better, and
that my reactions to what I was eating would subside as I got better.


<P>Guess what?  They have!  Now I can eat the nut flour without any fear of
irritating my colon, which has achieved a relatively high level of
resiliency.  I still think that my diet is a bit rich, and when I eat
enough to feel sufficiently &quot;full&quot;, I think I've ingested too much for
my system to adequately handle, and I get some discomfort.  As long as I
balance and don't overeat, everything is cool. Sometimes I wish I could
&quot;fill up&quot; on something, like rice, or a potato, which give one that
&quot;full&quot; sensation without overloading the system (unless, of course you
have some IBD).  I suggest living with some discomfort/pain if that's
necessary to stick to the diet. Of course, avoid it where possible
(like, don't go eating raw carrots and broccoli when you can easily
steam them to make 'em easier to breakdown and less abraisive to your
system). For me, the nut flour and yoghurt, which at times I suspected
were troublesome, were the main staples of my diet in terms of bulk
(along with fruit, veg &amp; meat) but I stuck with it, and now I 'm very
glad I did.


<P>This is my experience. Please proceed at your own risk, as I'm no
doctor! (But I am feeling alot better that I was 2 years ago!)<P>

<P>It is my understanding that the body will develop allergies to foods
that are
eaten with continued frequency.  I used to eat too much chicken and
potatoes
and my allergy tests were 4 on a scale of 4 for allergy for chicken and
potatoes.  I stopped eating my allergic foods, gave my body a chance to
clear
out and now I can eat these foods but on a three day alternating
schedule.
The three day time frame supposedly allows my body to not start building
up an
allergen to the foods again.  Alternating is fairly easy, I just
remember not
to eat something again for three days.  I also have to watch out for
food
families.  I can't eat brussel sprouts within three days of eating
broccoli
(same family).  

Weight loss:  I go to all bones on no flour products or pastas.  I had
to find
rice flour breads, waffles and pastas.  I am gluten allergic and was
getting
too too thin on no flour products.  I am careful to not eat any gluten
flour
product.
