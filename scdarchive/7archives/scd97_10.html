<B>digestive enzymes<BR></B>

Carol,<BR>
I know that in theory it seems that digestive enzymes of different types should
be able to allow us to eat different foods that are not allowed on the SCD. 
However, in practice, I don't think they work.  The problem is, there are
millions of different types of enzymes for different foods.  Maybe us IBDers
don't have all the right ones working for us, and it is impossible to predict
which pills to eat with which foods.  I was just reading a book by Andrew Weil
yesterday, and he said digestive enzymes are worthless.  Not that I believe
absolutely everything he says, because I don't, but he had a good argument.  I
can't recall the exact words right now, but I will get the book and tell you
what it said tomorrow.<BR><BR>

I tried a few different types of enzymes.  Some were over-the-counter that I
picked up myself, and one time my Naturopathic Doctor gave me some
Disacharidase Enzymes.  He told me they were experimental and wanted me to test
them out.  They did nothing, as far as I could tell, even though I was
optimistic about them.  He was also a "researcher in the field" in a way,
because he actually had these pills specially made up by a company, which did
not manufacture the product.  He told me that one woman with UC reported being
"cured" after taking an over the counter enzyme.  After this, he decided to try
different ones.  He figured that she must have lucked out and got the right
enzyme that she was lacking.<BR>
Anyway, Elaine says in the book not to rely on enzymes, although she does tell
people they can use a little Lactaid milk in coffee or add Lactaid drops to
cottage cheese which is questionable.<BR>

All cheeses have some lactose. The ones on the diet all contain lactose in
quantities less than 1% butter contains much less and is virtually all fat.
whereas cheese is really low lactose rather than lactose-free.<BR><BR>

Anna,<BR>

This is the *Specific* carbohydrate diet not the "NO Carbohydrate Diet"<BR>
otherwise it would be called the Atkins Diet and it would be life<BR>
threateningly dangerous to be on. You really need starches and<BR>
polysaccharides in your diet, it's just a matter of which ones. Elaine has<BR>
analysed all the foods on the diet and no others and certifies that they<BR>
are not conducive to pathogenic microbes.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><TT>&gt;I need your help,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I have been on the diet since November (OK I cheated a little over<BR>
&gt;Christmas and<BR>
&gt;New Year's). It started off really well, but now I'm not doing so well.
I can't<BR>
&gt;get rid of the D. I've been sticking to the diet since January 3rd,
and since<BR>
&gt;last Saturday I've only been eating the bland diet that Elaine suggests
for<BR>
&gt;people who are just starting out. (Broiled beef patty, chicken broth,
cheese<BR>
&gt;cake, etc). I'm also eating Lang's bread. The problem is that it's still
not<BR>
&gt;working.<BR>
&gt;I know that the book says that the D might come back after a couple
of months<BR>
&gt;and to stick to the diet. But how long is the D supposed to last? And
what<BR>
&gt;should I be eating? I'm restricting myslef to Lang's bread, broiled
patties,<BR>
&gt;chicken broth, yoghurt,  cheese cake and Welch's grape juice.<BR>
&gt;Is it possible that this diet won't work for me?<BR>
&gt;Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Mike</TT></FONT><BR>
<BR>
I would not be on the Lang's bread if you have diarrhea. the almond meal<BR>
being quite gritty can actually be quite abrassive to the gut lining when<BR>
it's that far gone.and can actually promote diarrhea The diet is not a<BR>
substitute for aggresive medical treatment. you may need:<BR>
<BR>
Anti-diarreah medication<BR>
complete gut-rest on a drip<BR>
Antibiotics<BR>
Cortisone<BR>
and Rehydration therapy<BR>
<BR>
It usually only takes less than a week for doctors to get a bowel into<BR>
remission in this case if the basic diet doesn't do it alone, use the<BR>
doctors or both. You  could add some fresh squeezed vege juices  (avoid<BR>
fresh fruit juice as it can promote diarrhea) stewed apples only and or
a<BR>
VERY ripe bannana and when the diarrhea settles, plenty of steamed veges<BR>
(include pumpkin, squash and swede for enough calories to heal) and fish<BR>
and chicken (safer for a leaky gut) don't add the nut flour until you BM's<BR>
are normal (no bleeding or diarrhea) you may find that RAW TIEN CHI and<BR>
XIANG LIAN WAN are two herbs taken 3 times a day that may help greatly<BR>
(chinese herbal treatments) and Slippery Elm also helps with the low grade<BR>
fevers that come from a toxic gut.<BR>

PS keep your fridge, kitchen and bathroom sparkling clean and disinfected
-<BR>
its easy to pick up a pathogen from these areas.

<B>Fascinating homeopathic case!!</B><BR>
Tue, 21 Jan 1997 8:21:28 GMT<BR>
<BR>
The below url contains a fascinating case presentation by a classical<BR>
homeopath about a woman with chronic constipation/diarrhea. If you are<BR>
thinking of going to a homeopath to treat your IBD, you might read this<BR>
first to see how they think...discussion among other homeopaths to discuss<BR>
remedy...case followed for a year. A classical, constitutional homeopath<BR>
will take your entire case...tons of symptoms (not just digestive) and will<BR>
give you ONE REMEDY. In this case, the doctor chose wrong (but some of the<BR>
others did not) and she explains what she missed and how she got back on
track. <BR>

&gt;Michael, how long have you been on the diet you seem very knowlegable?
This<BR>
&gt;is my second week, so far I haven't had any results. I'm not giving
up but I<BR>
&gt;do wonder how long before I can see some results? Thanks and keep up
the<BR>
&gt;Good Work-<BR>
&gt;Renay<BR>

<BR>
Hi Renay,<BR>
<BR>
Welcome! I've been on the diet in earnest since last september and was<BR>
doing well until mid october. and only this month January am I getting back<BR>
on top of it. If you have UC you can expect to see less dramatic results<BR>
than with Crohnes, You must address the issues of Stress; Sleep and rest;<BR>
Oxygen and Fresh air; and getting enough Carbohydrates that you feel warm<BR>
and energized after meals. One month should see some improvements. If your<BR>
problem is more Yeast based, get one clove of garlic into you twice a day<BR>
and chew on one of them. Not very tastey but it will help to kill the<BR>
yeast. You will also feel worse to start with if thats the case, then you<BR>
will pick up.<BR>
<BR>

&gt;Dear Ryan,<BR>
&gt;The chocolate issue seems to be the most frequently asked question.
It<BR>
&gt;seems to be disallowed simply because it's chocolate. When I asked Elaine<BR>
&gt;about it, she indicated that it's not allowed in any way, shape or form.<BR>
&gt;Sorry, but it's the one thing I miss most too.<BR>
&gt;Sincerely, Rachel<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;I don't understand messages like this.... I'm 16, and I'm on the diet.
It's<BR>
&gt;not the chocolates that are the worst, or even the cokes. To me, it
is the<BR>
&gt;fact that every time I want to go eat somewhere with my friends, I simply<BR>
&gt;cannot. Or if I do, I have to take a thermos of chicken soup... resturaunts<BR>
&gt;aren't crazy about that. It's the grains and sugars that are the main
part of<BR>
&gt;this, and they are what's the hardest for me. -Mike Nestrud<BR>
<BR>
Dear Mike,<BR>
I sympathize deeply with your prediciment. I also applaud you for being<BR>
able, at 16, to have the discipline to go to restaurant carrying chicken<BR>
soup. However if not being on the diet means to you what it did to me,<BR>
which included pain,bloat and having to run to the bathroom every 2<BR>
seconds, then the thermos of soup ain't so bad. Maybe the day will<BR>
eventually come when you can allow yourself the occasional treat. Maybe<BR>
your folks would consider allowing your friends to visit your home where<BR>
you have better control over the menu (maybe some of them would even like<BR>
some of your soup). In any case as we all know, life is about choices. It<BR>
can't hurt to invest in your future by taking the best possible care of<BR>
your body now. In any case, good luck.<BR>
