        1) The following things have been questioned as to whether they are<BR>
   allowed or not on the diet.  Could you please comment:<BR>
<LI> Pectin, naturally present in many fruits<BR>
    .... why is it not usable in jams, jellies?<BR>
<LI> Plantain bananas and plantain banana chips (no sugar added)<BR>
<LI> Cashews roasted by oneself<BR>
<LI> Fructose or glucose sweetener, <BR>
  which are found with other sweeteners like Saccharin<BR>
<LI> Kidney, pink, red, pinto and other common beans<BR>
<LI> Fresh fennel<BR>
<BR>
Answers:<BR>
Pectin is an indigestible soluble fiber which is normally not digested but
<BR>
which increases microbial (bacteria and yeast) growth when it reaches the
<BR>
lower part of the tract.  It appears that the amount in fruit is not too
<BR>
much of a problem (although it may be the reason for gas after eating<BR>
fruit).  If you add pectin you are adding more nourishment for the yeast<BR>
and bacteria we are trying to starve out.  <BR>
<BR>
If you can be sure there is no sweetener added to plantain and banana chips
<BR>
then they are OK.<BR>
<BR>
Cashews roasted by yourself are just fine.<BR>
<BR>
Fructose or glucose sweeteners (with saccharin, etc) are not really <BR>
monosaccharides as I have explained before; they are a mixture of many <BR>
sugars.  If you can find pure dextrose it appears that when the name<BR>
dextrose (actually another name for glucose) appears on something, it may
<BR>
very well be a monosaccharide.  However, I cannot keep up with what<BR>
companies are doing and I am even not sure of this.<BR>
<BR>
Kidney beans are OK but I am not sure about pinto.  Black beans are OK.
 You<BR>
can do a lot with ordinary white navy beans.  Since I do not know the<BR>
analysis of other beans and since Dr. Haas approved of the ones I allow,<BR>
I have been satisfied to use the white, the kidney, and sometimes black.<BR>
<BR>
Fresh fennel is similar to celery and is OK.  It is very fibrous and only<BR>
those who are practically without symptoms should eat all that fiber.  If<BR>
people already have a narrowing at the ileum, these stringy and very <BR>
fibrous foods can plug them up further.<BR>

        2) What could be the causes of extreme bloating shortly<BR>
    after eating? Any ways to alleviate this? Any particular<BR>
    foods to avoid? Any connection to yeast overgrowth problem?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
The extreme bloating is probably caused by too much raw fruit and <BR>
vegetables or mixing a lot of beans with a lot of protein.  If you study<BR>
the diagram on page 17 you will see that gases (carbon dioxide, hydrogen,
<BR>
and methane gas) can be formed by yeast and bacterial fermentation.  These<BR>
gases cause bloating.  And by the way all these IBD problems can be <BR>
related to yeast overgrowth.  When I use the word MICROBIAL, I mean yeast<BR>
and/or bacteria.<BR>

        <IMG SRC="../images/pil.gif" WIDTH="7" HEIGHT="7" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">3) 
        Question concerning fermented food.<BR>
    I have added sauerkraut to my diet.  I don't like it, but I read that
<BR>
    fermented foods such as yoghurt, apple cider vinegar, and sauerkraut
<BR>
    add that very valuable lactobacillus acidophilus to the intestinal tract.
 <BR>
    Is sauerkraut legal?  Does Elaine know anything else about fermented
foods?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Sauerkraut is very legal but be careful that it does not have added sugar.<BR>
The yoghurt is one of the best fermented foods but only homemade.  Apple<BR>
cider vinegar is OK.<BR>

        4) I'd like to ask Elaine about Pentasa, what she thought of it <BR>
    and whether we need to get off it to make the diet truly &quot;successful&quot;.<BR>
    If we do get off it what should we be taking instead?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
I cannot comment too much on the drugs.  Pentasa is a time-release Asacol.
 <BR>
If the person thinks it is helping, the diet will still have its good effects.
 <BR>
Especially for colitis, the drug of choice for years was AZULFIDINE  <BR>
(salazopyrene).  It may not be as good for small intestinal Crohn's.  <BR>
This sulfa drug (Azulfindine) should be started slowly and worked up to
levels <BR>
the &quot;Merck Manual&quot; recommends to the doctor.  If you do not start
out slowly, <BR>
some people develop an allergy to it.  Like all drugs it has some side effects
<BR>
... the druggist is your best bet for that information.<BR>

        5) Someone told me that if you buy something called Beano and place 3-4 
        drops <BR>
    on the first mouthful of gastric food, it helps to eliminate the gas
<BR>
    and helps you to digest.  I'd really like to hear Elaine's comments
on Beano <BR>
    and whether it can be used in the soaking water instead of &quot;in
vivo&quot;.  <BR>
    I know it's destroyed by heat but maybe it would work in the cold water?
 <BR>
    Elaine is not a big fan of 'in vivo' digestive enzymes, <BR>
    but I don't know why.<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
I am in the midst of a family crisis right now and I have forgotten how<BR>
Beano works.  I recall that it broke some of the chemical bonds in the bean<BR>
sugars.  As for &quot;in vivo&quot; enzymes I had a few papers that said
it did not<BR>
work for lactose.  Unless you used &quot;Lactaid&quot; in the milk before
drinking<BR>
as contrasted to taking the milk and &quot;Lactaid&quot; at the same time,
it would<BR>
not work.  If the Beano helps in starch digestion, I would think it is OK.<BR>
I also think that digestive enzymes should be OK.  Many people have tried<BR>
them without the diet and get little results.  Perhaps with the diet,<BR>
digestive enzymes could and would help.<BR>

        6) Some direction on vitamins, minerals, supplements,<BR>
    homeopathic/naturopathic remedies etc.  Have seen people talking<BR>
    about ... omega-3 fatty acids, wheatgrass juice, flax seed oil, Cat's<BR>
    Claw, fish oil, evening primrose oil, folic acid, Biotin ... there are<BR>
    so many!<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
I cannot give much direction on homeopathics, etc.  I have tried alternative<BR>
methods when I have had problems and some work and some don't.  <BR>
I have given you as much vitamin information as I can.  I cannot spend years<BR>
looking into different brands.  Some doctors, like Dr. Galland &amp; Dr.
Hoffman, <BR>
use grapefruit-seed extract and fish oil.  Could not a member of your group<BR>
tell what effects fish oil has had? I have seen a lot of hype on fish oil<BR>
lately and I would rely more on experience with it than hype.<BR>

        7) Why are canned vegetables forbidden even if the ingredients <BR>
    don't include anything forbidden, especially since canned fruit <BR>
    and vegetable juices are allowed?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Canned fruit and vegetables are just fine if you do them yourself.  There<BR>
are pages and pages of legal testimony showing how deceptive the labels<BR>
are on commercially canned products.  One case has been in the Federal<BR>
Courts for 10 years filed against Everfresh, one of the biggest producers<BR>
of juice.  I am just afraid of deception.  But if you do it yourself, that<BR>
is just fine.<BR>

        8) Why does one have to wait before drinking almond milk?<BR>

Answer:<BR>
I do not know how the almond milk is made.  If a person gets over his/her<BR>

        9) Why is butter OK?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Butter is a natural product from which all the milk protein lactoalbumin
<BR>
(highly allergenic) and lactose (residual amounts) have been removed in
<BR>
the process of making it.  Margarine is completely manufactured in that<BR>
the oil is hydrogenated (trans fatty acids) and additional milk solids<BR>
are added including lactose.<BR>

        10) Are beets allowed (I can't remember; my doctor has my book currently).<BR>
    If they're not (I seem to remember something about beet sugar), then<BR>
    why not? Fruit has plenty of sugar in it too.<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Beets are OK even though they contain sucrose.  I realize there are<BR>
inconsistencies in the diet but I always go back to what Dr. Haas told me.<BR>

11) What is the difference between red and white wine, dietwise?<BR>
    Naturally, the yeast in the wine is one part of the answer, but why<BR>
    dry whites instead of reds, especially if grape juice itself is okay?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Wines - I think dry red and white wine are OK. <BR>
I believe that adding sucrose is added to the wines,<BR>
and in a not so dry wine, some of the sugar remains.<BR>

        12) Is &quot;Lactaid 100&quot; milk allowed on the SCD? I understand 100% 
        of the<BR>
    lactose has been removed.  If so, can &quot;Lactaid 100&quot; be used
for an SCD<BR>
    yogurt?  Could this yogurt be cooked fewer hours so it would not be
so<BR>
    acidic and sour since the lactose has been removed?  Would we need to<BR>
    use a lactose-free starter? Are there any other SCD items that could<BR>
    be made from &quot;Lactaid 100&quot;?<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Two books have been written on this product and it should not be drunk by
<BR>
the glass by people on the diet.  Because the liver plays a big part in<BR>
converting galactose to glucose and because &quot;Lactaid&quot; has been
broken down <BR>
to glucose and galactose, it is feared that in IBD where all the digestive<BR>
organs may not be working 100%, including the liver, then lots of the <BR>
galactose in the &quot;Lactaid&quot; would build up in the blood just like
glucose <BR>
builds up in a diabetic.<BR>

        13) What is the premise behind the expected flare-up<BR>
    at 2-3 months into the diet?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
<BR>
The flareup is a mystery.  I do not know why it occurs ... I could speculate
<BR>
but it is very involved and I am probably not correct.  <BR>
There are lots of mysteries with the illness that cannot be explained by
anyone.<BR>

    turkey which contains only &quot;turkey, water and salt&quot;.  Is the
problem<BR>

        <BR>
    tomatoes from the health food store, and there are no added <BR>

<BR>
Answer:<BR>
If you write to the company and they say there is nothing added to the canned
<BR>
tomatoes, use them.  I know that tomato juice works great in most recipes
<BR>
requiring tomato puree or canned tomatoes.  If you cook them and freeze
them <BR>

    book, I realize that I didn't start out with the introductory part of<BR>
    the diet, I just leapt right in eating everything: beans, nuts, etc.<BR>
    that probably should have waited a while, so: should I &quot;start all<BR>
    over&quot; with a week of the introductory diet and stop eating beans
and<BR>
    nuts for awhile? (I've already seen slow, steady improvement in my 9<BR>
    weeks on the diet the way I've done it).<BR>

    or in what may be added?<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Maple syrup (naturally) has sucrose just as honey naturally has single<BR>
sugars.  (Editor's note: maple syprup, like apple juice &amp; perhaps other
fruit <BR>
juices, can have formaldehyde and/or other chemicals added to it without
needig <BR>
to be labelled as having them, so if you find any item problematic, that
might <BR>
be why: foods that contain &quot;additives&quot; but aren't required by

    one forbidden meal per week undo the healing that has taken place? <BR>
    (Bet Elaine won't like this question!)<BR>
<BR>
Answer:<BR>
Elaine does not mind this question but I cannot answer it.  Everyone is
<BR>
different.  I would certainly not start introducing large amounts of<BR>
forbidden foods and mixing food up.  I would, for example, start with 1/4<BR>
of a small potato, skip a day and repeat every other day for about a week.

    and not for others?<BR>

Answer:<BR>
I do not know why the diet does not work for all - it may be caused in the
<BR>
cases that do not respond by a mutated bacteria which is not a big carbo
<BR>
eater but I really don't know.  The immune system is much involved with<BR>
especially ulcerative colitis and no one has a clue what is happening.<BR>

Hi,<BR>
<BR>
I've had a bit of an idea, so let's see how it goes.  I don't know if<BR>
Christine is still with us, if she is she must be too busy or sick to read
<BR>
the mail since a number of people have tried to raise her about the <BR>
&quot;Questions for Elaine&quot;.  I hope it's the former and not the latter.
 <BR>
Anyway, I have created a new e-mail address for questions to Elaine.  <BR>
When I accumulate about 20, I'll fax them to her.<BR>
<BR>
So please send your questions to Elaine to:<BR>
<BR>
  <DD>  <A HREF="mailto:scdquestions@filmgraphics.com">scdquestions@filmgraphics.com</A><BR>
<BR>
If the question has already been answered, I'll direct you to the answer<BR>
either in the book or if I'm busy or I think someone in the group can<BR>
answer it, I'll forward it to the group.  If no one is able to answer the<BR>
question, then please resend the question to the same e-mail address as
<BR>
given a second time and I'll leave it there for Elaine to answer.  I think<BR>
this is necessary so that we don't overload Elaine with repeating <BR>
questions and so she is not too overwhelmed so we wear out our welcome.<BR>
<BR>
So get those questions going and send them in now!<BR>

Elaine answered my letter.  The following is what she said:<BR>
<BR>
Rice Dream - NO<BR>
Grain vinegar - OK<BR>
Canned olives - OK<BR>
Dill relish - homemade only, as commercial ones have sugar<BR>
Granulated fructose - NO, only pure dextrose is OK<BR>
Wine - any very dry wine, red or white, <BR>
       marked &quot;0&quot; for sweetness level zero.<BR>
Substitution for milk in coffee: a little &quot;Lactaid&quot; can be used.<BR>
Mesasol is a 5ASA drug with no starch or lactose apparently.  You can ask<BR>
    your doctor about switching to it, if Asacol or some other one is <BR>
    bothering you.  The diet will definitely help IBS also.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, I noticed that a more recently printed edition of &quot;Breaking
<BR>
The Vicious Cycle&quot; had a few additions, like the instructions on Glucose,
<BR>
Fructose, or any combination of the two.  It says not to have any beverages<BR>
containing these.  This was a surprise to me, as I had been buying some
<BR>
with it in.<BR>
<BR>
If you're in the bookstore, pick up a new copy and glance through it.<BR>
